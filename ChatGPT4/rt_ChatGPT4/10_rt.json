        "document": "A fascinating exercise in historical fill-in-the-blanks.the story of how a fascist dictator was overthrown by dopey TV commercialsAn expansive political thriller.Bernal plays the creative type perfectly. His big eyes always seem to be seeing things that others don't, and through his calm, methodical demeanor, you can sense the wheels turning in his head.The story of it, while true to the moment, needed - ironically - much more dynamism.\"No\" signals a huge spurt in the filmmaker's growth.Starring Gael Garcia Bernal, the third, fact-based panel in Larrain's political films about the Pinochet regime, is just as riveting as the previous ones.For anyone fascinated by the political process and the powers of persuasive advertising, No is a resounding yes.It's a perfectly fine movie, but given its fairly radical storyline, the filmmaking tends to hew toward the safe and the familiar.\"No\" gives a fresh look at the little known history of a country whose duly elected government under Salvador Allende was overthrown in a military coup led by Pinochet in 1973.A troubling, exhilarating and ingeniously realized film that's part stirring political drama and part devilish media satire ...Say yes to \"No.\"[Lorrain has] made a few daring choices here, not all of which work.Larra\u00edn's unarguable point is that, in politics, if we wait for good to issue only from the pure in heart, we will be waiting a very long time.It hangs on three ideas...While each...is intriguing, the execution of all is less than satisfying.Nominated by the Academy as the year's best foreign-language film, No grabs you hard, no mercy, and keeps you riveted.It makes the superficial Mad Men seem like, well, a commercial. Buy, buy, buy.Larra\u00edn's script is punctuated by dark bursts of humour, and the filmmaker knowingly navigates his audience to a nail-biting - though never cloying, and fully warranted - climax.Evocative and suspenseful, the film is a fascinating glimpse into recent history and the democratic process.A fascinating period re-creation if not an especially compelling drama.Using a technique borrowed from cinema verit\u00e9 documentaries, the director succeeds in making us feel as if we're living each moment right alongside his politically-charged characters.The film highlights the sad fact that logical arguments don't win political debates or elections. Sloganeering and advertising do.A decisive transitional chapter in Chilean history yields an absorbing account of one country's unlikely route from oppression to democracyA hearty celebration of hard-earned democracy spiked with just enough of the director's acidly crooked humor to remind us whose house we're in.Larrain's bizarre decision to make his film blend in with its extensive passages of archive footage by shooting in U-matic - the default TV production format of the 1980s - makes for an uncomfortable cinematic viewing experience.The film provides a fascinating history lesson in the guise of backstage drama, honeycombed with antique-looking TV commercials full of Lycra-clad dancers and gambolling mimes.Larra\u00edn has serious form, and his film is at once worthy, skilfully made and hugely entertaining.The standout entry of the Directors' Fortnight sidebar and the closest thing to a masterpiece that I've seen so far here in Cannes.Tense throughout, even for history-savvy auds, but still rich in the sort of Andean-soil-black humor that made Larrain's previous work so distinctive.\"No\" is an ugly looking movie - literally - for an ugly time. It's smeary, with little pictorial beauty or detail, but its anti-aesthetic is purposeful and, after your eyes stop hurting, watchable and persuasive.A resounding yes.No, sadly, is a no-no from Chile's Pablo Larra\u00edn.The clash of ideas is fascinating because they boil down to what makes us human: are we driven by hope or fear?It's engaging and inventive, although the deliberately distressed video quality of the film can be hard on the eyes.For his third Pinochet-era movie, Chilean filmmaker Larrain has come up with his most breathtakingly original approach yet, telling a story anyone, anywhere can identify with while at the same time never pulling his political punches.A fascinating case study in basic-level democracy.No is hugely smart and intricate, but it also comes from the gut.A terrific and thrilling drama about the power of hope, of optimism, and of bravery in the face of intimidation, and very real and extreme physical danger.Initially jarring, the video aesthetic blends beautifully with period footage to give a smart depiction of a nation in transition. A well-deserved Oscar nominee.[VIDEO ESSAY] Gael Garcia Bernal's television adman-turned-political-commercial-creator Rene Saavedra is such an ethically ambiguous protagonist that \"No\" falls completely flat as a piece of agitprop cinema.A bitingly funny, fascinating and moving portrait of Pinochet's fall that's smartly shot and superbly performed.\"NO\" is an inspirational political drama in which the people are roused by the visual to overcome the vicious.It works as drama. And strangely, considering we know the outcome, it generates considerable suspense.Despite the light-heartedness, there's a hard, tense edge to the film.Shooting the entire film on video equipment of the era gives No some visual snap but it is very much a pedestrian, by-the-numbers docu-drama tale, with the emphasis on the former rather than the latter.NO is an important film - especially for people too young or too far removed from Pinochet's \"Dirty War\" to remember how horrifying the situation was in Argentina during the '70s and '80s. Bernal's screen presence goes a long way in making the movie workNo reminds us that wherever \"freedom\" must be sold to the public, a history of complacency, violence, and terror has to be overcome.Despite a lack of in-depth special features, No is still easy to recommend for its fascinating story that tells of a country getting the unique opportunity to decide its own future.For all its flaws, 'No' succeeds because the marketers sell the audience, too.... like Mad Men, it's a period piece set in the world of advertising and it pays a distracting (and sometimes humorous) amount of attention to period details.This witty, double-edged movie is no ordinary exercise in political cinema.Chilean filmmaker Pablo Larra\u00edn's last in a trilogy of films about his country's political landscape, No is the story of the 1988 national referendum which unseated a dictator.Deftly appropriates mediated history for fiction.Simultaneously uplifting and unsettling.Explores the power of popular dissent, and the coordinated persuasions of media, marketing, and targeted advertising in shaping the word no to invigorate a populace pessimistically conditioned to think that nothing will ever change for the good.Largely a gimmick picture: At all times, it looks like hastily assembled news footage shot on grainy videotape in 1988.The most unexpectedly riotous comedy in years -- one with more bite than usual.'No' is never a drag to watch, but paradoxically enough, its self-imposed cinematic restraints inhibit it from selling itself as effectively as it might have.It has its dull patches but manages to show with some flair both the awfulness of the Pinochet regime and how Chileans rose against it.An alluring lead performance from Bernal and a suitably low-key, almost purring soundtrack composed by Carlos CabezasLast of a trilogy of films about Chilean politics, told through the story of an ad man using positive images to persuade voters to reject a dictator.This exquisitely assembled film, driven by Larrain's pin-sharp direction and Bernal's rousing performance, turns a potentially dry subject into something uproariously funny and massively involving.Savvy, often brilliant ...A singular biopic and a snapshot of a society renewed, No unaffectedly celebrates faith in democracy, and, surprisingly, truth in advertising.\"We have to find a product that's appealing to people!\" says Garcia Bernal at one point. And that's just what Larra\u00edn's created with this Latin spin on Mad Men.Neatly combines political conflict with marketing satire to form a vivid look at the 1988 plebiscite that overthrew Chile's dictator Augusto PinochetDirector Pablo Larrain clearly wishes neither to sentimentalise the past, nor excoriate it with cynical satire; but this trepidation leaves his film feeling indecisive.This battle and this triumph of an ad executive makes NO the first great film of 2013, and Bernal's performance the one that will be the hardest to outshine.A cunning and richly enjoyable combination of high-stakes drama and media satire from Chilean director Pablo Larrain.No continually impresses for its slyness and savvy -- rarely has such an eyesore been so worth watching.A reflection of a moment in time, made in the image of that moment.Bernal deftly explores the layers of the character's complexity, including his political apathy.It's clear that the language of advertising has become universal, and that political commodities can be sold like soap. But toppling a dictatorship? Now there's a story.\"No\" is a picture that perches precariously on the cusp of a paradox.A canny comedy and cutting critique, Pablo Larra\u00edn's No looks back at the 1980 vote to extend or end Chilean autocrat Augusto Pinochet's rule through an adman's eyes.Freshens up a decades-old story with vibrant humor and a good sense of storytelling.\"No\" is filmmaking of the first order.Old technology plus the packaging of a revolution add up to a Yes...a bitter and knowing meditation on media manipulation and political subversion.An extremely perceptive and intriguing examination of the effect that media hype and spin have on the political process.All historical and little drama.Larrain deftly mixes social satire and historical drama.No is a great historical document as to how one very important revolution started with a commercial.... features a fine performance by Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal as young ad exec Ren\u00e9 Saavedra, who didn't, at first, quite realise what he was in for when he decided to assist in the bringing down of military dictator Augusto Pinochet.It's not easy material but it's truly fascinating, and expertly done.The understated performance by Bernal was inspiring, as was the pic.Silliness is on the side of the angels in a brilliant and highly entertaining film that's part political thriller, part media satire.Larrain does a fine job of making No look and sound authentic to its time period, although the VHS-quality photography, all washed-out with colors bleeding together as camcorders did in the '80s, is an occasional irritant.This is probably the best fact-based account of 1980s Chilean political advertising that I've seen this year.It features an enormously appealing lead performance by Gael Garcia Bernal, an impressively even-handed approach, and a dynamic visual gimmick.Larra\u00edn shows how idealism and venality sat side by side, how quickly the brutal circumstances in which Pinochet came to power were forgotten and how little seemed to change once he left.Gripping and suspenseful even though the ending is already known.The most cutting gag is just how much Saavedra's political ads resemble his recent campaign for a diet cola. And the punch line is that they work.No is an open conversation about the very means by which we understand ourselves and our societies, the way that we internalize advertising and news footage. It's a manifestation of national memory.[Director Pablo] Larrain has substituted the icy-veined harshness of his earlier films and replaced it with a celebratory, robust, truly cinematic sensibility.Writer-director Pablo Larra\u00edn includes much authentic footage from the 'No' and 'Yes' campaign ads, and adopts a complementary 1980s TV-video design.The best movie ever made about Chilean plebiscites, No thoroughly deserves its Oscar nomination for Best Foreign Film.An incredible and prescient real life story of how a savvy ad campaign brought about real political change.If there are fewer white-knuckle showdowns than in a Hollywood movie, the trade-off is a cool, ironic intelligence that ripples off the screen and up the years to where we live.It's a fascinating and surprisingly fun look behind the scenes of politics and media.\"No\" stands proudly in a select sub-category of historical fiction films that work, completely and satisfyingly, as their own movies.Garc\u00eda Bernal quietly carries this film as a soft-spoken kid in blue jeans and untucked shirt.An Oscar-nominated win for more than just political junkies.A worthy and a quite interesting slice of modern international history ...\"No\" isn't nearly as definitive or declarative as its title: It leaves viewers wondering whether they should cheer, shrug or shake their heads.There will have to be a hell of a lot of good movies released in 2013 for No not to make my list of the year's 10 best.It always retains a level of interest, especially for those of us who don't remember - or aren't old enough to remember - which side won.Paranoia mixes neatly with optimism in this dramedy about the ad campaign that made Chile democratic.Stirring as a celebration of voter empowerment, No may also inspire pangs of wistful nostalgia.A political drama, a personal drama, a sharp-eyed study of how the media manipulate us from all sides, No reels and ricochets with emotional force.Larrain fashions an unlikely crowd-pleaser from a historical episode that has its share of tragedy as well as triumph.A mesmerizing, realistic and often hilarious look at the politics of power and the power of ideas ...It's a funny look at the way the media warp public opinion, and a curiously hopeful one.Wildly colorful strokes, full of bitter humor.Swims upstream against high-definition with a defiantly lo-fi approach that's also ingeniously evocative of the historical period.Fascinating work from director Pablo Larrain and screenwriter Pedro Peirano, who manage to slip into the skin of a beleaguered country and detail the urgency of a revolution, sold one jingle at a time.If you can shake off the inherent grossness of mining the Pinochet years for yet another Mad Man-style deification of zeitgeist-grasping salesmen, this is moderately interesting stuff.On every level, \"No\" leaves one with bittersweet feelings about democracy, love and the cost of compromise.",

        "document": "What performances!Damon's portrayal adds a complex level of moral conflict.Although the conclusion is satisfying and well developed, the journey itself is the reward.You'll enjoy the superlative acting of Matt Damon, whose dimensions are tested and found in abundance here far more than they appear in his smaller role in Saving Private Ryan.Colorful performances!Damon, Norton are game, but Rounders script a letdown.When the movie is considering the relationship between the pros and their business, it has a place to go, implying that Mike could turn into one of these bozos.With fine acting all around and a colorful millieu to explore, there's plenty to take in.Rounders is not breakthrough material, but it makes for an entertaining evening out.Rounders is disappointing and fake, because its intentions are predictable as its characters are uninspired.You're going to hear a lot about the good job Edward Norton and Gretchen Mol do in Rounders. But the movie lives and dies with Matt Damon.A smart, lean, star-powered, character-driven melodrama.Mischievously entertaining!Takes you into a grungy underworld of high-stakes poker in New York City.For every good thing about Rounders there is a flaw.[Provides] a lot of entertainment as well as some food for thought.The \"good buddy, bad buddy\" symmetry harkens back to the days of James Cagney-Pat O'Brien pictures, but this is stylish enough to make us forgive the narrative conventions.It's a likable movie and a solid follow up for Damon.The fact that I was so motivated by the movie to put all that money on the table speaks positively of the picture.Other directors simply pay homage to film noir and their movies come across as copies or throwbacks, but Dahl's movies work because he seems to understand the inner workings of film noir, and the absurd situations that people can get into.It's too bad with all of the poker action there wasn't enough time to establish the relationships between characters.No energy!Rounders' script is pretty shabby going. Well, not shabby, really, just simplistic.Damon proves once again that he's not just a face, and he does wonders with his inner and outer conflicts. Norton is wickedly sleazy as a barely-in-control low life who will undoubtedly end up back in the slammer.Too lightweight!The movie is replete with all kinds of insider lingo that goes a long way toward painting a thoroughly convincing portrait of the gambling world.You're going to have an interesting evening.Matt Damon anchors Rounders with another rock solid performance.\"Rounders\" makes you feel the suspense and thrive in the thrill of the moment, always coming up aces.The end result is still short of a winning hand, since the screenplay is so utterly predictable.Intermittently engaging but dramatically slack.This ode to the allure of clipping suckers and psyching out the competition is richly atmospheric but thin in the character department.Gretchen Mol, Edward Norton, John Turturro, Martin Landau, and Famke Janssen costar; they're all pretty good, but not good enough to make this 1998 feature worth seeing.In his first non-noir film, John Dahl, assisted by the great French lenser Jean-Yves Escoffier, gives New York's underground gambling scene a vivid atmopshere, with special attention to its particular rituals and fast macho talk.John Dahl's film is not as sinister or complex as its cinematic cousin, House of Games, but it is fun to see these young Hollywood studs (Damon, Edward Norton, Gretchen Mol) strut their stuff.Although featuring a splendid Edward Norton performance, 'Rounders' comes across as too unbelievable, often straying beyond the bounds of rationality.John Dahl creates an intelligent and character-driven crime-drama built around solid performances by Damon and Norton.The wholesome pup's poker face alone, however, hardly accounts for the film's failure to thrill. Damon's character doesn't really have that much stake in the story's outcome.Interesting but uneven.After you get over Malkovich's Oreo-eating, lisping Russian Mafia guy and John Turturro's work-a-day mug, Rounders leaves a smarmy hand on the table.Rounders has little trouble maintaining our interest, it's just that the stakes are disappointingly meager.The glimpse into an exotic, edgy world is absorbing and the performances of Damon, Norton and Landau are rewarding, despite the shaky credibility of their characters' relationships.Not a full house by any means....flat on substance, poor on relationships, big on predictability, and slow getting anywhere.A disappointing mediocrity.Norton's acting and Dahl's gift for sustaining a tone save Rounders from completely floundering.It's a movie of character and milieu, both of which it evokes brilliantly.A great cast, terrific screenplay and a director with a muscular sense of atmosphere and film mechanics help make the card-shark character-drama 'Rounders' a winner.The acting is crisp, and Dahl knows how to pace a movie and make it look good.This film tries to be The Hustler and ends up being The Color of Money, unfortunately.Worthwhile entertainment.Seductively savvy [and] suspense-filled.This film is never more exciting and engrossing when characters are engaging in a tough game of poker, with the stakes reaching as high as they can possibly go, smoke teeming from everywhere, and cool jazz music underscoring everything.A sure bet!It's still a smart and interesting picture.Rounders has its strengths, to be sure, but for all its polish it never manages to strike the heart.Rounders is less about how the cards are dealt than how people deal with the situations the cards create, and will hook you from beginning to end.Rounders is another nice notch in Damon's belt and an excellent commercial for Oreos, but its destiny lies as a dust collector on the video store shelves.In fighting to show the psychological complexities in Mike that the script ignores, Damon plays it like a rounder instead of a grinder. This kid still has surprises up his sleeve.The struggles of a young man to find his true calling.O filme possui o m\u00e9rito de n\u0103o tentar justificar a moral de seus personagens.This is an intelligent, absorbing movie that really pulled me in.Though Damon is an actor who's flatly impossible not to root for, the longer this film lasts the less patience we have to stay with him.It's rare that a movie lacking so much in logic and characterization is such fun to watch.Rounders cheerfully buys into compulsive gambling!This tale shows us a different world entirely -- the world of card-player as tortured artist.Though it's a good-looking flick with some smart acting and a few flashy runs, it barely breaks even dramatically, and feels, overall, like a good chance wasted.This is movie's tell, revealing that for all its cultivated effort by a brilliant cast and director, it's still dependent on antiquated screen gimmicks.According to director John Dahl's Rounders, professional poker players are very, very interesting people -- for about five minutes.Damon plays with stacked deck!No big deal!As for the cast, Damon is as personable as always. But it's really Norton, with his weaselly yet still likable turn, and both Landau and John Turturro (in too-brief supporting roles), who bring the film to life.A promising cast can't rescue a script without surprises!",

        "document": "Fanning and Russell make this watchable family entertainment, if not necessarily at today's prices.Please don't shoot the horse with the broken leg, Daddy, Dakota Fanning with her enormous eyes brimming with tears... doesn't exactly say, but she might as well have.Yes, Dreamer follows a formula, but the formula, when applied with skill and intelligence, as it is here, is pretty much foolproof.Crosses the finish line quite a few furlongs behind such classics of the girl-and-her horse genre as National Velvet, Black Stallion or Gypsy Colt.Dreamer: Still Better than SeabiscuitA sweet, solidly constructed family film, Dreamer may be short on surprises, but it has enough heart for ten movies.a chance to see America's little sweetheart, Dakota Fanning, before she turns 16, dyes her blonde hair jet black, and pierces something that shouldn't be piercedThe inspiration comes in spades thanks to solid work from two leads who could sell corn back to the Field of Dreams. Plus, who doesn't love horseys?Still manages to rouse spirits, in spite of everything.I have seen enough movies to know that 'wholesome' does not have to equate to 'unoriginal.' Yet there's not an inventive moment in the entire film.As simple and pretty as a Shaker rocker, Dreamer keeps getting better as it develops its theme about whether it's more important to have dreams or to achieve them.Sure, it's as goopy as Kris Kristofferson is grizzled, but families might find a genuinely warm experience in the simple story of a child following her heart %u2014 especially in the rare moments when we're not told how to feel.A quiet and poignant story.The charismatic Fanning proves she is the best child actress in decades.Screenwriting manuals have taught us that every film is (or should be) a Hero's Journey, but writer-director John Gatins takes that gospel so literally it's hard to know whether to admire his purity or marvel at his lack of imagination.simply feels more professional than most family fareIt is a movie that will captivate children, yes, but it will also capture the hearts of the grown-ups, too.Dreamer is loaded with enough clich\u00e9s and formulas to choke a horse. But truly, it works.All the characters are familiar, the story is familiar, but it is well-constructed and the actors do a good job with the material.Painfully earnest and aggressively sappy, it requires an outrageous suspension of disbelief, and becomes even more far-fetched as it goes along.This is a slow track of wish-fullfillment fantasy and all who come through the turnstiles will wear a happy face.Will entertain its target audience with ease. A wonderfully pleasing family safe film.As yet another underdog/family flick that tugs mercilessly at our heart strings, it just doesn't offer anything new and exciting in this well-worn genre.Solid work by Kurt Russell, Dakota Fanning, Kris Kristofferson and the equally sincere Elisabeth Shue can't win the race against a lame script.Dreamer doesn't try anything new, but has been assembled skillfully and seldom turns corny or silly.It's the performances ... that help elevate Dreamer from merely credible to inspiring.Yeah, it's sappy, but we're buying it.Let the Seabiscuit comparisons begin.Although John Gatins' screenplay is heavy with cliches and stale dialogue, Fanning plays every moment -- comic or tragic -- with perfect pitch.It was incredibly predictable. The characters were cut right out of a template. All the so-called surprises were telegraphed. But I liked it. This time, the formula worked.Most people enjoy a sweet, wholesome movie with an inspiring story; Dreamer is a reminder that those people need not be suckers.A sample of wholesome family entertainment that makes this critic thank God for David Lynch.Has a clich\u00e9 around every turn, but it takes forever to make the turns, lumbering along like an old nag.The plot may be predictable, but 'Dreamer' is utterly irresisitible and definitely worth seeing.The forced family dynamics just drag the movie down.A miasma of mixed messages and exhausted clich\u00e9s shot like a retirement home commercial and scored with an anvil.Dreamer moves slowly and noncommittally, like an ice cream sundae laced with Zoloft.Gatins pushes his way through emotionally manipulative material, but the performances are so appealing that it's easy to abandon cynicism.Watch a beautiful horse serve as a miracle worker for a dysfunctional family devoid of hope.try to fall asleep quickly -- the true story of your very own dreaming is bound to be an improvement over what's on-screen.A case study in how an unrepentant formula picture can be made to seem like it has nothing to be sorry about.An ordinary movie about a girl and her horse, but Dakota Fanning makes the difference.For fleeting moments, this movie about a little girl and her horse becomes one that fathers will know best.A nice film for a father to take his daughter to. Others may find it so by-the-numbers that even high-powered actors (+ a horse) have a hard time breathing life into it.Dakota Fanning, the busiest child actor on the planet it seems, brings her usual maturity to this fine family film. The horse is pretty good too.\"Seabiscuit\" it ain't, but \"Dreamer: Inspired by a True Story\" is one of those harmless horse movies that will entertain the kids.It manages to be a watchable, even enjoyable movie about and for girls, and in our world of candy-coated sparkly pink crap, that's a rare and commendable thing.In short, Dreamer may be shot through with cliches but they're good ones and, more importantly, they work. This is feel-good family entertainment of the first order and if you loved Seabiscuit, you'll love this too.Ah. Here's the family film we've been dreaming of all year long.Mildly pleasant, but never once does it surprise us.Its problems aren't its claims to truth so much as its letdowns to genre.It's precisely what we expect -- no more, no less -- and in that capacity, it is supremely successful.Though generally a formulaic girl-and-her-horse movie, the picture stands out from others of its ilk thanks to a remarkable performance by Dakota Fanning.Save for Dakota Fanning (who is marvelous no matter the role), there isn't a whole lot to enjoy or get involved in.When she speaks about her horse, Fanning can make you believe that no moment like that ever happened before, on or off screen. Now that is breeding.It shows what can be done with overworked and potentially sentimental livestock fodder when everything about the production is first-rate.The predictability of Dreamer makes it more likely to please those predisposed to the story line than to win any new fans to the equine romance genre.The low-key charm of its setting underscores the easygoing performances of a relaxed, well-matched cast.We've seen it all before, but this one is so well made and attractively cast it's a sure crowd pleaser.Some movies about horses take us for exhilarating rides, but Dreamer circles a well-worn trail again and again and doesn't know when to head for the barn.Pure corn--and though Gatins and his cast serve it up as slickly as one could ask, it still comes across as more than a little stale.The best girl-and-horse movie since National Velvet. Who's to say that Dakota Fanning won't have the career longevity of Elizabeth Taylor?As a sports drama -- a genre that's gotten entirely too much play lately -- Dreamer is singularly unexciting.A family film that even adults may enjoy.The film's route to the familiar ending is appealing, largely because Russell and Fanning create such winning father-daughter chemistry, and the theme reverberates with undeniably rousing good spirits.It trampled the curmudgeon right out of me.It's to Fanning's and Russell's credit, and the filmmakers', that the formula never gets the better of the film.There's nothing particularly inspired about the film.Too obvious, too trite and too sentimental to ever be more than Seabiscuit for tweens.Fanning and Russell are a perfect, sweet-and-sour pair. And, of course, the horse is absolutely beautiful -- which, in the end, is what this all comes down to, anyway.It makes a solid case that a wounded horse can heal a wounded family.Charming all-ages entertainment.Lovely family film, which has a way of resonating in one's imagination for days.Seabiscuit-Lite (half the emotional impact and half as satisfying as the regular inspiration film).For family audiences seeking easy assurance, moral certitude and, of course, moving scenes of a gorgeous, galloping horse.Triumphant coming-of-age drama (complete with horses!) [aimed] at little girls and their captive-audience fathers.Gallop, don't walk, to a movie house for one of the most uplifting live-action family films in years.A sugarcube of good intentions that works.The bond between Cale and Sonya changes everyone's lives, including the film's oddest convert, wealthy Prince Sadir (underused Oded Fehr).Despite thoroughbred work from Dakota Fanning, by the time the movie hits the final furlong it's only good for the glue factory.A great family film.High-spirited, sweetly satisfying, it's an inspirational, feel-good family film that's reminiscent of - but not as good as - \"Seabiscuit.\"Bland family fare that goes down easy but neither edifies nor challenges.It is Russell, the workhorse actor of Miracle and the recent Sky High, who gives Dreamer the needed leg up.It canters. It gallops. It clears fences of familiarity with grace. It stands two hands above most flicks bred for families, stirring pleasure at its fine-muscled gait.Has a no-nonsense, forward momentum that keeps it rocketing toward the gate.This family drama wants to do nothing more than tell a story that will make audiences feel good about themselves and about the world in general. Which makes it a refreshing change of pace.Like Seabiscuit, Dreamer is as much about people as horse racing. And that's why it succeeds.Closer to Seabiscuit than to Racing Stripes. For that, you can thank the entire cast of able underplayers, most notably Dakota Fanning.From the first twinkly notes of Americana on the soundtrack to the last freeze-frame voice-over, the movie offers exactly the gooey, homogenized confection it promises -- or almost exactly.Any girl (and a lot of boys) in the target age group are going to make Dreamer one of their favorite films.Modestly engaging but mostly unexceptional.This DreamWorks release recycles just about every sentimental ploy and cliche from a raft of horse racing movies....a well-acted chunk of Velveeta.It's a bit hokey, sure, but it's aimed at hopeful children, not middle-aged cynics.Not particularly inspired or necessarily true, but solid family (read: 7-12 year-olds] entertainment.Viewers will be encouraged to sleep, to dream of better movies.I wonder if the 'true story' Dreamer was 'inspired by' was the one where Seabiscuit made over 120 million dollars at the box-office in 2003?Surprisingly palatable.Despite the formulaic plot, Dreamer stays the course and emerges as a solid family drama that doesn't resort to preciousness.Dreamer does hoe some pretty familiar turf, but thankfully it doesn't husk too much corn.Absolutely solid family entertainment, Dreamer: Inspired by a True Story is corn-fed, wholesome and thoroughly satisfying.Most of what it lacks in originality, it compensates for in spirit, and its success is dependent on the commitment of the actors and the sense of family they evoke.The plot, 'inspired by a true story,' is all but impossible.Whatever its flaws, Dreamer is sure-footed, sure-fire family entertainment.Underdog animal story that comes by its emotions honestly and with few pretensions.A textbook study in cinematic recycling -- everything in it seems to have been borrowed from other movies.This is a lovely film; it's about a million times better than the other so-called children's or family movies out there.Gatins is so worshipful of a child's starry-eyed aspirations that he forgets to ground them in narrative honesty.Treads a well-worn path that will likely feel familiar even to the newest crop of horse-crazy girls.a beautifully made, well acted, old fashioned movie with humor, pathos, and a good premise, highlighted by terrific performances by Kurt Russell and Dakota Fanning.",

Yes, but I liked it too.I went in rooting for SATC with everything I had, and it left me a bit disappointed.Wouldn't it be redundant to describe the self-indulgent big-screen adaptation as similarly vapid, pointless, and poorly acted as the popular HBO show upon which it is based?The behemoth 145-minute running time for this lightweight romantic comedy is unforgivable, and that's only the first of this movie's problems.Reliving the fantasy lush life....'Yes,' she said. 'It's Star Trek for women.'...The movie Sex and the City is a heady female fantasy -- I think. I tried to snuggle up to Sex and the City, but the attempt to snuggle for two hours and 20 minutes is in itself a fantasy. Like many typical men, I'm afraid I fell asleep.As amigas de Sex and the City est\u0433o entre as criaturas da fic\u0437\u0433o mais repulsivas que j\u0431 conheci: f\u044ateis, est\u044apidas, ego\u043dstas e entediantes. Al\u0439m disso, isto n\u0433o \u0439 um filme, \u0439 um cat\u0431logo.Ono sto je u tridesetominutnoj epizodi moglo pro\u0107i kao vrckavi drustveni komentar u dva i pol sata se pretvorilo u praznu ljusturu.The ladies settle into the doldrums of marriage and their antics are reduced to a detached series of scenes that involve sulking, yearning or just plain indulging.Ultimately, it's this streak of realism that prevents Sex And The City from becoming just another fluffy New York fairytale.Sarah Jessica Parker's complex dance with love, marriage and Mr. Big provides the biggest notes in a symphony of wailing womanhood.... a gay camp parody of the way fabulous heterosexual women court affectionWhile he's let the movie run to excessive length, the well-practiced Parker King (throwing in more brand names than you will find in a Myers catalogue) knows what his target audience wanted from this reunion.The film is raw, sentimental and outrageously materialistic - just as a true fan would hope and expect it would be.The pacing barely ever breaks out of a light plod. And the writing is very, very average.I had to wonder what happened to the qualities that made the show famous: the outrageous dialogue, the sense of female camaraderie, the embrace of casual sex as a guiltless pleasure.When it neglects the fizz in favour of the grit (or at least the kind of grit acceptable for Sex And The City), this femme phenomenon hits the spot.This movie has generated record excitement in just about every woman of my acquaintance.I love Sarah Jessica Parker...Carrie and Mr. Big are definitely the best things about this film. But, at 2.5 hours long, there's just not enough good stuff to put this one over the top. I hate the sound of Kim Cattrall speaking, so that didn't help.Here is an unashamed celebration of materialist values, an orgy of labels, brands and product placements as sinful, by implication, as the behaviour of the characters.The four lead actresses are better than ever...costume designer Patricia Field, the 'fifth Beatle' as it were, has outdone herself.It's nice to see the girls again, but this \"City\" seems oddly smaller than it did when it ran on HBO. In the end, a more accurate title would have been \"Strife in the City.\" These women, after all, aren't having much sex.... a deeply satisfying wrap-up to a series that always had, in its heart of hearts, a lot more depth than the Manolo Blahniks it dressed itself up in.As someone who failed to appreciate the 'Sex and the City' TV series, I'm surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie celebration of friendship.To its voracious universe of cult-following fans, it feels like a TV marathon that spans an entire season. To everyone else who bats an indifferent eye, all the glam and glitz has something even for you to learn, too.An estrogen-fueled salute to the virtues of excess, if that's your Gucci bag.Though graced with far more sitcom laughs than real wit, the glorified soap opera is entertaining enough to be worth your while....after two and a half hours with these ladies, I've decided that I like them.Why get the band back together if you're not going to add some new songs to the greatest hits?I walked into the theatre hoping for a nice evening and came out as a hard-line Marxist, my head a whirl of closets, delusions, and blunt-clawed cattiness. All the film lacks is a subtitle: The Lying, the Bitch, and the Wardrobe.All we're left with is a movie that reminds us how good its source material once was and serves as a warning to anyone considering bringing a series to the big screen.The movie, scripted and directed by series veteran Michael Patrick King, caters to viewers nostalgic for the Emmy-winning show while pushing forward into feature film territory.What was slyly titillating in half-hour segments becomes silly, superficial and overwhemingly materialistic when stretched to nearly 2 1/2 hours. Bigger doesn't always mean better.Loaded with obvious product placement, the film should be called 'Sex and the City: The Catalog' instead of 'Sex and the City: The Movie.'Ultimately, Sex And The City serves as a glitter-laced love letter to its fans, which is really all it needs to be.It may have been four years since the HBO television series Sex and the City halted production of original episodes, but the characters and material are still not ready for their big-screen close-up.The movie's initially brisk pacing slackens when the girls spend a holiday in Mexico that's long enough for them to cycle through an entire resort-wear collection.In this film, the clothes and the city are characters as vital as the four leads, and they don't disappoint.Just as fun, sexy, and label heavy as the series.Sex and the City, which feels like a behind-numbing six episodes strung clumsily together, could be much fun in the hands of a veteran director.In both its TV and movie incarnations, the empty materialism and sincere longing for love always manage to cancel each other out, leaving behind nothing but what this started out as -- a sitcom.Flabby, unfocused reunion in which the emotional content is drowned out by the incessant pursuit and plugging of designer shoes, gowns and handbags.Sex and the City can't live up to the HBO series, but simply having the foursome together again will be more than enough for hardcore fans.An absurd joke.They're all over 40 now, and writer/director Michael Patrick King deftly balances their hard-won wisdom with the wistful dreams they still share. At the same time, there's plenty of fun to be had.We'll continue to experience befuddlement verging on disgust whenever we're reminded of Sex and the City (so named, we suppose, because Seriously Rethinking Third-Wave Feminism reads like ass on a poster).If you're a fan of the series, SATC will feel like a warm bath and a favorite meal with old friends. If you're not a fan, why in the name of Manolo Blahnik have you read this far?SATC offers well-developed characters, smart dialogue, interesting plots and sub-plots, and a ton of heart.A vision of which doesn't require its characters being frozen in amber after a fairy tale ending and allows life to go on, happily and unconventionally.More disappointment than joyful reunion, a tedious and desperately drawn-out affair that tests your patience even as it brazenly courts (and often earns) your contempt.For presold audiences only.Movin' on up to the movie big time means Sex and the City can no longer be accepted as just a cable-TV party game. It has to compete with the big girls, Hollywood's classic representations of female beauty, desire and strength. And it doesn't.The only empathy I felt was for the poor men that had to put up with these ridiculous girls.I am not the person to review this movie. Perhaps you will enjoy a review from someone who disqualifies himself at the outset, doesn't much like most of the characters and is bored by their bubble-brained conversations.Frothy as a Margarita and just as salty, Sex and the City all but mambos its way onto the screen.It was like attending a party where all the guests have known each other for years, exert no effort to make a newcomer feel at home and chatter endlessly -- yes, for two-and-a-half draggy hours -- about their romantic problems.Even fans may find themselves wondering when this very long episode will end.time ticks by easily like a lazy TV marathon, a humbler achievement than demanded by a diva flick that's as self-congratulatory as Indy across the multiplexIn short, Sex and the City the movie is everything Sex and the City the show ever was, as rambling and superficial as it is cunning and loveable.Yes, you will enjoy Sex and the City -- probably more so if you call things 'fabulous' and have more pairs of shoes than you have fingers.Having the story of Cinderella play a significant role in the feature introduces the deadpan irony that this version is told through the eyes of the stepsisters like a big screen version of Wicked only without the happy ending.If it all feels a mite perfunctory, a mite trite and a little dated (the girls haven't heard of the New Frugality?), Sex and the City still manages to be a hymn to hotness, hipness and haute couture, one its fans can happily sing along with.Sex and The City: The Movie is riddled with clich\u00e9s but the film works on a level that is smart, funny and just downright crude. Kim Cattrall, as Samantha, is the perfect balance to the series and the film.143 minutes of unbearably shallow characters, numerous extraneous plot threads in lieu of a central storyline and more product placements than in the \"Cannonball Run\" saga entire.It's like playing Barbies for grown-ups.I guess I can be most useful to this weekend's potential drag-alongs: it's not excruciating. I was never more than mildly annoyed.The fact of the matter is that this review doesn't matter.ridiculous and regressive.For those who'd like some substance in a movie pushing 2 1/2 hours, though, it's gratifying to report that this Sex is more than just a fan dance.Fans weaned on the stale, TBS version of the show will probably love it. Anyone expecting something remotely fresh is advised to look elsewhere.The show was at its best when it offered, without a great deal of extraneous examination, these glimpses into the nature of friendships between women. The movie needs more of that.It did about as much as I could hope for. It gives all four of its main characters plenty to do, it pays tribute to what's best about the series and it gives us another chance to spend time with people we thought we might never see again.Learning and hugging. There's lots of that here \u00e2\" woman to woman and man to woman \u00e2\" which satisfies the movie's fantasy fulfillment of both amity and eros.... feels like watching an entire season of shoe love, true love and everything in between -- all crammed into one loooooooooong sitting.It\u00e2(TM)s the fashion Olympics. Think of it that way, and what\u00e2(TM)s not to like?It's just that there's been an altitude adjustment -- fewer stilettos, more flats. Ask what women want of a chick flick and one answer may be this -- a pleasant reunion with cherished friends. Ask what women deserve and the answer is better.A girl can never have too many outfits, but a film can have too many scenes.Opt for the much better (and much shorter) version made in 1959 starring Hope Lange, Diane Baker, Suzy Parker and Joan Crawford.After staggering around a bit at the beginning it settles down and finds its groove. It's appropriately flashy, nicely naughty and wholly improbable, just as it's supposed to be.Fans rejoice: It's good. And smart. And funny.Judged by the standards of its original medium, the movie version succeeds just as well, cramming what used to take a whole season into a nearly 2 1/2 -hour marathon of men, misery and Manolos.Sex and the City: The Movie is no great shakes as a movie, but it doesn't have to be. What it does have to be is a happy revisit to a land its fans know well, and on that level it works very well.The movie is just like a half-season of the series -- a funny, sappy, clumsy, crude, rambunctious, argumentative, gleefully vulgar attempt to balance the fantasy of romance with the reality that the fantasy is impossible.A big, sloppy, gooey sundae of a film that is, for better or for worse, just like the show ... only longer.In its cinematic incarnation, Sex and the City has lost none of its bawdiness yet gained a more profound sense of soberness.From the running time to the plot development for each character, which grows to beating-a-dead-horse lengths in at least a couple of cases, the whole thing would have been better served by holding back a little.King fails to grasp what he once understood: When times are hard, you don't cry poverty. You step on the gas and give the audience a show.One of the movie's endearing qualities is its aversion to happily ever afters. In a way, it plays like the epilogue to your standard Hollywood romantic comedy.Cinerina invites her first guest reviewer, Melanie Treco. See full review for details.What does that say when a self-admitted narcissist receives such a following? In playing the victim card so often, Sarah Jessica Parker's character is one of the most unlikable characters I've seen in a long time.Was this bonbon to the show's fans, four years after the \"happily ever after\" series finale, really necessary?Plays like nothing more than a marathon viewing of an entire seventh season that should have never been made.To its credit, though, the movie turns Carrie's value system, which equates \"the two Ls--Labels and Love,\" to its advantage, and in the second half the movie achieves a nice balance between comedy and drama.It's too bad that the false sense of high heel empowerment never registers as soundly as our resident money-styling maidens look to achieve in this beleaguered City.Sex and the City is not a painful experience for men (or even guys), just a predictable one...Somewhere along the line, the movie version of Sex and the City got too much Botox injected into the script, and all the life was ironed out of it.It's nice to see these women again, because they are all rich and complex characters, but it's basically a sentimental exercise, designed for maximum cash flow before the idea is retired.I spent most of the film's 148 minutes just wanting to slap these women because I grew weary of their whining.Sex and the City: The Movie,/i> is the cherry on top of the series, and a fitting way to say a final good-bye to Carrie, Miranda, Samantha, Charlotte, and all their men.Hudson comes through so that you may remember her even when the popcorn is gone. If only the film itself did as well.Fans of Sex and the City will love the movie version.Carrie and Company Deliver the Same Old Song and DanceKing's attempt at \"racial balance\" pathetically backfires but at least proves useful in putting the show's inherently materialistic and supremacist ethos into sharper focus.If you don't love to watch fashion shows and Vogue photoshoots and designer wedding planning, \"Sex and the City\" and its consumer-driven fantasy world may elicit little more than yawns.Enjoyable big-screen sequel to the much-loved TV show that won't disappoint fans, thanks to strong performances and a script that is both moving and laugh-out-loud funny.Essentially there are four complete rom-coms here, which will delight series fans. And probably no one else.This movie provides no good reasons to revisit Sex and the City, except to fulfill fans' desires for one more for the road and add millions to Time Warner's coffers. Be careful what you wish for.For those who do not consider themselves to be among the Sex and the City faithful, this is a painful experience, perhaps the longest 148 minutes likely to be spent in a movie theater this year. Watching grass grow is more dramatically satisfying.King whips up enough quips and emotional moments to treat the faithful to a sort of moviegoing spa.A lot different from, say, watching several SATC episodes on DVD in succession as if gobbling fudge brownies. That may be OK for the living room, but in a multiplex, you just want things to move along already.The fans will (designer) label \"Sex and the City\" a hit this weekend.Witty, effervescent and unexpectedly thoughtful, the big-screen iteration of the HBO series stands up beautifully (and somewhat miraculously) to the twin pressures of popular expectation and critical assessment.A movie that taps directly back into the show's primal appeal, which is the sweet, sad, saucy delight of sharing these women's company.Beyond the shoes, the cosmopolitans and the disloyal men, Sex and the City has always been about the bond among women. At its best, the movie shows why that bond sticks.If you loved Sex as a TV show, you'll want to check out the film because it's like attending a class reunion. It's a chance to catch up with people who meant a lot to us.Devotees of the HBO series will probably flock to the movie...but anybody who's not already a fan is going to have difficulty understanding what all the fuss is about.Amid the style, sass and sexiness is plenty of sentimentality, especially at the satisfying conclusion.Bottom line the movie fails Movie Plot 101 by trying too hard. Too hard to appease its fans, too hard to color within the lines and too hard to prove that love conquers all.It's a pity that King didn't take more of a chance with his fanatically devoted audience and give them something they may not have quite expected or even really wanted.New York is fabulous, the clothes are fabulous and the shoes are beyond fabulous --- what more can a 'Sex and the City' devotee ask for? A sequel?There are flashes of graphic nudity and the usual salty language. But we fans wouldn't have it any other way.Sex and the City, the movie, feels like a glorified television episode in the best possible sense - utterly unchanged in spirit from its small screen roots yet just ambitious enough to validate its big screen adaptation....it's like being trapped in a dentist's office with nothing to read but an old issue of Vogue.There is something depressingly stunted about this movie; something desperate too.I hate, loathe and despise -- sorry to mince my words -- the movie based on the TV show.It's not a fashion romp. It has a strong emotional texture. The SATC women are still making bad choices.It's all really soapy, though, with only some smidgens of substance.I know this was made for the fans, but geez, was there no attempt to make it a good film?Sex and the City: The Motion Picture (not the actual title) is a joyful wallow. And it's more: In this summer of do-overs (The Incredible Hulk, a new Batman versus a new Joker), it's what the series finale should have been.It has more than enough sass, style and sentiment to keep the faithful satisfied. Add a star if you're a fan.You wouldn't spend valuable real-life time hanging out with self-absorbed idiots like this, so why on Earth would you watch a TV show (or a movie) about them?...so unexpectedly excellent.Some will be disappointed that it wasn't more adventurous. Some will love it because it is familiar. Some will wonder why all their friends are watching this crap.Sarah Jessica Parker is the pivot for this fabulous, fun frolic in which laughter and tears are shared through thick and thin, but always with glamour and style.Won't be redefining cinema as we know it, nor does it ever fully justify its existence as a feature film, but if you're a fan of the show, you probably won't care.... as comfortable and as decadent as sitting on the sofa with a big bowl of chocolate chip cookie dough.There were a lot of very funny moments in this film. I almost cried.If Sex and the City is a hit, it will be partly because it's an enjoyable and somewhat true depiction of female friendship. But grown women will also go to see it because, finally, someone made a movie for them.The end product is a case of bigger not necessarily being better.It is overly heavy -- at least an hour-and-a-half of its two-and-a-half-hour running time is spent with its heroine in abject heartbreak and depression, and that's when her friends aren't experiencing same.Writer/director Michael Patrick King's first attempt to slip into full-length features from television wears heavily, resulting in as poor a fit as Carrie sporting coveralls and clogs.Since it clocks in at almost 2 1/2 hours, you may think, sight unseen, that the movie version of the HBO smash Sex and the City is guilty of wretched excess. Pathetic excess is more like it.As gender-segregated experiences go, SATC is preferable to, say, that idiotic beefcake epic 300. The amusing thing about SATC is that it objectifies men in much the same way that most male-oriented movies objectify women.Isn't it encouraging to see that a big summer flick can be tethered to something other than a sweaty male action hero?The film is by no means a masterpiece, but it's a worthy exercise in indulgence that won't disappoint the cosmo-swilling core audience. And fans won't need to swill any cosmos to enjoy it.Bottom line: a provocative, groundbreaking TV series that worked in 30-minute segments has been bloated and padded into nearly two and a half hours of tedium and gratuitous product placement for everything from Vuitton to a new Mercedes-Benz GLK.fans will be thrilled to catch up with the gals. Non-fans will probably be a bit confused and wonder what all the fuss was about.One thing's for sure: fans of the series will lap this film up.Yes, it's good to see the Fab Four together again--you just wish they were in a funnier and wittier film than this indulgent and essentially middlebrow saga that feels like six TV episodes glued together, with a running time of two and a half hours!For a series so steeped in romance, the eagerly awaited Sex and the City movie feels a trifle half-hearted.The movie contains story lines strong enough to entertain both men and womenThis celebration with Carrie & Co. \u2014 very much television writ large \u2014 seems precisely the Sex and the City reunion the show's fans had hoped for.That neurotic clotheshorse and her somewhat liberated lusty ladies in waiting, steal the small screen show in their big screen debut, despite wearing their SATC sentimental and bubble-headed surface appeal like a badge of honor.I will be up front about this. The movie was not made for me, so I found it pretty insignificant. But it's also quite painless.Shock hit me several times while watching the movie, and never in a good way.the pithy premise becomes just so much sub-par chick-litI'm just not that into it.Sex and the City never feels like a cash-in. Instead, it plays more like a labor of love for everyone involved.As the movie drifts into its third hour, you start to feel that it's not joy that's keeping you in the theater. It's duty.As for the fanboys, they really should do something more beneficial to humankind than attacking female-centric films every chance they get -- ever hear of that proverbial long walk off a short pier?",

        "document": "Somewhere around the 45-minute mark the film transforms from cool-and-atmospheric thriller to indecipherable mess.Madly over-plotted, with overlapping time frames and puzzling sub-plots, it makes no concessions to neophytes.Day Watch deploys head-spinning cinematography and cool special effects. It's a trippy affair, even if it's just about impossible to track.all at once a complex morality tale, a dark mirror of post-Soviet Russia, and a masterpiece of dynamic surrealism, displaying some of the most imaginative visual effects yet seen in a feature-length movie.It relates to Night Watch the way X2 relates to X-Men: you need to have seen the earlier film to have a hope of following the plot, but it's a bigger, deeper, more exhilarating ride.Visually inventive and bleakly witty, this is a must for fans of off-kilter fantasy thrillers.Wearying and hard to follow at times, sure, but fun.Where Night Watch felt visceral and immediate, Day Watch feels cerebral and dismissive. Retains the first film's gorgeous and arresting visual style and ejects all the good story stuff.[Director] Bekmambetov succeeds in crafting a movie so fast-paced and stylish that it doesn't matter why there's a battle sequence or car chase, you just sit back and enjoy the ride.The ultimate downfall of the series is that it steadfastly refuses to define its own rules.... a mindless muddle - loud, slowly paced, and overdone; in other words, it is exactly like a bad Hollywood blockbuster, except for the subtitles.Although more flashily assembled, pic's relentless onslaught charms less over a running time almost 25 minutes longer.Day watch is nonsense. But it's glorious nonsense.While it's not as good as the first film, Day Watch is a nice alternative to the American horror flicks that have been polluting the cinemas this year.Narrative incoherence continues to reign supreme.Visually, it mixes a gritty reality with eye-popping horror-fantasy, but the story short-circuits the film by adding a level of incomprehensibility, particularly in its second half.Let's hope the humor is intentional; it's frankly hard to tell.Watch's supernatural police and Bekmambetov's rich visual palette give the film enough strength at least to throw a couple elbows to set itself apart from other nameless films with plenty of effects, but little vision.There's a lot more to make your eyes goggle, too, as the Watches chase each other up, down and under the streets of Moskva.mporei to epiko toy pragmatos na einai telika perissotero sto kefali ton synteleston opos kai i idea oti kanoyn kati megalytero apo holigoyntiano mplokmpaster, alla pantoy diakrineis ayti tin periergi slabiki ithiki kai se arketes periptoseis tin ieri treA must-see for fans of the original, but a shorter running time and less energetic CGI excess might have done this flawed horror fantasy a serious favour.A disappointing follow-up to Timur Bekmambetov's ground-cracking debut that still holds just enough explosiveness to blow a few fuses in your brain. Watch for the set-pieces (killer balls, car chases, power lines used as whips) and ignore the rest.Big, stupid and nonsensicalA slog through endless death metal-powered action sequences.Day Watch combines the action sequences of a John Woo blockbuster with wonderfully self-conscious humour and hardcore human interest.Even during its action sequences it is slow, confusing and apparently interminable.As ornate as a high class Russian samovar, Day Watch continues the battle between Light and Dark in Timur Bekmambetov's unmistakable high octane fashion.Impressively directed with superb special effects, this is an action-packed fantasy flick that's actually more fun than the first film.The film undeniably has buckets of style, aided and abetted by some extremely funky animated subtitles.Part zombie, part vampire and all a pain in the neck.Day Watch, like Night Watch, doesn't take itself seriously, one of its chief charms.However innovative and arresting the filmmaking, interest in this chapter begins to wane at the 105-minute mark.Aside from one stunning image of a sports car skidding along the face of a curved high-rise hotel, Night Watch fails to even equal its forebear's handful of flashy CG moments.A marked improvement over the original, it further proves Bekmambetov's abilities as a visionary filmmaker, though he sometimes loses sight of storytelling in favor of impressive action sequences and amusing sidetracks.The worst thing Bekmambetov has picked up from his American models is the tendency of megasequels to aggrandize material grown enervated, to compensate for thinness by spreading out.The picture is still a Russian-centric blob of overcooked genre pie filling, aiming high but barely able to keep up with itself; yet, Day Watch is a step in the right directionDazzles and confuses with equal determination.An oddly sweet-tempered mix of hyperbole, understatement and profoundly Slavic philosophizing about guilt, freedom and responsibility.With what seems to be a freer hand and a bigger budget, Bekmambetov returns with an even slicker, faster-paced and funnier take on the black magical sub-castes born in the novels of Sergei Lukyanenko and Vladimir Vasiliev.The first film ... had style and a specifically Russian streak of dark angst. Day Watch continues in that tradition but adds one unexpected element -- a weird sense of humor.Chalk of Fate? I'll refrain from the nails-on-a-chalkboard references when it comes to Day Watch - not because I can resist whacky wordplay, but because the movie was so monotones to me, I couldn't muster an actual cringe.Bekmambetov mostly keeps his story moving forward on the back of his immensely likable protagonist, played by Konstantin Khabensky.If you don't take it seriously -- i.e., if you're able to laugh at the notion of a piece of chalk that undoes time -- the sequel is a minor wackjob head trip.Bekmambetov and his crafty cinematographer Sergei Trofimov have so many different tricks that you'll be smiling at the scenes that make no sense.The story could easily bog down in its mix of cumulative incident and complicated interpersonal drama. But with Bekmambetov at the helm, it's a high-energy blast.There are many stunning special effects, including a car chase up the side of a building, as well as the sort of wild animated subtitles that turned up in Night Watch.Night Watch was a deliriously stylish and endlessly inventive rollercoaster ride; Day Watch adds emotional resonance to the mix to create an epic that's got more energy and depth than all three Lord of the Rings movies combined.Day Watch sports a fast and exciting surface, but none of it makes a lick of sense.The cinematic equivalent of a bludgeon that wallops you into a sort of mindless stupor with its brazenly stupid plot and chintzy visual pyrotechnics.This sequel reprises the original's conceit that if you just throw a lot of cool fantasy ballyhoo together, who cares if coherence becomes collateral damage? [This] is what you'd imagine it's like being stuck inside the head of a geeky 12-year-old boy.Day Watch could have been shorter and simpler, but the same might be said for any of the current Hollywood blockbusters -- none of which offer as many surprises.You don't need to have seen the original to pick up the user-friendly sequel. Take a deep breath after the intimidating opening montage and you'll be just fine.\"Daywatch\" looks huge -- Bekmambetov really knows how to marshal his limited resources. But the picture feels heavy; sitting through it is like swimming through lard.At an hour and 10 minutes... I was itching with boredom... Unfortunately, with the film's excruciating running time of two hours and 20 minutes, my ordeal had reached only the halfway point.Day Watch may not suit everyone, but it opens a big can of Russian whoop-de-whoop on anyone willing to take it.This sequel to the convoluted Night Watch offers more of the same.Were I to tell you the summer's most awesome blockbuster action sequel involved a war over a piece of chalk, you'd laugh. But it's true.To the credit of [director] Timur Bekmambetov, it is possible to dive into the second chapter of the ambitious, visually dazzling Russian fantasy trilogy that began with 2004's Night Watch without feeling completely adrift.It's exhausting just trying to imagine what 46-year-old director Timur Bekmambetov would do with Hollywood money. Yet, as puffed up as it is, Day Watch is redeemed by its sardonic, Slavic take on the end of the world.Day Watch is fast and furious and larded with bizarre laughs, and given its ending, we really can't wait to see what happens in Dusk Watch, the third installment.It's a playful, surrealistic antidote to standard genre entertainment.Its imagination is limited. The backstory is shallow and pat. Its characters are mostly one-note. And everything goes on much too long at 133 minutes.\"Day Watch\" is like a drone of cinematic House music for the eyes.Maybe they didn't invent the vampire movie. But thanks to Night Watch and now Day Watch, the Russians certainly have the last word in it.The filmmakers destroy Moscow with the same glee that Godzilla has in stomping Tokyo. Even though Day Watch is probably a good 20 minutes too long, it's easy to forgive its excesses because Bekmambetov just seems to be having so much fun.The pretentious plot aside, this is a highly stylized film that effortlessly blends brilliant imagery with heart-pounding action sequences.Answers the eternal question: The world will not end in fire or ice but by a yo-yo.Stylistically very different from anything we normally see in the United States. It's a lush film, bathed in an opulent darkness and dread. It has a Russian sensibility and embraces the character driven philosophy of European films.The series' theme might be that the center cannot hold, but the idea gets played out too literally, as Day Watch can barely keep an idea on the screen for a few minutes before whipping off in a new direction.It has fewer hallmarks of an epic, but it feels bigger, fuller -- a more complete work of fantasy.There's something to be said when the big reveal of a hiding place for a piece of chalk is more emotionally satisfying than the dramatization of a young boy turning towards evil.In comparison [to Night Watch], Day Watch is straightforward, explaining what's gone before while telling a fantastical story and having fun doing it.Daywatch has the fingerprints of Hollywood miscalculation.One hell of a movie.Day Watch is a bit like Vegas: a bunch of crazy, gaudy stuff that all fits together surprisingly well.Blurs the distinction between the pretentious and the profound. Still, the illusion is a viscerally compelling one and begs the question of how Bekmambetov will ever top himself.Surprisingly, Day Watch ups the ante with preposterously entertaining plot lines and fewer mind blowing effects [than the first].Spectaculars don't come much more bombastic than this goth-Russian supernatural epic.Every bit as puzzling as its predecessor, but it's shot in such a bold, crazy way that you have to admire its pure audacity.At 2 hours and 20 minutes, this zippy follow-up to Night Watch delivers a killer pace, blasts of heavy-metal, vexed characters, and gory allegory wherein occult terrorists suck blood, cast spells and escape to a spooky zone known as the Gloom.It's more action-oriented and has a lot more welcome humor [than the first]....nearly gave me a seizure (and movie-wise, I don't seizure lightly).Day Watch falls prey to the curse of most sequels in which 'more' is often a thin concept stretched beyond its limits and misconstrued to mean 'bigger and better.'It delivers more cutting-edge eye candy but defies any attempt at understanding.A noisy, incoherent, droning spectacle.[Director] Bekmambetov is a reckless and juvenile storyteller with a regrettable knack for empty spectacle.stylish but outrageously foolishJust another high concept/low content entry into the blockbuster market.Chockablock with neat ideas - so many, in fact, that they ultimately end up crowding each other out ... goofy, monumental fun, until it sort of isn't.Mixing history, sword & sorcery and science-fiction, Day Watch is overstuffed with gimmicks, making it a noisy but nifty-looking mess. Although wall-to-wall action, only a few sequences -- such as the climactic hotel showdown between the forces of Light aA perfect example of a filmmaking rule that seems to be true no matter what the country of origin - sequels are always bigger, louder, and crazier than the first one.A mish-mash of the worst traits of Boll, Luc Besson and all the fears promised of the Cold War.Even though I never quite understood the film, I at least had the sense that there's something to it, and it's worth my effort to eventually figure it out.",

        "document": "[Kidman's Mrs. Coulter is] a movie villain worth remembering -- in fact, if she were any more evil, she would have to change her name from Marisa to Ann.Like every other story that pits the Haves against the Have-Nots.In adapting Pullman's novel, Weitz jettisons its distinctive atmosphere and complex (and controversial) theological background and decides instead to whip through the plot....the cast is deadly serious, bringing each character to life and giving the audience a reason to cheer or boo them and their actions.The Golden Compass bears the brush strokes of a film produced by a committee of people intent on trying to make some money rather than a good movie.All the pieces combined feel like nothing more than a barrage of exquisitely crafted namesMy devotion to Jesus and love for my fellow man have been replaced with profound emptiness and contempt, and I have The Golden Compass to thank for it.Said Ridley Scott: 'We were contemplating talking animals in Blade Runner, but we wanted to hold off Sean Young's descent into madness at least until the end of principal shooting.'Come back, \"Eragon\"--all is forgiven!Patchy and strangely unengaging, The Golden Compass is impressive in scale but disappoints by its cluttered storytelling and lack of heart.The Golden Compass is an entertaining blend of feisty pre-teen girl heroine, CGI animals both adorable and fierce, and the usual suspects on the human side ...koyrastika amihani kai sygkehymeni kritiki sto thriskeytiko systima, den parehei oyte kata dianoia arketo allothi gia toys ano ton 16 na asholithoyn idiaitera me aytin tin yperparagogi, poy ehei aytapates megaleioy tin ora poy pashei sto rythmo kai ti synThis Compass points to the end of a would-be franchise.Lyra surpasses the timid drone of Pan's Labyrinth or the Pevensies' do-gooder sap, she's brave, smart, and the best liar in the universe.Deus ex machina ... is the only driving force.Suggesting at once Mrs. Coulter's devotion to her Magisterial mission, her fears of soulful and sensual embodiment, and yes, her own split self, her slap-and-hug of her damon all but stops the film's action.No, I didn't read the novel before seeing the film, and nothing in this shimmering disaster made me want to read it, either. Made me hate polar bears, and I used to love the darned things, so that's saying something.The Golden Compass should be fun, but it rarely is. It should sweep you away, but it rarely does. For a film suffused with magic, it is, regrettably, far from magical.A beautiful, thought-provoking fantasy film.Read this review, skip this movie, and instead read the excellent books. Poor Dakota Blue Fanning is the perfect Lyra in a terrible adaptation....the film possesses few attributes designed to draw in (and hold the interest of) neophytes.Those seeking a treatise on religion, or against religion, will have to look hard to find it in \"The Golden Compass,\" a convoluted but eye-catching fantasy.Unlike most fantasy aimed at younger audiences, there's a disturbing undercurrent at work here that imbues the film with a weightiness that's unusual in such works.Exciting and entertaining, although the complicated array of characters makes it sometimes hard-going.If you haven't read the books, it can be like wandering into a stuffy church service in a cathedral for the first time.For a film that supposedly promotes Atheism, at least it's more entertaining than last year's Christian allegory The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe.'The Golden Compass' concludes in a way that left me feeling teased and cheated.The Catholic League thinks it's anti-Catholic. Admirers of Philip Pullman's 1995 His Dark Materials trilogy think the film guts the backbone of the book. Me, I just think it blows.Wanting to appeal to a broad audience %u2014 especially young teens %u2014 is more than fine. It's admirable. But soulful, philosophical 13-year-olds do exist. They do! And they can even handle a religious discussion with lots of words involved.I heard the dialogue, I saw the images, but I never got into the story. I was always aware that I was sitting in a theater watching a movie.The Golden Compass isn't bad, it's cast is too good and it's too well made, but something fundamental to good storytelling - heart - has been lost, leaving a final product as icy and impossible to care for as Mrs. Coulter herself.Begets the less than ringing endorsement, 'Yeah, whatever. It was OK I suppose.'An engaging fantasy adventure that, albeit no masterpiece, is hardly the disaster one might have imagined.Excruciating papThis plot may sound somewhat ludicrous on paper, but Pullman has created a logical, well-thought-out world that Weitz has brilliantly translated to the big screen.I realize that when you make a book into a movie you cannot include every single detail, but it seems like Weitz purposely tried to take all of the magic out of the story....if I hadn't liked Pullman's books so much, I probably would have liked this movie version more than I did.This kid film noir touching on magic dust substance abuse, cranky clerics, worrisome wizards, goth grownup child abusers and computer-generated homicidal polar bear throat slashers, is less likely to dazzle the senses than exhaust minds of all ages.Sam Elliott shows up as a cowboy, who would normally be a pick-me-up, but with Golden Compass I just wanted to find my direction home.Will it be enough to satisfy fans of Philip Pullman's widely read 'His Dark Materials' trilogy? Hard to say. But for the uninitiated this is an engaging adventure, even when Chris Weitz's screenplay lacks the compelling clarity of Pullman's prose.",

        "document": "A very funny movie that is able to combine a great premise with ideal actors, laugh out scenes with a sentimental touch and over the top sequences with a believable story line.A crisply paced romp featuring pitch-perfect performances by adversarial leads Robert De Niro and Ben Stiller.A comedy that has likeable, human characters as well as consistent laughs.Watching Ben get the girl or be seriously injured trying always has its dry, keening pleasures.I can't remember when I last laughed so hard during a film. DeNiro and Stiller are a perfect match and I walked out of the theater wanting to see more of these characters.Quite simply, this Focker has us laughing out loud frequently and abundantly.Robert De Niro and Ben Stiller give the comedy of disaster a nice little workout.The real comic bite comes from the combustible energy between the two lead actors.It's warm and humorous and avoids being mean-spirited, which alone makes it special.This fall's pleasant surprise.High concept that aims for the middle and meets its mark emphatically and satisfyingly.The film is uproarious without ever becoming nasty or mean-spirited.Passable movie entertainment, but like most future in-laws leaves a feeling of something still desired.With near-Swiss precision, director/producer Jay Roach ... and his writers make sure familiarity breeds hilarity.This is one hell of a funny movie, folks.De Niro delivers.Wonderfully funny.Whenever the movie is about to go wrong, something happens to set it right -- usually instigated by the coldly mean De Niro or the hot, nervous Stiller.I had a good time at Meet the Parents, even though the ratio of clinkers to yucks is disproportionately high.I literally found myself gasping for breath during Meet the Parents' most comic moments, wishing I could rewind the film.De Niro, once again proving that he understands comedy as well as urban psychoses.Roach ... knows to play to the movie's twin strengths: Stiller and De Niro.The gross-out factor is surprisingly low, and the combination of Stiller and De Niro is inspired: No father could be more formidable, no prospective son-in-law better equipped to squirm.Once again, Roach smokes. Meet the Parents is an extremely pleasant surprise, a high-concept romantic comedy that actually works.I didn't laugh so often as many of the people sitting around me at Meet the Parents, but I laughed enough to think: Yep, not bad.Great fun.With Meet the Parents, mainstream Hollywood reclaims one of its former strengths. It proves that it still knows how to provide audiences with a good time.Jay Roach, best known for the broad farce of the Austin Powers films, shows an unexpected flair for directing character comedy.Unlike most family squabbles, you'll find this one an amusing diversion.Possibly the most amusing mainstream live-action comedy since There's Something About Mary.Stiller portrays a human accident better than anyone and he definitely knows how to extort laughs and sympathy from his audienceDirector Jay Roach of the Austin Powers films keeps the pace brisk, and the script by Jim Herzfeld and John Hamburg ably piles the pratfalls ludicrously high.What gives the film its special kick is the match of Stiller and De Niro....large swaths of the proceedings feel as though they'd be more at home within a garden-variety sitcom.Star-driven comedy at times offensive and funny.Scenes that should have been uproarious are weaker than many of the movie's smaller moments, whose everyday humor isn't specific to the plot or characters.Owes about 55 percent of its charm to De Niro, who can be hilarious just sitting there.Packed with cringe-worthy moments from beginning to end, Jay Roach's comedy is for anyone who has ever endured a weekend in the company of potential in-laws.Alas, poor Focker. He can't help himself. And we can't help ourselves from falling about, equally helpless, at this superbly antic movie.Nobody plays put-upon quite like Ben Stiller.Guaranteed to put you off suggested Sunday outings for life.Stiller plays a familiar character with a nice energy and presence, making the most of all his character's asides and observations.As far as one-joke movies go, this one has its guffaws.Does the usual Hollywood bit of setting up the gags way in advance so that even a coma patient can spot them.The best American comedy of 2000. It has wit, slapstick and romance -- as well as an improbable comedy team in Robert De Niro and Ben StillerAn entertaining little outing, but not something that will stay with me.A definite must-see that's perfect for a guys' night out or a relaxing date.Never before have two such skilled actors been so monstrously squandered in a movie so replete with failed gags and pathetic gaffes.Astutely observed, subtly played and consistently hilarious...Contains enough belly-laughs and sly jokes to become one of the bigger crowd-pleasers of the fall.What saves the movie from remaining an exercise in self-parody for all involved is director Roach's feel for the material.This is, unquestionably, the best comedy currently on release. Highly recommended.This film is almost too real to be funny. It is one uncomfortable moment after another - and that is what Stiller does best, but director Roach would have done well to tone it down a bit.Stiller has a gift for looking funny effortlessly, when he's doing nothing physical. With no mugging, no physical contortions, he turns his face into a palette of pain and confusion.This simple but well-constructed comedy picks a situation that naturally causes anxiety - meeting your in-laws - and turns it into a walk through hell.I'm eagerly awaiting a sequel.Great filmmaking this is not, but if you're looking for an amusing, undemanding couple of hours, give this a try.Overbearingly cruel and only modestly funny.Too many actors make the error of thinking that being funny involves lots of hysteria and hyperactivity, but De Niro knows that good comic acting is no different than good dramatics: The performance must be grounded in truth.Consistently more fun than it has any right to be, Meet the Parents is an example of how sometimes it really is all about casting the right couple of stars.A five star hoot.The sight-gags and verbal repartee hinge upon uninspired, lowest-common-denominator hijinks.Meet the Parents generates most of its laughs in the give-and-take between Stiller and De Niro....highly amusing...at times leaves most of the men in the audience throwing their heads back and realizing exactly how realistic the situation at hand is.Es lamentable que el talento de DeNiro se est\u00e9 desperdiciando en cintas que no terminan de cuajar, por muy taquilleras que \u00e9stas seanA brilliant comedy in which we laugh that we do not cry -- although we do wince, as every expectation the main character has of things turning out okay crumbles and his face gets ever the redder.Deliciously funny and warmly poignant, it's a treat to Meet the Parents.Ben Stiller, an excellent comic actor, does some of his best work here, matched up with one of the all-time greats, Robert De Niro.None of the jokes are forced, which makes Meet the Parents a singular achievement.[Roach] does know how to stage discrete comic moments, taking mildly humorous nightmares and turning them into nicely wrought miniatures.Meet the Parents is a one- -- well, maybe two- -- joke idea that starts out goofy and fun, but soon runs out of verbal or visual ammunition.Never before have two such skilled actors been so monstrously squandered in a movie so replete with failed gags and pathetic gaffs.It's the prom night scene from There's Something About Mary stretched out over an entire movie - just not as funny.If ever there was a movie that felt like it was built backward, it's Meet the Parents.While it's a truism that all comedy has an element of sadism, it doesn't necessarily follow that all sadism is funny.More often than not, the movie's tension gets in the way of its giggles, falling back on its stars' comedy instincts and over-extended running gags.It never quite gets going.Plays like a thirty minute sitcom that overstays its welcome for more than an hour.There is an uneven mix of slapstick sequences and human comedy. Certainly the last part of the film feels awkwardly written.Ben Stiller is simply fantastic, and this DeNiro kid could be big someday.It was a well-acted, likable and benignly amusing film.A hilarious hodgepodge of The In-Laws and Annie Hall, in which De Niro gives his best comic performance to date.A non-stop riot headed up by the first rate pairing of Ben Stiller and Robert DeNiro.When the script puts its faith in the audience, allowing us to find the laughs on our own, the film is irresistible, a bright lark. Yet when the writers panic, upping the antic volume and shifting into crazed sitcom gear, the lark stops.This truth doesn't hurt as much as the infamous franks-and-beans scene from There's Something About Mary, but the pain and the laughter last longer.One of those cruel-yet-very-funny crowd pleasers.Solid, sadistic Stiller fare.Stiller, who is shaping up to be one of the most adept comic performers of our time, does a terrific job of building sympathy for the hapless outsider.A straightforward romantic comedy that doesn't take a lot of chances, but still manages to deliver the goods.Meet the Parents gets its best moments in the friction between De Niro and Stiller. Their screen personas -- the intimidator and the hapless smart guy -- are a perfect mismatch, and the spark between them ignite plenty of laughs.The jokes work, because they are so relentless and absurd.With current comedy obsessed with oh-so-clever ironic gestures and tricksy pastiche, Meet the Parents' dedication to consistent, straightforward belly laughs is totally refreshing.Meet the Parents builds brilliantly on interlocking comic situations.There is a sub-category of comedy ... in which we laugh at the hideously humiliating experiences of some poor sap. If this is your kind of humor, than this is your kind of movie.Meet the Parents doesn't sparkle like Vincente Minnelli's Father of the Bride. But with bubbly adult comedies at such a premium, it goes down like a flute of Champagne, leaving an aftertaste of giggles.Most of the humor here is pretty clever.Stiller is brilliant.A string of non-stop humor.Funny bits abound, overstuffed to the point of tearing at the seams, the film might have benefited from a bit more cutting.Even with Stiller and De Niro, Meet the Parents is an encounter that can be postponed until it's available on video.An unfathomably awful film that will undoubtedly be a smash hit.While it doesn't quite live up to its potential, it's still a heck of a lot funnier than what usually passes for comedy in these days.That the film works in spite of the people behind the camera says a lot for the people in front of the camera.It's laugh-out-loud funny.Follows a rather predictable, well-worn path, but the sheer joy of performing on the actors' parts sells the film as a whole.A hilarious comedy about the ridiculous lenghts a young man goes to in order to prove himself to his girlfriend's family.Stiller and De Niro play off well against each other, and neither goes too far off the deep end.With all due respect to giggles, though, you would do better to rent Raging Bull.Meet the Parents is much too herky-jerky to be completely successful, and it follows each laugh-out-loud scene with one that is completely -- or is at least a bit -- cringe-worthy.Very fun and very entertaining.An entertaining comic nightmare, but like most bad dreams, it disappears once the lights come up.Though Meet the Parents features a capable supporting cast, the laughs come almost exclusively from the tussle between Stiller and De Niro, and both deliver.I haven't laughed this hard since the trailer for Billy Elliot.If De Niro's mafia comedy Analyze This went for cheap laughs, Meet The Parents develops real depth.Meet the Parents might not be sophisticated comedy, but it's certainly enjoyable.Flat-out hilarious.DeNiro is the real pleasure to watch.In many ways reminiscent of There's Something About Mary.An adult-oriented comedy that, while hardly reserved, rests its very funny foundation on well-conceived characterization, lively dialogue and good acting.A comedy that works for the most part while in other sections has the audience waiting for a TV laugh track that doesn't come.Don't go to this movie if you've recently had hernia surgery, because the expression 'bust a gut laughing' might go beyond metaphor in your case.Uneven in tone, often trite and certainly neither De Niro nor Stiller's finest, Meet the Parents is nevertheless a funny and sometimes substantial movie.You feel you've seen it all before: There's Something About Mary did it funnier, and The Heartbreak Kid did it wiser. But when Stiller is let loose, you never feel that Charles Grodin did it drier.A clever situation-comedy that delivers quite a few laughs.Within its formulaic confines, the humor works uncommonly well from time to time.Meet the Parents is hysterical.A good-spirited comedy.Has all the elements for a memorable farce and succeeds more often than not.See it with someone you love -- and maybe with his or her parents.This isn't Ernst Lubitsch or anything, but the movie is consistently funny without the calculated gross-out moments that have been dominating mainstream comedy in recent years.If you can just accept the fact that real human behavior has been thrown out the window like the baby in Andy Warhol's Bad, then you'll have a really good time watching Stiller and De Niro square off.Meet the Parents has all the elements of either a bedroom farce or a Hardy Boys mystery. Turns out it's the former, and a mighty funny one at that.You couldn't do much better than to pit De Niro at his most humorlessly imposing against Ben Stiller at his most anxiously eager to please.A refreshing change from the current trend of gross and grosser humor.It never runs out of steam or ways of inflicting more ignominy on Stiller.It's funny. Really funny.Even better than There's Something About Mary.A very funny movie.There's hardly anything surprising about Meet the Parents, except that it's much funnier than you might expect.",

See her here, and you can say you remember the early days.Vera Farmiga gives an astonishing performance in this complex chronicle of a drug addict who goes through rehab, yearning for redemption, but her experience is not tidy and there's no neat conclusion.Conventional movies, even independent ones, tend to get histrionic and judgmental about such drug-related setbacks. But Granik's film, though hardly a clinical case study, keeps a measured distance from the heavy-handed or simplistic.Down to the Bone achieves what only the best independent films have: making life, at its most unvarnished, a journey.[A] small, beautifully faceted gem.For actress Vera Farmiga, Down to the Bone presents her with a breakout role.Granik brings to her drama a clear-eyed realism as she charts one woman's descent into a drug-fueled purgatory.... a stark, realistic portrait of a working-class mother in New York's depressed Ulster County as she tries to battle a drug habit.A quietly harrowing chronicle of addiction and fragile recovery anchored by Vera Farmiga's intense performance.if you've ever wondered why people in 12-step programs aren't supposed to sleep together right off the bat, well, this movie is about to show you, in detail.Strong performances from Vera Farmiga and Hugh Dillon keep things from becoming overdramatic.Farmiga effectively shows the fear, need and hope at war within Irene, how the false high of being clean for a week can fade when she realizes the second week isn't going to be any easier.The film is so pitch perfect and realistic, it seems you are there with these people, watching their lives unfold before you as it happens.If there were an ounce of taste left in Hollywood, the magnificent Vera Farmiga would be a front-runner for the Best Actress Oscar.The movie takes us down an unexpected path with riveting skill and a refreshing lack of easy answers.The movie boasts a fantastic performance by Vera Farmiga and an exceedingly unhappy storyline. It's a movie you \"appreciate\" more than you \"enjoy.\"This downbeat story of blue-collar drug abuse becomes a moving portrait of people battling their inner demons, thanks to an outstanding acting ensemble.The movie seems to be about drug addiction and recovery, but it gradually shifts, becoming a look from an unusual angle at what a big job it is to be a parent and the priorities it requires.",

        "document": "[Guiraudie] has given Stranger by the Lake a grandeur that goes beyond the anecdotal. You see it both in the expansiveness of the setting and in the faithfulness of a born filmmaker to the materials of cinema.The existential loneliness...and the evanescent nature of deeper human interaction in a world where sexual compulsion takes top priority are evoked with a powerfully dry yet keen observation that is heartbreaking.\"Stranger by the Lake\" is seductive and fascinating, but it is also a bit trapped in its own conceit, and in its carefully maintained emotional detachment.\"Stranger by the Lake\" is the sexiest and most elegant thriller in years, and it's a damn shame it stands so little chance of traveling beyond the niche of a \"gay film\" it will probably get squeezed into.Like his characters, [director Alain] Guiraudie is walking a tightrope, finding the point where sex and death exude a similar allure. You won't be able to look away.A psychosexually intriguing blend of Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window and William Friedkin's Cruising ...Though it'll be confined to the art house circuit, Stranger By the Lake actually has all the ingredients of a mainstream, page-turning summer beach read.Everything, from the sex to the relationships to the genre elements, is in a bothersome but no less captivating state of flux.A cautionary tale about finding love with an improper stranger.So much of this beguiling film's beauty is in how it sneaks up on you, the way genre elements quietly insinuate their way into the story.Guiraudie's film is acutely brilliant on the funny, scary machinery of desire, and how easily humans can get caught up in its cogwheels.Alain Guiraudie - remember that name.It shimmers with that intoxicating sun-on-the-water allure that might make someone not quite themselves.Alain Guiraudie's thriller is characterised both by its formal ingenuity and its surprisingly graphic gay sex. The plotting rekindles memories both of Patricia Highsmith novels and of Hitchcock films.As an exercise in style, this minimalist noir erotic thriller is pretty cool. But it loses its way somewhere around the midpoint and never quite finds it again.Like a wry scientist, wading through the jungle, Guiraudie notes every tiny, unwritten law. It's infectious stuff.Even though this dramatic thriller is set in a place most viewers will be unable to identify with, filmmaker Alain Guiraudie and his cast draw us in completely.When was the last time you saw an erotic thriller that worked simultaneously on both levels?A simple and ruthlessly effective exercise in minimal narrative and style, Alain Guiraudie's moral tale is so restrained and atmospheric that the nudity and graphic sex don't upstage the creepy mood of seductive, inescapable doom.I thought the film silly if endearing. Fluff noir. Others, peering into the crystal, see and prophesy a cult future for filmmaker Alain Guiraudie.Guiraudie's telling is fairly cold-blooded, but the choreographed dance of desire and disappointment still manages to intrigue.Hitchcock by way of Cruising.Beautifully crafted, sinister, frightening, erotic and thought-provoking, Alain Guiraudie's multi-faceted Cannes triumph is already one of the most provocative, intriguing films of the year.Desire, danger and death - Guiraudie uses the water's edge as a playground for hedonistic predators and willing prey.The motivations may be questionable, but desire has a way of clouding even the clearest heads.A gripping and superbly directed picture with something to say about the nature of infatuation and obsession.Oddly for such a suspenseful film, Stranger by the Lake is rather encouraging in its insistence on the different shapes that human connection can take.A sophisticated, unpredictable and original modern noir.Notable already for its depiction of real sex, it's explicit in other ways too: a depiction of amoral attraction that deserves a wider audience than mere fans of elegant congress.Sun, sex, psychosis, skinny-dipping: it sounds like genre tat, but Guiraudie's dark, droll study of a risky attraction upends expectations. It plays by stealth, but its sly grip is sure.Hitchcockian in the most lurid sense of the word.Hot and cold and provocative in more than just the expected ways, Stranger by the Lake presents even the most dishonest sex as an honest thrill.There are very real, very potent emotions underlying every action, be it an explicit sex act, a lingering embrace, or a horrible realization that meting out death does not necessarily preclude love.Confronting. Explicit. Eerie. Nightmarish. Its atmosphere lingers long in my memory, rolling over the haunting images and spectral sounds.Stranger By The Lake is a small, highly polished film detailing how easily morality can become unmoored, Lord of the Flies-style, in an enclosed society that refers only to itself.An erotic-drama-cum-murder-mystery - where the operative word is unquestionably 'cum'.A slow-building, meticulously crafted, engrossing thriller as provocative for its ideas about desire, transgression and narcissism as for its scenes of man-on-man coupling.Gratuitousness (some scenes are simply porn) overshadows the crux of the tale, namely Franck's libido taking precedence over his conscience and the risk that he may become an accomplice.Alain Guiraudie allows the chosen genre styles and structures to freely blend and merge. The transitions between thriller, comedy and romance are sometimes almost indiscernible.Unsettling, suspenseful and sad, it's a movie that sticks with you long after it's over.Sex, murder, and tension in a tranquil settingThere's too much metaphysical packaging material in the story; it's half Styrofoam peanuts. But its ideas are intriguing and its murky suspense is undeniable.Carefully and often brilliantly creates its own Eden-like universe.Claire Mathon's brilliant cinematography finds an appositely sinister glare in the shimmering water and sunny skies.What sets the engrossing \"Stranger by the Lake\" apart is that its excesses seem to point to a moral purpose beyond shock or entertainment value.This death trip homoerotic thriller, influenced by Hitchcock, is powerful, weird, and intoxicating - until its final scenes.However you read it, the film is compelling and audaciously candid in its erotic charge, while an ending that literally leaves us in the dark is one of the most haunting sign-offs in recent cinema.Stranger By The Lake is by turns a commentary on risk-taking, sex, death and the gay community wrapped up in an art-house thriller with comic notes.The writer-director's attention to the anarchic pull of lust, simultaneously celebrated and reproved here, is sharper than ever.The proximity between sex and death has rarely seemed as intimate as in Stranger by the Lake, the accomplished new film by gifted French director Alain Guiraudie.Writer/director Alain Guiraudie weaves a dark and intriguing tale of desire and menace in a moralistically ambiguous setting, a gay cruising ground.The film's circumscribed scope is simultaneously its most intriguing and most limiting factor.From a single setting, a lakeside gay cruising spot, and an old theme - the link between sex and death - Alain Guiraudie constructs an intricate film.A murderous love story whose serene setting hides a darker purpose.An absorbing and intelligent exploration of queer desire spiced up with thriller elements after one of the studly nudists goes missing.The movie is voyeuristic, sure, but in a way that evokes Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window more than William Friedkin's Cruising.This \"different\" and \"original\" minimalist drama (no music soundtrack, only one scene exhibited) is a meditation on passionate love and violent death among a small group of French homosexuals.A captivating, and enticing watch.You'll leave the cinema breathless, but sated.A career-best effort by French writer-director Alain Guiraudie.Darkly comic and ironic in true French style yet sexier and surprisingly compassionate. I was disappointed by the film's unresolved ending but it is well worthwhile until then. Prudish viewers, however should steer clear.Writer-director Alain Guiraudie gives the proceedings an almost clinical detachment, and consequently \"Stranger by the Lake\" has an air of Hitchcock to it.With its casual camera, simple story, unshaded areas of explaining desire, \"Stranger By the Lake\" is \"Knife in the Water\" without the woman. It doesn't dance about the dangling manhood, though. It shows it. Engorged, enraptured, enraged.There are things to be said about how director Alain Guiraudie creates something of a universe with these basic elements, and expertly builds up a fog of fear-induced erotic attraction/confusion.Never leaving the isolated location and with uneasy detail that doesn't distract from the main plot, Guiraudie's film eventually turns scary when a body washes up and a detective (J\u00e9r\u00f4me Chappatte) starts snooping around and asking probing questions.The film portrays cruising as a danger-seeking and astoundingly repetitive affair, intimately linked to death itself.Guiraudie's sheer frankness about sex is refreshing when so many supposedly grownup films are content to hint coyly and timidly.Classically constructed, as rigid in its construction of suspense as any recent thriller, Alain Guiraudie's \"Stranger by the Lake\" is a masterful work, uncluttered yet lush, formally mechanistic, yet always surprising.While its pace meanders, Stranger by the Lake proves to be an engrossing and darkly humorous watch.See past all the fumblings in the bushes, and writer-director Alain Guarardie's film reveals itself as a chilling psychological drama about the limits of desire, and the attractiveness of self-destruction.Understands desire as something ravenous, terrifying and ridiculous.Perfect, in that it achieves exactly what it meant to... portrays the world of casual sex and cruising with almost journalistic proficiency.While I found the characters interesting, the story was not very compelling and it was slow-moving as well. I learned a lot more about homosexual sex techniques than I wanted to know, and less about the characters than I wanted to know.The sexuality that builds tension early ends up being ultimately a distraction.Franck, so akin to Philip in Somerset Maugham's Of Human Bondage, knows in his heart that he is making a potentially deadly mistake, but his insatiable lust won't hear a word of it.A stunning minimalist erotic thriller that explores with arresting photography and economical use of dialogue how human identity is defined, and sometimes imprisoned, by our desires, drives, and passions.An extraordinarily atmospheric, unsettling film that raises mysteries that, in the end, remain insoluble.Movies must go somewhere, plots must always kick in, and when this one does, that's where \"Stranger by the Lake\" begins to contract into something less creative than its odd setting and compelling compositions would suggest.Guiraudie questions the limits of heedless sexual indulgence at the expense of all other considerations.Will reward film fans who have admired Claude Chabrol and the screen adaptations of Patricia Highsmith.This lake is a sexual refuge, about to be stained by sin and blood.Writer-director Alain Guiraudie has an imagistic talent for suspense and erotic byplay.The film submits a magnificent escalation of concern and characterization that supports the entire effort. The long road to a climatic payoff is well worth the wait.So studiously controlled that it's not an easy picture to watch, but you won't forget it.French filmmaker Alain Guiraudie's tantalizingly erotic fable of love, passion and death.The film is a Hitchcockian murder story in which the Hitchcockian elements-style as well as content-are stood on their heads in order to realize a philosophical vision that's no less sophisticated than Hitchcock's own.The kind of taut, low-key thriller that Roman Polanski and Alfred Hitchcock would very much admire.",

        "document": "Feels as average as an ordinary TV movie.Brick Lane feels slight and late to the table. Still, its pretty musings about small-scale self-actualization can be seductive.the director does not make her heroine's emotional maturation entirely believable, mainly because of the utter unredemptiveness with which Nazneen's husband is viewed until film's end.A poetic and sensitive drama about a Bangladesh village girl's life in England and her valiant struggle to stand on her own in the world with a full and grateful heartThe sort of female empowerment flick that could get a fatwa issued against Sarah Gavron, the intrepid director daring enough to make the pictureFewer incendiary incidents and a red pencil applied to the script might have freed the good movie that's buried somewhere beneath layers of unearned emotional conflict.Direction and the work of the cast are outstanding.Sarah Gavron's tale of a young Bangladeshi woman unwillingly transplanted to London's East End is absorbing enough, moving enough and visually attractive enough to provide a perfectly acceptable night out at the movies.No new ground is explored, however, in this handsomely constructed film. Nazneen's story seems familiar every step of the way.Sarah Gavron's Brick Lane, from a screenplay by Abi Morgan and Laura Jones, is based on the rapturously received 500-page first novel by Monica Ali.Brick Lane, by director Sarah Gavron and Angela's Ashes screenwriter Laura Jones, is, like Mira Nair's film The Namesake, a heartfelt portrait of the new immigrant experience.Relative newcomer Chatterjee is a revelation as Nazneen. It's her character's predicament that holds our interest.A blandly earnest coming-of-age story.Kaushik is remarkable as Chanu, a role that demands he be a buffoonish, yet loving man, intelligent beneath his self-aggrandizing attitudes, oversized ambitions and determined cheerfulness.Brick Lane is lovely to look at and the performances, particularly from Chatterjee and Kaushik, are delightful.A warm bath in comfortable platitudes.... an intriguing and visually interesting film that in aggregate never escapes the genre ghetto. It is another immigration song, a glancing curiosity that never really penetrates our preconceived romantic illusions.As long as Brick Lane remains focused on Nazneen, it succeeds admirably.In Chanu, it creates an indelible protagonist. He thinks he is a man of ideas. He is a man who, when it counts, is full of common sense and uncommon feeling.Despite the fine performances, Brick Lane comes across as a nice soap opera when it promised much more.The daily grind of a Brick Lane Bangladeshi is credibly brought to life in this sensitive and intelligent adaptation of Monica Ali's novel.It is, like all immigrant stories, about identity and Nazneen's journey is both painful and touching.Takes on the theme of 'Where is home'--the place where you were born or the locale of your residence--with freshness and sparkling acting.The director, Sarah Gavron, came through documentaries and BBC TV drama. This is her first feature and she makes the film very sensual, as well as highly controlled.Every conceivable choice on this film was met with the most obvious answer, and every turn comes right out of other movies.A movie whose visuals are lovely to behold and lyrically awash in sensuality and desire, but sets the lives of women back at least a few centuries.Monica Ali's expansive, epic best seller about decades in the life of a sheltered wife from Bangladesh in the titular London neighborhood is transformed into a compact, delicate tale of adultery, extremism, and awakening.Even when 9/11 is invoked the film doesn't so much suggest a melodrama of the heart and spirit as it does an explosion at a fabric store.A weepie that alternates between the poignant and the trite ... The acting is good, but the script is overwrought.Beautifully realized by Sarah Gavron, who fills Nazneen's story with gorgeous visuals and traditional music, creating a film that's dramatic, romantic and even erotic at times.Rich and subtle in its characterisation, Brick Lane is an enlightening tale about the breadth and depth of ordinary lives, how they intersect with history, and where they remain hidden away.The film is full of fabrics and shimmer and embroiderings of light and colour, giving a slender story the shy blush of art.Monica Ali's sensitive sprawling text about a Bangledeshi wife (Chatterjee) forced into an east London marriage gets a sanded-down blandification as it makes its lurch onto the big screen.Tannishtha Chatterjee, known in India for film and theatre work, is excellent as the vulnerable, isolated young woman who gradually builds herself into a resilient survivor who can smile and tame the pain of her worldTannishtha Chatterjee perfectly captures the emotional awakening of shy heroine Nazneen.Underwhelming.The romance at the heart of Brick Lane never comes alive. Chatterjee is doleful and weepy, Simpson enervated.Although well-acted and heartfelt, it provokes shrugged shoulders rather than the tears it's clearly striving for.Quietly effective, acted with resource and directed with the kind of patient skill it needs.Gavron's movie finds an unfashionably gentle, human optimism in the face of all this, and a sympathetic performance from Chatterjee makes it plausible.Monica Ali's best-selling debut novel about life in London's Bangladeshi quarter gets a sensitive treatment from director Sarah Gavron, deftly condensing its sprawling narrative without sacrificing colour or texture.Gavron cleverly outlines the closed-in boundaries of Nazneen's Brick Lane.It's a hard heart that isn't immersed by this delicately told tale.A depressing, static drama that will have heads lolling backwards and eyes drooping wherever it plays.The kind of meaningless middlebrow sludge that passes for \"quality movie-making\" in some of the more conservative sectors of the British film industryDon't expect too many surprises from this low-key story of a Bangladeshi woman who learns to stand on her own two feet after years of stultifying arranged marriage.Brick Lane is beautifully shot and superbly acted but the story is slow-moving and ultimately rather uneventful.The daily grind of a Brick Lane Bangladeshi is credibly brought to life in this sensitive and intelligent adaptation of Monica Ali's novel.Brick Lane is beautifully acted and written (by Abi Morgan and Laura Jones) so its themes are touched upon glancingly rather than with full force.Depth of character, such a distinctive quality of Ali's book, is sacrificed for simpler strokes and shallower dimensions, with an undue emphasis placed by helmer Sarah Gavron and lenser Robbie Ryan on gorgeous pictures.Based on Monica Ali's bestselling novel, this is an insightful look at a woman searching across cultural barriers for a place to belong. Not only is it a strong story, but it's great to see such an involving film set in London's Asian-Muslim community.The film's heart can't be faulted, but its head is working in a regrettably low gear.Brick Lane is so lovely that even a simple shot of empty hangers in a closet shimmers.Poignant and subtle, it tackles cross-cultural conflict and racial intolerance.[A] quietly observant and quite beautiful adaptation of the Monica Ali novel.Taken for what it is, Brick Lane is something entirely its own.Chanu, a torrent of frustration who seems to be no more happy with the union than his wife is, confronts Karim in a memorable scene that packs a spark the rest of the film lacks.Brick Lane is a grown-up movie. It recognizes that there are different kinds of love and that some of them don't involve happily-ever-afters.Small, intimate and achingly modern, Brick Lane is a lovely study involving both one woman's awakening and the inevitability of cross-cultural pollination.The story has many themes to contend with and sometimes accordingly becomes unfocused, but when fully controlled it's also quite moving and surprising.The slant is feminist, but the most interesting character is not the saintly and long-suffering wife but her initially ridiculous husband (wonderfully played by Satish Kaushik).Adapted from the 2003 Monica Ali novel, Brick Lane is one of those feminist cries in the dark in which the heroine, a saintly sufferer, is more admirable than interesting.One of those poorly chosen movie titles that does not do justice to the beautiful story told within.Its flat, static quality belies the novel's richness.While the film tackles the issue of what the concept of 'home' means for expats and emigrants, it can also be seen as a coming-of-age story for a woman in her mid-30s.As the plot unfolds, it becomes apparent that director Sarah Gavron also finds attractive people more sympathetic, and this is Brick Lane's undoing.As Nazneen, Tannishtha Chatterjee proves to be the quiet force that drives the film, ably projecting a depth of emotion with few words.Sarah Gavron's adaptation of Monica Ali's novel is a thoughtful and often evocative drama of identity and assimilation...Sarah Gavron's adaptation of Monica Ali's novel is a thoughtful and often evocative drama of identity and assimilation...Ultimately hopeful, Brick Lane feels careful enough to connect with its intentions, leaving behind an engaging, turbulent picture that pays careful concentration to the tender nuances of the longing, unfulfilled heart.[The film] hits all the clich\u00e9s of romantic literary adaptation: montage, letters read aloud in voice-over, a swelling musical score.Lazily relies upon the book's prestige to get by.Brick Lane is about characters who have depth and reality, who change and learn, who have genuine feelings. And it keeps on surprising us, right to the end.A sense of isolation and struggle for identity in an oppressive culture wash away superfluous formula, leaving a lovely tranquility in their wake.A sensitive and occasionally poetic film, Brick Lane is an absorbing tale of personal empowerment and emotional growth.Weighty tearjerker with mature themes.It's a testament to Kaushik's acting ability that he turns what could have been an odious character into a quite likeable one.Brick Lane has beautiful scenery and some enjoyable moments but leaves the viewer feeling the need to find the book to get the rest of the story.Interview: These two incredibly insightful women (director Sarah Gavron and lead actress Tannishtha Chatterjee) talk about the essence in creating this amazing female lead and an overall perspective on the Muslim experience in London.Gavron coaxes good performances from her cast, and she captures the look and feel of council housing in East End London...Little more than an old story dressed up in contemporary trappings, but in this case they elevate the formula.[Chaterjee's] is a face that finds a profound eloquence in silence, transmitting an insistent intensity to the emotions revealed...an economically poignant melodrama about a young Muslim girl's fragile mindset and the journey that leads to her self-discovery...relentlessly affecting in mind and consciousness.Stripped of a mediating point of view, the film is just a series of pretty pictures and awkwardly connected incidents.To hint that a heroine might have any flaws whatsoever would be just a bit too modern for this picture.Well-acted and grounded in reality.[A] glossy but overly efficient drama that, like Nazneen's husband, is ultimately too ineffectual to make much of a dent.For most of the movie, we feel as trapped as she does, and the lurching narrative seems anything but novelistic.In Brick Lane's London, Nazneen is confined by a series of small rooms and doorways, narrow streets and muted colors.Certainly touching, even heart-rending at times, and it mostly steers clear of the didacticism and sentimentality its subject matter often invites. But it never takes the full measure of its modest heroine, and makes her world a bit too small.Where it's going all seems predetermined, but the visual journey is lovely, Robbie Ryan's camera turning even council-housing London into something optically enchanting.",
