        "summary": "\u2013 It's a race for the governor's mansion in 11 states today, and the GOP could end the night at the helm of more than two-thirds of the 50 states. The GOP currently controls 29 of the country's top state offices; it's expected to keep the three Republican ones that are up for grabs (Utah, North Dakota, and Indiana), and wrest North Carolina from the Dems. That brings its toll to 30, with the potential to take three more, reports NPR. Races in Montana, New Hampshire, and Washington are still too close to call, and in all three, Democrat incumbents aren't seeking reelection. The results could have a big impact on health care, since a Supreme Court ruling grants states the ability to opt out of ObamaCare's Medicaid expansion. \"A Romney victory would dramatically empower Republican governors,\" said one analyst.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR First of all, with regards to the picture: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The photo which was used to illustrate my first post about the John Snow Kiss-In is a promotional still from the British soap opera \u201cEastenders.\u201d It features one of the main characters from the show (Christian Clarke, played by the actor John Partridge- left) and someone else who I don\u2019t know. I am not a regular viewer so I can\u2019t say if the man on the right is an extra or an actual character. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This picture has itself caused scandal in the UK, as it was a gay kiss that was broadcast before the watershed, and as such led to a number of complaints to the BBC. However, since this episode aired (October 2008) Christian now has a boyfriend and a few more gay kisses have taken place. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In relation to the John Snow Kiss-In event, I used this particular photo because I considered it to be quite mild (no groping, no tongues). The photos I had considered using before I chose that one are much more racy. Oh the irony! NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Secondly, the removal of the Facebook John Snow Kiss-In event: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It turns out that the Facebook event for the John Snow Kiss-In was not blocked by Facebook, but made private by the creator of the event itself. Paul Shetler, the organizer, left this comment on the previous thread: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cHey I just saw this. Before it goes too far, I just want people to know that FB have NOT removed the kiss-in event page; it\u2019s still there, but _I made the event private after the event_ was over and only visible to those who had been invited as there were starting to be trolls posting abusive nonsense on it.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Thanks for clearing that up, Paul. Now if Facebook will only reply to Richard\u2019s query about why they removed my original post and photo when he put it up on his wall\u2026 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It has been erroneously reported in the media that our own Richard Metzger (who lives in Los Angeles) organized the London \u201cKiss-In\u201d event, which is untrue, and also unfair to Paul Shetler and the actual organizers. Also, Richard did not state in his post that Facebook HAD taken the event page down, he just questioned IF this was the case and IF there was a connection with MY post about the event being removed from his own wall. This seems to have confused some people. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Here is a report on the John Snow Kiss-In from the Guardian, featuring an interview with Mr Shetler: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ||||| || News || NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Page 1 of 1 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR UPDATED: A photo of two men kissing that was posted on a Facebook page protesting a London pub\u2019s decision to eject a same-sex couple for kissing has been removed by the social networking site, an error, according to a rep for the company. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The photo in question does not violate our Statement of Rights and Responsibilities and was removed in error,\" the statement, obtained by America Blog, says. We apologize for the inconvenience\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Dangerous Minds Facebook page was set up to promote a \u201cgay kiss-in\u201d demonstration in London to protest the pub. The page used a photo of two men kissing to promote the event. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to NYULocal.com, the photo was quickly removed and the following e-mail was sent to administrators of the Facebook page: \u201cShares that contain nudity, or any kind of graphic or sexually suggestive content, are not permitted on Facebook.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The decision to remove the photo has prompted scores of people to post their own pictures of same-sex couples kissing in protest \u2014 dozens in the last few hours alone.\n",
        "summary": "\u2013 It turns out Facebook is only guilty of about half of what it\u2019s been accused of in the gay kiss incident.

But Facebook did not, as has been reported in several places, take down the kiss-in event itself. Here\u2019s what happened: The photo Facebook took down was posted by the Dangerous Minds blog to promote the event. In its initial write-up about the incident, the blog observed that the page organizing the protest had been taken down. But it was actually the organizer himself who \"removed\" the event, Dangerous Minds clarified.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fed up by Sacramento's regulations and Southern California's political sway, residents in one rural Northern California county are taking steps to leave the state. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Siskiyou County Board of Supervisors voted, 4-1, on Tuesday to pursue seceding from California, the Redding Record Searchlight reported. Proponents say Siskiyou should form a new state -- called Jefferson -- with other counties in Northern California and Southern Oregon they believe share similar interests. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Tuesday more than 100 people filled the supervisors' chambers, many of whom indicated support for the declaration, the Searchlight reported. When a speaker asked those in the audience who was in favor, \"nearly every hand in the room was raised,\" the newspaper said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Many proposed laws are unconstitutional and deny us our God-given rights,\" said Happy Camp resident Gabe Garrison. \"We need our own state so we can make laws that fit our way of life.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The state of Jefferson is the place I want to raise my son,\" Kayla Brown said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Resident complaints include a lack of representation in Sacramento and insufficient attention to major issues for the county, such as water rights and a rural fire prevention fee, the Searchlight reported. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We have to have government that's local, understands our issues and has empathy,\" said Mark Baird, a rancher who the Searchlight said was heading the effort. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Supervisor Marcia Armstrong cited restoration of limited government as one of the reasons she supported the declaration. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We also have this enormous bureaucracy of unelected officials making decisions for us,\" she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Supervisor Ed Valenzuela, who chairs the board, was the only vote against the decision, the Searchlight said. He cited the oath he took upon his reelection to \"uphold the Constitution and uphold the constitution of the state of California.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I signed on to work within the system I know,\" he said. \"I don't like it, I don't agree with it all the time, but ... I did sign up for that and I will continue to do so.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Neighboring counties, which would be invited to join Jefferson, are also weighing secession. Humboldt County Supervisor Rex Bohn told the Times-Standard that his board would probably meet to consider their options. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I was one of the people who thinks the state of Jefferson wasn't a bad idea,\" he told the newspaper. \"There has been a total lack of respect of our water rights and the fire fee. Those things may not be important to the rest of the state, but it's important to us.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Secession efforts within California date back to the 1800s. The most recent high-profile attempt came in 2011, when Riverside County officials weighed a proposal to pursue the establishment of \"South California,\" which would have seen 13 counties leave the Golden State. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR [For the Record, 1:50 p.m. PDT Sept. 4: An earlier version of this post incorrectly attributed Humboldt County Supervisor Rex Bohn's comments on the state of Jefferson to the Redding Record Searchlight.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It's the first in a long series of steps to form the proposed state of Jefferson, which proponents of the effort say would bring representation to rural North State counties that currently are beholden to the whims of representatives of the more heavily populated Southern California and free them from burdensome state regulations. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201dWe have to have government that's local, understands our issues and has empathy\u201d for those affected, said Mark Baird, a Scott Valley rancher who's also president for Scott Valley Protect Our Water and vice president of the Siskiyou Water User's Association. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Baird is leading the charge to form a new state from rural counties in Northern California and Southern Oregon, though he certainly wasn't the only voice in support of the move. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR More than 100 people packed the supervisors' chambers Tuesday for the discussion on whether the county should issue a declaration that it wants to secede from the state. Nearly all those in attendance appeared to be for the move and about a dozen spoke in support of it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201dMany proposed laws are unconstitutional and deny us our God-given rights,\u201d said Gabe Garrison of Happy Camp. \u201cWe need our own state so we can make laws that fit our way of life.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Among those in attendance was Erin Ryan, field representative for Rep. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Doug LaMalfa. When asked for the congressman's opinion, she said that she and other LaMalfa staff members supported the effort to secede, but she did not know LaMalfa's thoughts on it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She also said there's support for the split in Sacramento. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The discussion also attracted members of groups from Shasta and Tehama counties who are looking for their own supervisors to pass similar declarations. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201dIt would be the only way I could see everyone coming together in a positive manner,\u201d said Tom Moller of Red Bluff. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Also there was Kayla Brown, a mother in her early 20s, who said she didn't want to raise her child in California. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201dThe state of Jefferson is the place I want to raise my son,\u201d she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At one point in the meeting a speaker asked for a show of hands from those in attendance who supported the split. Nearly every hand in the room was raised. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And supervisors echoed much of that enthusiasm in their own comments. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201dI haven't had one contact in regard to this issue, that's in opposition,\u201d Supervisor Michael Kobseff said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Supervisor Marcia Armstrong said the issues were about regulation, restriction of rights, lack of representation, regionalism and restoration of limited government. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201dWe also have this enormous bureaucracy of unelected officials making decisions for us,\u201d she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Board Chair Ed Valenzuela was the sole vote against the declaration. He said he was elected to solve problems within the system. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201dIt comes down to because I took an oath. I took an oath when I ran for re-election, which I just did, and that was to uphold the Constitution, and uphold the constitution of the state of California,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd within that, and because knowing what it's like to be a minority, I know the value of having to work from the other side without the numbers and without support. I signed on to do that, I signed on to work within the system I know. I don't like it, I don't agree with it all the time but at the same token, I did sign up for that and I will continue to do so.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In August, county residents lobbied the board to consider separating from the state over a laundry list of complaints including a lack of representation in Sacramento for the Republican-majority county, issues pertaining to water rights and the rural fire prevention fee. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If the county were to split from the state, any action taken today would be the first step in a long process that would require approval from the state Legislature and the U.S. Congress. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Siskiyou County would also invite other neighboring counties in California and Southern Oregon to join in the effort to create a new state. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The U.S. Constitution allows for the formation of new states, though land can't be taken from existing states without the consent of state and federal governments. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Humboldt County 1st District Supervisor Rex Bohn said he can understand the frustration in Siskiyou County and that he tends to agree with most of the issues that were brought up by the board. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201dI was one of the people who thinks the State of Jefferson wasn't a bad idea,\u201d Bohn said. \u201cThere has been a total lack of respect in terms of our water rights and the fire fee. Those things may not be important to the rest of the state, but it's important to us. This is a major thing for everyone that lives rurally.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bohn said the problem is that only 16 percent of the state is rural, and decisions in Sacramento are sometimes based on the needs or realities of more urban areas. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201dIt's kind of a drastic measure to get someone to listen to you, but I guess they feel like they're not getting heard,\u201d he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bohn added that the Humboldt County supervisors will likely meet to discuss the issue. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Humboldt County 3rd District Supervisor Mark Lovelace said he took the talk of secession as a statement of frustration. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201dThere has to be basic economic underpinnings to make a state work,\u201d Lovelace said. \u201cThere is a certain romantic appeal and allure to the state of Jefferson, this entire idea of what could have been, but in reality it would not be good economically.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He said one of the problems with a rural county seceding is that the tax base starts small. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201dSiskiyou is one of the largest counties with one of the smallest populations,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is also full of state roads that they won't be able to maintain, and federal land.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Times-Standard staff writer Catherine Wong contributed to this report.\n",
        "summary": "\u2013 Not a big fan of Southern California? Neither is Northern California, apparently. Supervisors in rural Siskiyou County voted 4-1 Tuesday in favor of seceding from the state, reports the Times-Standard. The county thinks state officials in Sacramento are too focused on the big metro areas of the south and thus want to form a state of its own\u2014to be called Jefferson. Supporters want to invite other northern counties, and perhaps a few from Oregon, to join, too, notes the Los Angeles Times. \u201dWe have to have government that's local, understands our issues, and has empathy,\u201d says one local rancher. It's clearly a very long-shot bid, one that would eventually require the blessing of both the state legislature and the US Congress. Still, neighboring Humboldt County is expected to meet soon to consider the idea. (Meanwhile, some counties in Colorado want to form a new state of their own.)\n"

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Microsoft has been working on its evolution into a devices and services company, away from the services business it has traditionally been, for several years now with limited success. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Its acquisition of most of Nokia is the latest acceleration of that strategy \u2014 to move further away from the moribund world of the beige desktop and towards the sunlit world of smartphones and tablets. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Owning the desktop (via Windows) and building additional services on top, like Office or search, has been vital for Microsoft's strategy until now, so as our interest shifts from the desktop to the tablet or smartphone it's essential to Microsoft's broader business (even Azure) that it can retain that connection in some form. To be a winner in the business market it also has to be a winner in the consumer market, something that wasn't the case a decade ago. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As Microsoft's own presentation about the deal, announced on Monday, notes: \"With the consumerisation of IT user matter at both home and work... We cannot risk having Apple or Google foreclose app innovation, integration, distribution or economics.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nokia lashed itself to Microsoft's mast after losing out to iOS and Android in the smartphone market share stakes and with the limited success of the Lumia range so far enough to keep interest in Windows Phone alive, most analysts are seeing a certain amount of inevitability to the acquisition, even if they are split on what its biggest implications are. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Forrester mobile analyst Charles Golvin said the steadily diminishing investments by other Windows Phone licensees has left Microsoft with just Nokia as its standard bearer and added Microsoft now appears \"poised to adopt a vertically integrated strategy more akin to Apple's\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But he said Microsoft's challenge remains how to unite the myriad services and brands \u2014 Windows, Nokia, Live, Surface, Xbox, Bing and more \u2014 into a cohesive experience that will command and cement customer loyalty. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"That's a tall order and one that should weigh strongly on the board's choice of a new CEO,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Richard Holway, chairman of analyst TechMarketView, said given that Microsoft paid $8.5bn for Skype in 2011, the price it is paying for Nokia \"seems extremely reasonable\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However, he added: \"Our only 'surprise' now is the timing of the announcement. For such a big deal to come just days after Ballmer stood down seems mighty strange.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For Holway, there is also an opportunity for the enlarged Microsoft to step up its business mobility efforts: \"There is undoubtedly a market opportunity for the creation of a provider of mobile solutions for the enterprise. Taking Office onto various mobile platforms. Providing secure emailing in a sector once occupied by BlackBerry.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But such a move carries its own risks \u2014 Microsoft's success has been build on being hardware agnostic and persuading device manufacturers to support it. Already its move into the tablet market with Surface will have unsettled its manufacturers which have struggled to come up with convincing form factors to tackle the decline of the PC. If Nokia's rumoured tablet appears too, this will further complicate Microsoft's relations with these partners who are essential for the success of Windows 8 (as well as Office and other products). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But, as Holway points out, \"on balance, Microsoft needed to make a bold move into mobile. Not doing so would mean certain terminal decline. This way at least holds out some chance of survival.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Carolina Milanesi, research vice president at analyst Gartner, said by buying rather than just partnering with Nokia, Microsoft gets deeper integration, the benefit of its patents and removes any risk of Nokia either going Android or being acquired by someone else. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But success against iOS and Android will depend on how the companies integrate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Nokia benefits from higher R&D spend as well as more marketing budget. Microsoft benefits from a good relationship with carriers, good direct channel presence in emerging markets, the potential of going after more aggressively to the business market,\" she told ZDNet. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But for Milanesi, business is a secondary concern, even if it is an attractive target where Microsoft, and to a less extent Nokia, have experience: \"First and foremost it needs to be about consumers. Enterprise are certainly a target especially considering the state BlackBerry is in but consumers make or break a phone vendor today.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR From Milanesi's point of view, emerging markets need to be a longer term target for Microsoft \u2014 but the battle needs to be won in the mature markets first. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For Forrester principal analyst Thomas Husson, Nokia adds to Microsoft's developing market strategy. It's looking increasingly likely that the US and western European smartphone market is reaching saturation, so that most growth will come from emerging markets. Here Nokia's Asha devices could play a neat role as an 'on-ramp' for consumers buying their first smartphone. Tied in with a revamped tablet strategy this could open up a new front against Android in particular. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Husson cautioned: \"This is going to be a long journey. In some countries, Windows Phone 8 market share is now above five percent and close to 10 percent. It thus still offers a limited reach for developers and marketers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Nokia is indeed still massivley popular in some emerging countries but competition is very high with Far East manufacturers and low-cost Android devices. I think it will depend on Microsoft's new strategy for emerging markets beyond just mobile phones.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR All of this shows the number of competing \u2014 and occasionally contradictory \u2014 demands upon Microsoft's management. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As the incumbent player in a fading market, Microsoft has a take into account those differing requirements as it tries to build for the future. For example, balancing Microsoft's business customers against the need to get into consumer tech, the need to build its own hardware business against the need to keep manufacturers onside, and building up a mobile business while protecting its PC heritage. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It's easy to look at Apple's integrated hardware and software model and the rich ecosystem that sits around it, but it's much harder to emulate.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 2003, Nokia's cell phone market share exceeded 35%. That same year, its phone business alone posted an operating profit of 5.48 billion euros. Today's sale price, which includes 1.65 billion euros in patents, is just 5.44 billion euros. It's been a rough decade. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nokia's cell phone collapse has been a spectacular one. The Finnish giant dominated the dumbphone era after Motorola, another faded star that recently fell into the hands of a comparative upstart. But it was blindsided by Apple, then deprived of a chance to regain its footing by an even more aggressive Google, which followed close behind. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The story, in hindsight, is simple: Nokia did not have a truly compelling smartphone ready when a large segment of the developed world was first compelled by smartphones. Whether this was the result of complacency \u2014 Nokia was, in the mid-2000s, the leader of the niche smartphone category \u2014 doesn't matter now. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nokia's miscalculations became impossible to ignore in 2008, the same year Microsoft decided, internally at least, to scrap its ancient and inadequate Windows Mobile platform in favor of something entirely new. Under these circumstances, it's easy to imagine how a sort of camaraderie might have emerged at the time, or at least a mutual sympathy. Certainly a shared interest: to break back into the market from which they had been unceremoniously expelled. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR During the next two years, while Microsoft readied Windows Phone 7 and Nokia floundered on, the seeds of Sunday's deal were sewn. A chastened Nokia was a natural partner for the tardy but determined Microsoft; it needed a software solution and Microsoft needed help with hardware. The 2009 vision of 2013 renders clearly: Two giants, united after some missteps, regain their rightful place. By 2010, when the head of Microsoft's Business division left to take the helm at Nokia, the gears were moving. Many at the time wondered if Stephen Elop's time at Nokia would be spent grooming the company for purchase \u2014 a foreigner in all possible ways, he began his time at the company with a memo rightly but offensively declaring Nokia's proud platform a failure, and quickly pledged the company's commitment to the still-tiny Windows Phone. It felt like a radical about-face, but no matter: Nokia and Microsoft were going to save each other. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now, with Elop returning to Microsoft after a job well done \u2014 well, a job, done \u2014that plan has come to fruition. The only problem is that there's little left to save. Windows Phone has barely dented the now much larger smartphone market. Nokia hasn't had a Windows Phone hit. This incongruity \u2014 between a successfully executed, slyly strategic long-term merger plan and a much grander, more general sense of failure \u2014 might explain Microsoft's deeply strange and somewhat sad stated goals for its Nokia acquisition. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Microsoft' s \"Strategic Rationale,\" titled \"Accelerating Growth,\" is a disjointed and bizarre document. It manages to sound both insane and uninspiring, outlining modest goals that still sound unrealistic. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For example, it lays out a plan to pull in over $45 billion dollars in smartphone revenue by 2018. But it plans on doing this by securing just 15% of the projected global smartphone market \u2014 not exactly a world-beating plan, keeping in mind the time frame. Consider: 2018 is five years away. Five years ago was the year the App Store first opened. ||||| Hello there, NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There is a pertinent story about a man who was working on an oil platform in the North Sea. He woke up one night from a loud explosion, which suddenly set his entire oil platform on fire. In mere moments, he was surrounded by flames. Through the smoke and heat, he barely made his way out of the chaos to the platform's edge. When he looked down over the edge, all he could see were the dark, cold, foreboding Atlantic waters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As the fire approached him, the man had mere seconds to react. He could stand on the platform, and inevitably be consumed by the burning flames. Or, he could plunge 30 meters in to the freezing waters. The man was standing upon a \"burning platform,\" and he needed to make a choice. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He decided to jump. It was unexpected. In ordinary circumstances, the man would never consider plunging into icy waters. But these were not ordinary times - his platform was on fire. The man survived the fall and the waters. After he was rescued, he noted that a \"burning platform\" caused a radical change in his behaviour. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR We too, are standing on a \"burning platform,\" and we must decide how we are going to change our behaviour. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Over the past few months, I've shared with you what I've heard from our shareholders, operators, developers, suppliers and from you. Today, I'm going to share what I've learned and what I have come to believe. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I have learned that we are standing on a burning platform. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And, we have more than one explosion - we have multiple points of scorching heat that are fuelling a blazing fire around us. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For example, there is intense heat coming from our competitors, more rapidly than we ever expected. Apple disrupted the market by redefining the smartphone and attracting developers to a closed, but very powerful ecosystem. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 2008, Apple's market share in the $300+ price range was 25 percent; by 2010 it escalated to 61 percent. They are enjoying a tremendous growth trajectory with a 78 percent earnings growth year over year in Q4 2010. Apple demonstrated that if designed well, consumers would buy a high-priced phone with a great experience and developers would build applications. They changed the game, and today, Apple owns the high-end range. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And then, there is Android. In about two years, Android created a platform that attracts application developers, service providers and hardware manufacturers. Android came in at the high-end, they are now winning the mid-range, and quickly they are going downstream to phones under \u20ac100. Google has become a gravitational force, drawing much of the industry's innovation to its core. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Let's not forget about the low-end price range. In 2008, MediaTek supplied complete reference designs for phone chipsets, which enabled manufacturers in the Shenzhen region of China to produce phones at an unbelievable pace. By some accounts, this ecosystem now produces more than one third of the phones sold globally - taking share from us in emerging markets. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While competitors poured flames on our market share, what happened at Nokia? We fell behind, we missed big trends, and we lost time. At that time, we thought we were making the right decisions; but, with the benefit of hindsight, we now find ourselves years behind. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The first iPhone shipped in 2007, and we still don't have a product that is close to their experience. Android came on the scene just over 2 years ago, and this week they took our leadership position in smartphone volumes. Unbelievable. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR We have some brilliant sources of innovation inside Nokia, but we are not bringing it to market fast enough. We thought MeeGo would be a platform for winning high-end smartphones. However, at this rate, by the end of 2011, we might have only one MeeGo product in the market. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At the midrange, we have Symbian. It has proven to be non-competitive in leading markets like North America. Additionally, Symbian is proving to be an increasingly difficult environment in which to develop to meet the continuously expanding consumer requirements, leading to slowness in product development and also creating a disadvantage when we seek to take advantage of new hardware platforms. As a result, if we continue like before, we will get further and further behind, while our competitors advance further and further ahead. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At the lower-end price range, Chinese OEMs are cranking out a device much faster than, as one Nokia employee said only partially in jest, \"the time that it takes us to polish a PowerPoint presentation.\" They are fast, they are cheap, and they are challenging us. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And the truly perplexing aspect is that we're not even fighting with the right weapons. We are still too often trying to approach each price range on a device-to-device basis. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The battle of devices has now become a war of ecosystems, where ecosystems include not only the hardware and software of the device, but developers, applications, ecommerce, advertising, search, social applications, location-based services, unified communications and many other things. Our competitors aren't taking our market share with devices; they are taking our market share with an entire ecosystem. This means we're going to have to decide how we either build, catalyse or join an ecosystem. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This is one of the decisions we need to make. In the meantime, we've lost market share, we've lost mind share and we've lost time. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Tuesday, Standard & Poor's informed that they will put our A long term and A-1 short term ratings on negative credit watch. This is a similar rating action to the one that Moody's took last week. Basically it means that during the next few weeks they will make an analysis of Nokia, and decide on a possible credit rating downgrade. Why are these credit agencies contemplating these changes? Because they are concerned about our competitiveness. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Consumer preference for Nokia declined worldwide. In the UK, our brand preference has slipped to 20 percent, which is 8 percent lower than last year. That means only 1 out of 5 people in the UK prefer Nokia to other brands. It's also down in the other markets, which are traditionally our strongholds: Russia, Germany, Indonesia, UAE, and on and on and on. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR How did we get to this point? Why did we fall behind when the world around us evolved? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This is what I have been trying to understand. I believe at least some of it has been due to our attitude inside Nokia. We poured gasoline on our own burning platform. I believe we have lacked accountability and leadership to align and direct the company through these disruptive times. We had a series of misses. We haven't been delivering innovation fast enough. We're not collaborating internally. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nokia, our platform is burning. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR We are working on a path forward -- a path to rebuild our market leadership. When we share the new strategy on February 11, it will be a huge effort to transform our company. But, I believe that together, we can face the challenges ahead of us. Together, we can choose to define our future. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The burning platform, upon which the man found himself, caused the man to shift his behaviour, and take a bold and brave step into an uncertain future. He was able to tell his story. Now, we have a great opportunity to do the same. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Stephen.\n",
        "summary": "\u2013 Why did Microsoft buy Nokia's phone business? We now know Microsoft's answer: The computing giant released a 30-slide presentation today arguing that the move will improve Microsoft's margins on Windows phones, which will allow it to invest more in the platform, which will accelerate sales and market share growth, the Washington Post reports. But John Herrman at Buzzfeed has another explanation: \"Fear of dying alone.\" Here's what he and other pundits are saying: The presentation \"manages to sound both insane and uninspiring, outlining modest goals that still sound unrealistic,\" Herman argues\u2014like capturing a whole 15% of the smartphone market. \"It's a fitting end for the close of Microsoft's Ballmer era, during which the company \u2026 missed out on the most important change in consumer electronics in decades\" while remaining profitable in unglamorous ways. Like everyone, Microsoft is trying to ape the Apple model, MobileOpportunity observes. But it's not so sure that's a good idea. \"There already is an apple,\" the blog points out, and other software/hardware hybrid companies, like Palm and BlackBerry, have been crushed under its heel. Maybe Microsoft should have tried to patch up its tried-and-true strategy of licensing its OS. The move risks complicating Microsoft's crucial relationships with other PC and device manufacturers, one analyst tells ZDNet. But he adds that \"Microsoft needed to make a bold move\" or face \"certain terminal decline,\" and that the price it paid for Nokia \"seems extremely reasonable.\" Meanwhile, Matthew Yglesias at Slate digs up a fairly interesting memo from Nokia CEO (and, perhaps, Microsoft heir apparent) Stephen Elop, in which he uses the story of a Deepwater Horizon worker leaping from the burning oil platform\u2014a seemingly desperate, yet necessary move\u2014to explain the company's shift from its own failed OS to Windows Phone. Of course, Yglesias notes, that move \"was basically a total failure.\" To read the full parable, click here.\n"

        "document": "After a year in which liberals scored impressive, high-profile Supreme Court victories, conservatives could be in line for wins on some of this term's most contentious issues, as the justices consider cases that could gut public sector labor unions and roll back affirmative action at state universities. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However, as the court's new term kicks off Monday, uncertainty surrounds several other politically potent cases that could wind up on the court\u2019s agenda. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Story Continued Below NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Litigation over state efforts to limit abortion by regulating clinics and doctors is making its way to the high court. And the justices are already facing a batch of petitions involving the rights of religious institutions to opt out of providing contraception under Obamacare. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Both issues seem likely to land on this term's docket, although the justices haven\u2019t formally taken up either. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Many in the Obama administration would also like to see the court weigh in on immigration in coming months, upholding the president\u2019s right to grant quasi-legal status and work permits to millions of immigrants who entered the U.S. illegally as children. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But it\u2019s unclear whether that fight will get to the justices in time for a decision this term or whether Obama\u2019s effort to expand his executive actions on immigration will remain blocked by a lower court order until the president leaves office. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Here\u2019s POLITICO\u2019s look at five of the most important cases the justices could grapple with soon: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A potential body blow to labor NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Public-employee unions and politicians of both parties are keenly focused on a California dispute about whether states can compel government employees to pay union dues. A loss for the unions could sharply diminish the clout of a movement already struggling with its political relevance. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The case, Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association, was brought by Orange County, Calif. schoolteacher Rebecca Friedrichs and other teachers, who are arguing that forcing them to pay union dues violates their First Amendment rights. They also contend that unions should have to get permission before collecting dues used for political purposes, as opposed to the current system that requires objecting employees to opt out. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThe significance is substantial, either way it comes out,\u201d said University of California at Irvine Law Professor Catherine Fisk. \u201cThe reason why conservative lawyers are bringing these case is the hope that a significant number of government employees choose not to join the union and certain government employee unions will be weaker.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Roberts court has not been friendly to unions, issuing a 5-4 ruling last year that prohibited mandatory union fees for home health workers but stopped short of banning so-called \u201cagency shops\u201d in government. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The new case directly asks the justices to overturn a 38-year-old precedent that allows all workers covered by union negotiations to be charged for representation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR How the case will be resolved is unclear, partly because the conservative justices often see limits on government employee\u2019s First Amendment rights when their speech is at issue. Fisk said the unions are \u201crationally fearful\u201d about what the court will do, but she thinks the justices might end up dumping the case after it\u2019s heard. \u201cI think the case raises so many doctrinal problems for them,\u201d she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Higher ed affirmative action back in the crosshairs NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Two years after punting the case back to an appeals court, the justices will take a second crack at resolving a dispute about the constitutionality of the University of Texas at Austin's affirmative action program. The case was brought by rejected applicant Abigail Fisher, who contends she was rejected because of her race. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The last time Fisher\u2019s case went before the high court, affirmative action opponents hoped it would serve as a vehicle to pare back preferences for racial and ethnic groups at government-run schools. However, the justices instead told the 5th Circuit it had been too deferential to the University of Texas\u2019s claims that the programs were narrowly tailored to promote diversity. Justice Anthony Kennedy won the support of six other justices for a decision that said such programs must be handled with \"strict scrutiny,\u201d but the decision did not suggest they were automatically unconstitutional. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Justice Elena Kagan has recused herself because she was involved in the case during her previous service as solicitor general. The real question is whether Kennedy will join the four other Republican appointees in setting such a high bar for affirmative action that many public colleges will abandon the preferences and admissions practices they use to achieve racial and ethnic diversity. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The meaning of \"one person, one vote\u2019 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A Texas case has the potential to deal a blow to Latino political clout, tilting the balance of power away from urban areas and towards suburban and rural areas with more white voters. Evenwel v. Abbott presents the question of whether state legislative districts can be apportioned using a count of eligible voters rather than a count of all people. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If immigrants (both illegal and legal) as well as children can be left out of the count, \u201cthe rural areas where voters tend to have fewer non-citizens or where there are fewer young people concentrated would necessarily gain,\u201d said New York University Law Professor Rick Pildes. \u201cIt\u2019s a reasonable inference if the urban areas are more Democratic leaning that they would lose power to more Republican rural areas.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Congressional redistricting shouldn\u2019t be directly affected by the case, Pildes said, because the Constitution says the U.S. census used for that reapportionment should be based on each state's population. But others say the ruling could spill over into Congressional redistricting down the line. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Religious nonprofits and Obamacare NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the Hobby Lobby case last year, the justices allowed for-profit companies to seek religious exemptions from Obamacare\u2019s coverage requirements. But now, several religious-affiliated schools and institutions \u2013including the Little Sisters of the Poor nursing home in Denver \u2013 have filed lawsuits, too. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They argue that the administration\u2019s process for allowing religious nonprofits to opt out of the contraception requirement requires them to violate their religious beliefs. The Supreme Court has eight petitions \u2013 including one that just arrived from the federal government \u2014 on this issue. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some prominent judges are effectively begging the Supreme Court to jump in by lamenting the refusal of some courts to protect the largely-Catholic religious entities from sanctions for failing to fill out paperwork that triggers the contraception exemption but also sets in motion coverage from others. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cHow ironic that this most consequential claim of religious free exercise, with literally millions of dollars in fines and immortal souls on the line, should be denied when nearly every other individual religious freedom claim has been upheld by this court,\u201d 5th Circuit Judge Edith Jones complained in a dissent last week. \u201cHow tragic to see the humiliation of sincere religious practitioners, which, coming from the federal government and its courts, implicitly denigrates the orthodoxy to which their lives bear testament. And both ironic and tragic is the harm to the Judeo-Christian heritage whose practitioners brought religious toleration to full fruition in this nation. Undermine this heritage, as our founders knew, and the props of morality and civic virtue will be destroyed.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The justices haven\u2019t signaled which of the challenges, if any, they\u2019ll consider but are expected to do so in the coming weeks. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Testing when abortion clinic regulations go too far NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Two of the latest tactics in the abortion wars could wind up before the justices this term: requirements that doctors performing abortions have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals and that abortion clinics meet standards for hospitals or surgical centers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An appeals court has upheld most such limits in Texas, but in June the Supreme Court voted, 5-4, to block key parts of the law until the justices decide whether to weigh in. Petitions to take up that case and a similar law in Mississippi are already pending at the Supreme Court. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Supporters of the laws say they are designed to protect women's health, but abortion providers and abortion rights advocates say the laws would force many clinics to close and penalize poor women who could not afford travel to distant clinics. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A similar Wisconsin law led to combative oral arguments in front of the 7th Circuit last week. Judge Richard Posner suggested the law was a transparent effort to prevent abortions, not aid women. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cGovernor Walker, before he withdrew from the presidential competition, said he thought abortion should be forbidden even if the mother dies as a result, \" Judge Richard Posner said to a lawyer for the state, in remarks first reported by the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel. \"Is that kind of official Wisconsin policy?\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThat perhaps is Governor Walker\u2019s personal view, but it\u2019s not a state policy,\u201d Assistant Attorney General Brian Keenan replied. Keenan insisted requiring doctors to have admitting privileges was a reasonable precaution to aid women. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThe admitting privileges would benefit the continuity of care for the woman when she goes to that hospital,\u201d he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Posner said the fact that the law was intended to kick in one business day after it was passed made clear the authors' intentions. \u201cThat statute can\u2019t be justified in terms of women\u2019s health,\u201d the judge said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jennifer Haberkorn contributed to this report. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ||||| The new term\u2019s biggest rulings will land in June, as the 2016 presidential campaign enters its final stretch, and they will help shape the political debate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cConstitutional law and politics are certainly not the same thing, but they are interrelated, never more so than in a presidential election year that will likely determine who gets to appoint the next justice or two or three,\u201d said Vikram D. Amar, dean of the University of Illinois College of Law. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By the time the next president is inaugurated, Justice Stephen G. Breyer will be 78, Justices Scalia and Kennedy will be 80, and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg will be 83. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThis coming term will again put into focus that the court is divided along partisan lines and that the 2016 presidential elections will be hugely consequential in shaping constitutional and other law for perhaps a generation or more,\u201d said Neal E. Devins, a law professor at William & Mary. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The current court is the first in history split along partisan lines, where the party of the president who appointed each justice is a reliable predictor of judicial ideology. Put another way, all five Republican appointees are to the right of all four Democratic appointees. It was not long ago that Republican appointees like Justices John Paul Stevens and David H. Souter routinely voted with the court\u2019s liberal wing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As a consequence of the current alignment, Professor Devins said, \u201cthe Roberts court has generated more marquee decisions divided by party alignment than all other courts combined.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The last term\u2019s big cases did not for the most part follow that pattern because Justice Kennedy, who was appointed by President Ronald Reagan and sits at the court\u2019s ideological fulcrum, voted with the court\u2019s liberal wing at an unusually high rate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement Continue reading the main story NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThe story of the last term is that the left side of the court did a lot of winning,\u201d said Irving L. Gornstein, the executive director of Georgetown\u2019s Supreme Court Institute. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThis term,\u201d he added, \u201cI would expect a return to the norm, with the right side of the court winning a majority but by no means all of the big cases, with Justice Kennedy again the key vote.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The cases on unions and affirmative action, for instance, were almost certainly added to the docket by the more conservative justices in the confidence that they would be able to move the law to the right. Both cases were created by legal entrepreneurs and brought on behalf of plaintiffs recruited by conservative groups. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Photo NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The case on unions, Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association, No. 14-915, may deal a blow to organized labor. \u201cIt could set the stage for a Citizens United-style reconsideration in the area of union dues,\u201d said John P. Elwood, a lawyer at Vinson & Elkins, referring to the 2010 decision that transformed campaign finance law. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The new case takes aim at a compromise fashioned by the court in 1977 in Abood v. Detroit Board of Education. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In Abood, the court said public workers who decline to join a union can nevertheless be required to pay for the union\u2019s collective bargaining efforts to prevent freeloading and ensure \u201clabor peace.\u201d But nonmembers, the court went on, cannot be forced to pay for the union\u2019s purely political activities, as that would amount to forbidden compelled speech under the First Amendment.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The California teachers who brought the new case say t collective bargaining is itself political, as it concerns public policy on spending, seniority, class size and the like. Unions respond that the case is a First Amendment Trojan horse designed to further weaken the power of organized labor. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The unions have reason to be nervous.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin, No. 14-981, the court will return to the subject of whether the Constitution permits public colleges and universities to take account of race in admissions decisions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 2013, in a short, vague compromise ruling in the case, the court refused to decide whether the admissions plan at the University of Texas at Austin \u2014 which combines race-neutral and race-conscious tools to achieve diversity \u2014 is constitutional. The court\u2019s return to the subject after an appeals court sustained the hybrid plan has struck many supporters of affirmative action as an ominous sign. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The case was brought by the Project on Fair Representation, a small conservative advocacy group that successfully mounted a challenge to the Voting Rights Act in 2013. The group is also behind this term\u2019s most important case on voting, Evenwel v. Abbott, No. 14-940, which asks the court to address the meaning of \u201cone person, one vote.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The court has never resolved whether state voting districts should have the same number of people, including unauthorized immigrants, children and others not eligible to vote, or the same number of voters. Allowing states to count only voters would in many parts of the country shift political power from cities to rural areas, a move that would generally benefit Republicans. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On the last day of the term in June, Justices Breyer and Ginsburg announced that they had grave doubts about the constitutionality of the death penalty and seemed to invite a broad challenge. It has not yet arrived, and it is hardly clear that a majority would be receptive to such a challenge. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The new term does have an unusually high number of capital cases presenting more focused issues, including a challenge to Florida\u2019s sentencing scheme, Hurst v. Florida, No. 14-7505, and a case on race discrimination in jury selection, Foster v. Chatman, No. 14-8349. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The court has not heard an abortion case since 2007, when it upheld the federal Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act. That seems about to change. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The most likely candidate is a challenge to a Texas law that threatens to reduce the number of abortion clinics in the state to about 10, down from more than 40. Should the court agree to hear the case, Whole Woman\u2019s Health Center v. Cole, No. 15-274, it is likely to produce the most important abortion ruling since 1992, when Planned Parenthood v. Casey reaffirmed the constitutional right to abortion identified in Roe v. Wade in 1973. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement Continue reading the main story NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The question in the Texas case is whether two parts of a 2013 state law imposed an \u201cundue burden\u201d on the constitutional right to abortion. One part of the law requires all clinics in the state to meet the standards for \u201cambulatory surgical centers,\u201d including regulations concerning buildings, equipment and staffing. The other requires doctors performing abortions to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An appeals court largely upheld the contested provisions, but the Supreme Court in June, by a 5-to-4 vote, stepped in to block the ruling while it considered whether to hear the case. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That suggests three things: that the court is likely to hear the case, that its decision will be closely divided and that the ruling will land in June, thrusting a volatile and divisive issue into the middle of the presidential race. ||||| WASHINGTON\u2014The death penalty is shaping up to be a big issue for the Supreme Court as it begins a new term Monday, with at least six capital-punishment cases on the docket and a recent wave of executions keeping the justices up late to field last-minute appeals.

        "summary": "\u2013 The Supreme Court is facing a docket of high-profile political cases that will test whether recent liberal victories were more fluke or firm conviction, the New York Times reports. The court\u2014which is divided 5-4 for conservatives, but saw Justice Roberts vote liberal on Obamacare and same-sex marriage\u2014will look at cases including unions, affirmative action, and possibly abortion. A primer: Unions: Since 1977, unions have been allowed to charge non-union workers for dues that go to collective bargaining efforts, but not political ones. Now California teachers have brought a case saying collective bargaining is itself political. \"It could set the stage for a Citizens United-style reconsideration in the area of union dues,\" a lawyer says. Affirmative Action: Abigail Fisher says that being white played a role in the University of Texas denying her admission back in 2008. The Supreme Court punted on her case in 2013, and now it's back on the docket. Like the unions case, this was brought by a conservative group that recruited the plaintiffs. The death penalty: Justices will decide on capital-punishment cases in Pennsylvania, Kansas, Georgia, and Florida, the Wall Street Journal reports. Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer have already expressed doubts about whether capital punishment is constitutional. \"One person, one vote\": Should state legislative districts be drawn based on their number of people or eligible voters? If justices choose the latter\u2014leaving out immigrants and children\u2014Latinos could lose political clout and rural areas will gain, Politico reports. Abortion: Justices may opt to revisit a Texas law that could reduce the state's abortion clinics from more than 40 to roughly 10. At issue is whether new clinic requirements are an \"undue burden\" on women's right to an abortion. One commentator believes this Supreme Court session will be ugly for liberals.\n"

(credit: Adam Woodward) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEW YORK (CBSNewYork) \u2014 A preservationist says he has found evidence that a Manhattan building is the former site of an 18th-century tavern where George Washington is believed to have enjoyed a celebratory drink during the American Revolution. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If it is indeed the home of the legendary watering hole, the discovery could mean that the building that is perhaps Manhattan\u2019s oldest is slated to demolished. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cAfter the English had marched up the Bowery and out of the city (in 1783), George Washington and Governor (George) Clinton stopped at the Bull\u2019s Head (tavern),\u201d preservationist Adam Woodward told WCBS 880\u2019s Alex Silverman.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The building at 50 Bowery, which has had many faces since, is being prepared for demolition so a hotel can be built at the site. Legend had it that \u201cthe Bull\u2019s Head\u2019s structure, cellar, bones\u201d were still inside, Woodward said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He decided to poke around and, in the basement, Woodward found what he believes are Colonial-era, hand-hewn and hand-planed joists and foundation walls. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cFound myself in what I am pretty certain is the 1750s historic tavern,\u201d he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Woodward said he felt compelled to investigate in the building, which once housed a chain drugstore and the Atlantic Garden beer garden, because time was running out. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cI just realized that it would be the last chance to solve one of the great mysteries of New York City history,\u201d he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cIt was pretty incredible walking back in time 250 years.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Historian and author David Freeland told Silverman that the find \u201cwould make it very likely the oldest building remaining in Manhattan.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That has Woodward hoping city officials will act quickly to preserve the site. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cWhat an incredible opportunity that the city suddenly has for this thing to re-emerge,\u201d he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR You May Also Be Interested In These Stories ||||| Photo NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Maybe George Washington slept there, or maybe he only watered his horse and ordered stronger stuff for himself. Either way, David Freeland sounded excited as he crossed the threshold where a famous Colonial-era tavern, the Bull\u2019s Head, once welcomed thirsty out-of-towners. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThere are treasures inside,\u201d said Mr. Freeland, an author and a historian who researched the site for a book about a beer garden that later occupied the tavern\u2019s place on the Bowery. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Photo NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But all he saw was debris from the building\u2019s most recent life, as a chain drugstore with a Chinese restaurant upstairs. He did not reach the treasures that thrilled local-history aficionados over the weekend \u2014 namely, some old-looking joists and foundation walls in the basement \u2014 because the steps were blocked by rubble. The site is to be cleared for a hotel. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The joists were discovered by a photographer and preservationist, Adam Woodward, who suspects that structural elements of the Colonial-era tavern were used in the construction of the much larger beer hall, the Atlantic Garden. It reigned as \u201cone of the show places of New York\u201d from 1858 on, The New York Times said when it finally shut down in 1911. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But what about the tavern where Washington established his temporary headquarters in November 1783 as the British withdrew? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThe whole issue of whether the Bull\u2019s Head was buried inside the Atlantic Garden was one of the great mysteries of New York,\u201d Mr. Woodward said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Until, apparently, the other day, when he got a look inside. He saw iron work from the 19th century and I-beams from later on. And then he saw a stairway to the basement, and headed down. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cAt one point there was a distinct change in the building material, from cinder block to a brick-and-stone foundation wall,\u201d he said. \u201cI followed that wall and found myself at the front of the building, under the sidewalk at the Bowery, and looked up and saw what looked to me like 18th-century hand-hewn and hand-planed joists and beams with extremely wide floorboards right above them.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He said, \u201cI was thinking, I am standing in the cellar of the Bull\u2019s Head.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Bull\u2019s Head opened around 1750 on the fringe of what was a still-young city concentrated below the Bowery. Washington and his troops marched down the Bowery and stopped there in 1783 before making \u201ctheir official entrance into the city proper,\u201d said Kerri Culhane, a historian who wrote the application that won the Bowery a place on the National Register of Historic Places. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The neighborhood \u201cwas a butchers\u2019 district in the 18th century and the 19th century,\u201d Ms. Culhane said. \u201cPeople drove livestock down from the hinterland and the slaughterhouse was behind the Bowery. That\u2019s where the trading took place.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It was also a home to the ancestors of future V.I.P.\u2019s. \u201cThe Astors started out as butchers,\u201d she said, but began snapping up land. They even owned the Bull\u2019s Head site. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But the tavern closed. Mr. Freeland wrote that the building became a store that sold stoves until the Atlantic Garden opened as a beer garden. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It was a popular gathering place for German immigrants in its early days, and in the 1870s and 1880s, the Atlantic Garden was raided repeatedly for selling beer on Sundays, when the city\u2019s excise laws appeared to forbid that. Mr. Freeland noted that the laws did not mention beer, only \u201cintoxicating liquors or wines.\u201d The Atlantic Garden\u2019s owner got off after one raid because the judge sampled the beer the police had seized and complained it was so watered down that \u201ca man might drink by the gallon without getting drunk.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Later still, the Atlantic Garden became \u201ca place where Tin Pan Alley songwriters would go to plug their songs,\u201d Mr. Freeland said. One tune that apparently got its start there in the 1890s was \u201cDaisy Bell,\u201d the song that turned the phrase \u201cbicycle built for two\u201d into a catchphrase. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Woodward said he hoped the demolition for the hotel could be delayed long enough for \u201ca proper archaeological exploration.\u201d (Calls to the owner were not returned on Monday.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cI can\u2019t think of another lot in Manhattan that has a more important history,\u201d Mr. Woodward said, \u201cand the fact that it might be intact, a couple of feet under the building, is an incredible opportunity to get on archaeological record.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ||||| Elected officials and the Landmarks Preservation Commission are both doing their best to launch a thorough investigation of what may very well be the famed 18th century saloon the Bull's Head Tavern, but their options are limited. Photographer Adam Woodward first documented the ancient, hand-planed wood joists and stone foundation in the basement of 50 Bowery last week, and both he and historian David Freeland are convinced that these are the remnants of Bull's Head. If so, this would be the oldest surviving structure in Manhattan by far, and as Woodward puts it, an \"incredible opportunity to get on archaeological record.\" But the fate of the site depends on the current owner, Alex Chu, who is demolishing the site to make way for a new hotel. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Landmarks Commission tells The Lo-Down that they're \"aware of the situation,\" but \"cannot require the owner to conduct archaeology.\" The best they can do is give the owner a list of good archaeologists.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR DUBAI (Reuters) - The incursion by an unmanned aircraft into Israeli airspace at the weekend exposed the weakness of Israeli air defenses, an Iranian military official was quoted as saying on Monday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Israeli air force shot down a drone on Saturday after it crossed into southern Israel, the military said, but it remained unclear where the aircraft had come from. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jamaluddin Aberoumand, deputy coordinator for Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, said the incident indicated that Israel's Iron Dome anti-missile defense system \"does not work and lacks the necessary capacity\", Fars news agency reported. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Iron Dome system, jointly funded with the United States, is designed to shoot down short-range guerrilla rockets, not slow-flying aircraft. It intercepted more than 80 percent of the targets it engaged in March when nearly 300 rockets and mortars were fired at southern Israel, the Pentagon said at the time. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The drone was first spotted above the Mediterranean near the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip to the west of Israel, said military spokeswoman Avital Leibovich. An Israeli warplane shot it down above a forest near the occupied West Bank. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Israeli parliament member Miri Regev, a former chief spokesman of the military, wrote on Twitter it was an \"Iranian drone launched by Hezbollah\", referring to the Lebanese Shi'ite group that fought a war with Israel in 2006. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Israeli defense officials have not confirmed this. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Aberoumand attributed claims the drone was made by Iran to a \"psychological operation\" by Israel, but did not confirm or deny them. \"The Zionist regime (Israel) has many enemies,\" he added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On at least one occasion, Iranian-backed Hezbollah has sent a drone into Israeli airspace.

Hospital sources in Gaza said Makawi died of his wounds. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The armed wing of Hamas, the Islamists who control the Gaza Strip, said it had joined in Monday's rocket attack along with the smaller Islamic Jihad group. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gaza has been under the control of Hamas since 2007. The Islamist group rejects permanent peace with Israel and the two sides fought a three-week war in December-January 2008-2009. The border is tense, with frequent clashes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Israeli army says over 470 rockets have been fired from Gaza this year, but it was the first time since June that Hamas had acknowledged launching rockets at Israel. A Hamas spokesman said the movement would not remain passive in the face of what it called \"one-sided\" Israeli violence. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Israeli army said it had targeted \"Hamas terror activity sites and terrorist squads responsible for the rocket fire\", but gave no details. Israeli forces say they will not tolerate such attacks and will hold Hamas responsible for them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gaza hospital officials said one Islamic Jihad militant thought to have been involved in the rocket attack had been wounded by Israeli tank fire east of the town of Rafah. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Residents of Khan Younis in southern Gaza said an Israeli tank fired at the suspected launch area, slightly wounding four children and damaging a minaret and a water tower. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Abu Ubaida, spokesman of the Hamas armed wing Izz El-Deen Al-Qassam Brigades, said the rocket firing was a message to Israel that it would not accept \"a formula of a one-sided aggression by the occupation on flimsy pretexts\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With Egyptian mediation, Hamas has made efforts in the past to clamp down on smaller militant groups that persist in mounting attacks on Israel, partly in order to avoid another devastating war. The Israeli offensive in the winter of 2009 killed more than 1,000 Palestinians.

        "summary": "\u2013 A dispute over the freshness of Wendy\u2019s fries leaves a 25-year-old Minnesota woman facing criminal charges. According to CBS Minnesota, Wendy's employees claim that Eiram Chanel Amir Dixson became argumentative during a drive-thru transaction just after noon Thursday after the woman asked specifically for fresh French fries. Reports don't specify the condition of the fries, or whether she even received them, but do make clear that an argument followed. Employees allege Dixson reached through the drive-thru window and, after an employee threw a soft drink at her, proceeded to spray them with Mace. The restaurant manager was hit directly in the face while two more employees were also in the line of the spray, per the police report. All three employees provided similar accounts of the incident, according to ABC News 5. Dixson is being charged with felony use of tear gas to immobilize. If found guilty, she\u2019ll face a maximum sentence of up to five years in prison and/or a $3,000 to $10,000 fine. Wendy\u2019s drive-thrus see their share of action: last year, a worker was allegedly bit over a wrong order in Virginia, while a Florida man reportedly threw an alligator through a drive-thru window as a prank.\n"
