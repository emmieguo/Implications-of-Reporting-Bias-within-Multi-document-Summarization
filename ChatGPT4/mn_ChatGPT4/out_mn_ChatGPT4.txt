Voters in 11 states are casting their votes to elect governors, with Republicans poised to make gains. Currently, the GOP holds 29 governorships, Democrats 20, and Rhode Island has an independent governor. Key competitive races are in Montana, New Hampshire, and Washington, all without incumbent Democratic governors. The North Carolina governorship is expected to switch from Democratic to Republican control, while the GOP is likely to maintain seats in Utah, North Dakota, and Indiana. Democrats anticipate retaining their seats in West Virginia and Missouri, with probable victories in Vermont and Delaware. Governors are expected to have significant influence over health care, especially following a Supreme Court decision allowing states to opt out of Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act. This power has been compared to the states' response to federal stimulus for high-speed rail in 2010, where some Republican governors rejected the funds due to fiscal concerns. A victory for Mitt Romney in the presidential race would further empower Republican governors. In individual state races, Republican Pat McCrory leads in North Carolina over incumbent Democrat Beverly Perdue. In Montana, Democrat Steve Bullock is competing to succeed popular Democratic Governor Brian Schweitzer. New Hampshire's race features former Democratic State Senator Maggie Hassan against Tea Party conservative Ovide Lamontagne. Washington sees a tight race between former U.S. Rep. Jay Inslee and Republican Attorney General Rob McKenna. Incumbent Democrats in Vermont and Delaware, and Republican candidates in North Dakota, Utah, and Indiana are expected to win easily. Missouri and West Virginia also see Democrats favored to retain the governorships.

The article discusses a controversy surrounding a photo of two men kissing that was posted on Facebook. The image, a still from the British soap opera "Eastenders," depicted character Christian Clarke and another male character. It gained attention as it was broadcast before the UK watershed, leading to complaints to the BBC. The photo was used to promote a "gay kiss-in" event in London, protesting a pub's ejection of a same-sex couple for kissing. Initially, it was thought that Facebook removed the event page for the John Snow Kiss-In, but it was clarified that the event creator, Paul Shetler, made it private post-event to avoid abusive comments. There was confusion in the media about the involvement of Richard Metzger, who clarified he was not the organizer and had only questioned whether Facebook removed the post from his wall. Facebook admitted that the removal of the photo was an error, stating it did not violate their policies. The incident sparked a response from people posting their own pictures of same-sex couples kissing in protest. This situation highlights issues around social media content moderation, LGBTQ+ rights, and public reactions to displays of same-sex affection.

Residents in Siskiyou County, a rural area in Northern California, are expressing frustration with Sacramento's regulations and the political influence of Southern California. As a result, the Siskiyou County Board of Supervisors voted 4-1 to pursue seceding from California. The proposal suggests forming a new state named Jefferson, which would include other like-minded counties in Northern California and Southern Oregon. The movement for secession stems from a range of issues, including a perceived lack of representation in the state capital, water rights concerns, and a rural fire prevention fee. Supporters of the declaration argue that local governance would better understand and address their specific needs. The concept of Jefferson as a new state resonates with many residents, as demonstrated by the overwhelming show of support at a recent meeting where nearly every attendee indicated favor for the split. However, Supervisor Ed Valenzuela voted against the declaration, citing his oath to uphold the California Constitution and a commitment to working within the existing system. Other neighboring counties are also considering similar secession movements. Humboldt County officials have expressed understanding and partial agreement with Siskiyou County's grievances but have noted the economic challenges and practicalities of forming a new state. The push for secession reflects deep-seated regional frustrations and the complexities of representing diverse interests within a single state governance structure.

The articles present two main themes: the challenges faced by Nokia and Microsoft in the smartphone market, and Microsoft's acquisition of Nokia's cell phone business. Nokia's decline in the smartphone market is starkly portrayed. Once a dominant player, Nokia's market share and innovation were significantly undercut by competitors like Apple and Android. Nokia's failure to adapt quickly to the smartphone revolution, along with missed opportunities and internal issues, led to its dramatic fall. This is symbolized by the story of a man on a "burning platform" facing a critical decision, used by Stephen Elop to describe Nokia's urgent need for change. On the other hand, Microsoft has been transitioning towards a devices and services strategy, aiming to move away from traditional services and embrace the burgeoning smartphone and tablet markets. The acquisition of Nokia is a strategic move to accelerate this transition. Microsoft aims to integrate services and brands like Windows, Nokia, Xbox, and Bing into a cohesive user experience, while facing the challenge of uniting various services and maintaining relationships with manufacturers and business customers. Analysts see the Microsoft-Nokia deal as a potentially positive step for Microsoft in the long term, allowing for deeper integration and a stronger position in the mobile market. However, they also acknowledge the risks and challenges, such as achieving significant market share and successfully competing against established players like iOS and Android. The overarching narrative is one of two tech giants, Microsoft and Nokia, attempting to reclaim their relevance and competitive edge in a rapidly evolving and highly competitive smartphone market.

In the upcoming Supreme Court term, several high-stakes cases could potentially lead to significant shifts in U.S. law and policy, particularly favoring conservative positions. Key issues include the potential weakening of public sector labor unions, a reevaluation of affirmative action in higher education, and the heated debate over abortion rights and regulations. One of the most closely watched cases is Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association, which challenges the mandatory payment of union dues by public employees. The outcome could critically impact the financial strength of public-employee unions. Another important case revisits the constitutionality of the University of Texas at Austin's affirmative action program, potentially affecting racial and ethnic diversity in public colleges. The court is also likely to tackle issues around state-imposed abortion clinic regulations, which could drastically reduce the number of abortion clinics and impact women's access to abortion services. Additionally, cases involving the rights of religious institutions under Obamacare, particularly regarding contraception coverage, are expected to be heard. There's also a focus on the "one person, one vote" principle in Evenwel v. Abbott, questioning whether legislative districts should be apportioned based on total population or eligible voters, which could shift political power and impact Latino representation. Lastly, the death penalty is a prominent theme, with at least six cases on the docket addressing various aspects of capital punishment, including the constitutionality of capital sentences in multiple states. These cases come at a time when the ideological split of the Supreme Court mirrors partisan divisions, making the outcomes especially consequential in the context of the upcoming 2016 presidential election. With several older justices potentially nearing retirement, the next president's appointments could shape the court and its decisions for generations. The decisions made in this term will not only affect immediate legal practices but also set the stage for broader political and social debates.

Preservationists and historians have stumbled upon what could be a groundbreaking historical discovery in Manhattan. Adam Woodward, a preservationist, and David Freeland, a historian, have identified remnants in the basement of 50 Bowery that they believe to be the remains of the Bullâ€™s Head Tavern, a legendary 18th-century establishment. If confirmed, this site could represent the oldest surviving structure in Manhattan. The Bull's Head Tavern, dating back to around 1750, is of historical significance due to its association with notable figures like George Washington and its role in the early butchering trade of the city. The site later evolved into the Atlantic Garden, a popular beer garden for German immigrants, and was frequented by Tin Pan Alley songwriters in the late 19th century. Unfortunately, the building currently at 50 Bowery is slated for demolition to make way for a new hotel. While elected officials and the Landmarks Preservation Commission are interested in investigating this potential historic site further, their influence is limited. They cannot mandate a historical site survey or archaeological investigation, and the fate of the site ultimately rests with the current owner, Alex Chu. Woodward and Freeland urge that the demolition be delayed for a proper archaeological exploration to fully uncover and record the site's historical significance. However, without legal jurisdiction to enforce this, there is a risk that this potentially invaluable historical site could be lost in the rush to redevelop. This discovery has sparked interest and concern among those who value New York City's rich historical heritage.

In the first incident, the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) reported shooting down an unidentified drone after it entered southern Israeli airspace on October 6, 2012. Iranian military official Jamaluddin Aberoumand commented on the incident, suggesting it exposed weaknesses in Israel's air defenses, specifically referencing the Iron Dome anti-missile system. The Iron Dome is designed primarily for intercepting short-range rockets and had a high interception rate during heavy rocket fire in March. The origin of the drone remained unclear, with some speculations about its Iranian connections, but no official confirmation from Israeli defense officials. In the second incident, Israel conducted air strikes in the Gaza Strip in response to rockets fired by Palestinian militants. This action was a retaliation to an earlier Israeli air strike which killed a militant linked to a Sinai border attack. Hamas and the Islamic Jihad group claimed responsibility for the rocket attacks on Israel. Tensions and frequent clashes have been common along the Gaza-Israel border, and this was the first acknowledgment since June from Hamas of their involvement in rocket attacks. The Israeli army targeted sites and squads responsible for the rocket fire, holding Hamas accountable. The incidents in Gaza led to injuries and damage, and there was a warning of a stronger response if Israeli aggression continued. Both these articles highlight ongoing tensions and security challenges in the Israeli-Gaza context, including the complexities of defense systems and the cyclical nature of retaliatory violence in the region.

A long-lost Pablo Picasso painting, titled "La Coiffeuse" or "The Hairdresser," created in 1911 and valued at over $2.5 million, has been recovered by U.S. customs authorities after being missing for over a decade. The painting was stolen from a storeroom at the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris in 2001 and was recently found in a FedEx shipment from Belgium to Newark, falsely labeled as a $37 "art craft/toy" with "Joyeux Noel" (Merry Christmas) written on the shipping papers. Upon discovery by U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials, the Department of Homeland Security took over the investigation. French museum officials later confirmed the authenticity of the painting during a visit to New York. U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch stated, "A lost treasure has been found," and a civil complaint was filed to forfeit the painting and return it to France. The Pompidou Centre in Paris, where the painting was initially housed, expressed hope to display the recovered artwork in May. This recovery was seen as particularly significant and a source of comfort at a time when the cultural world was reeling from the destruction of historical artifacts by the Islamic State. The incident highlights the ongoing issues surrounding art theft and the illegal antiquities market.
