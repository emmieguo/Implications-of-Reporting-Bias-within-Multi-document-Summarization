        "document": "A fascinating exercise in historical fill-in-the-blanks.the story of how a fascist dictator was overthrown by dopey TV commercialsAn expansive political thriller.Bernal plays the creative type perfectly. His big eyes always seem to be seeing things that others don't, and through his calm, methodical demeanor, you can sense the wheels turning in his head.The story of it, while true to the moment, needed - ironically - much more dynamism.\"No\" signals a huge spurt in the filmmaker's growth.Starring Gael Garcia Bernal, the third, fact-based panel in Larrain's political films about the Pinochet regime, is just as riveting as the previous ones.For anyone fascinated by the political process and the powers of persuasive advertising, No is a resounding yes.It's a perfectly fine movie, but given its fairly radical storyline, the filmmaking tends to hew toward the safe and the familiar.\"No\" gives a fresh look at the little known history of a country whose duly elected government under Salvador Allende was overthrown in a military coup led by Pinochet in 1973.A troubling, exhilarating and ingeniously realized film that's part stirring political drama and part devilish media satire ...Say yes to \"No.\"[Lorrain has] made a few daring choices here, not all of which work.Larra\u00edn's unarguable point is that, in politics, if we wait for good to issue only from the pure in heart, we will be waiting a very long time.It hangs on three ideas...While each...is intriguing, the execution of all is less than satisfying.Nominated by the Academy as the year's best foreign-language film, No grabs you hard, no mercy, and keeps you riveted.It makes the superficial Mad Men seem like, well, a commercial. Buy, buy, buy.Larra\u00edn's script is punctuated by dark bursts of humour, and the filmmaker knowingly navigates his audience to a nail-biting - though never cloying, and fully warranted - climax.Evocative and suspenseful, the film is a fascinating glimpse into recent history and the democratic process.A fascinating period re-creation if not an especially compelling drama.Using a technique borrowed from cinema verit\u00e9 documentaries, the director succeeds in making us feel as if we're living each moment right alongside his politically-charged characters.The film highlights the sad fact that logical arguments don't win political debates or elections. Sloganeering and advertising do.A decisive transitional chapter in Chilean history yields an absorbing account of one country's unlikely route from oppression to democracyA hearty celebration of hard-earned democracy spiked with just enough of the director's acidly crooked humor to remind us whose house we're in.Larrain's bizarre decision to make his film blend in with its extensive passages of archive footage by shooting in U-matic - the default TV production format of the 1980s - makes for an uncomfortable cinematic viewing experience.The film provides a fascinating history lesson in the guise of backstage drama, honeycombed with antique-looking TV commercials full of Lycra-clad dancers and gambolling mimes.Larra\u00edn has serious form, and his film is at once worthy, skilfully made and hugely entertaining.The standout entry of the Directors' Fortnight sidebar and the closest thing to a masterpiece that I've seen so far here in Cannes.Tense throughout, even for history-savvy auds, but still rich in the sort of Andean-soil-black humor that made Larrain's previous work so distinctive.\"No\" is an ugly looking movie - literally - for an ugly time. It's smeary, with little pictorial beauty or detail, but its anti-aesthetic is purposeful and, after your eyes stop hurting, watchable and persuasive.A resounding yes.No, sadly, is a no-no from Chile's Pablo Larra\u00edn.The clash of ideas is fascinating because they boil down to what makes us human: are we driven by hope or fear?It's engaging and inventive, although the deliberately distressed video quality of the film can be hard on the eyes.For his third Pinochet-era movie, Chilean filmmaker Larrain has come up with his most breathtakingly original approach yet, telling a story anyone, anywhere can identify with while at the same time never pulling his political punches.A fascinating case study in basic-level democracy.No is hugely smart and intricate, but it also comes from the gut.A terrific and thrilling drama about the power of hope, of optimism, and of bravery in the face of intimidation, and very real and extreme physical danger.Initially jarring, the video aesthetic blends beautifully with period footage to give a smart depiction of a nation in transition. A well-deserved Oscar nominee.[VIDEO ESSAY] Gael Garcia Bernal's television adman-turned-political-commercial-creator Rene Saavedra is such an ethically ambiguous protagonist that \"No\" falls completely flat as a piece of agitprop cinema.A bitingly funny, fascinating and moving portrait of Pinochet's fall that's smartly shot and superbly performed.\"NO\" is an inspirational political drama in which the people are roused by the visual to overcome the vicious.It works as drama. And strangely, considering we know the outcome, it generates considerable suspense.Despite the light-heartedness, there's a hard, tense edge to the film.Shooting the entire film on video equipment of the era gives No some visual snap but it is very much a pedestrian, by-the-numbers docu-drama tale, with the emphasis on the former rather than the latter.NO is an important film - especially for people too young or too far removed from Pinochet's \"Dirty War\" to remember how horrifying the situation was in Argentina during the '70s and '80s. Bernal's screen presence goes a long way in making the movie workNo reminds us that wherever \"freedom\" must be sold to the public, a history of complacency, violence, and terror has to be overcome.Despite a lack of in-depth special features, No is still easy to recommend for its fascinating story that tells of a country getting the unique opportunity to decide its own future.For all its flaws, 'No' succeeds because the marketers sell the audience, too.... like Mad Men, it's a period piece set in the world of advertising and it pays a distracting (and sometimes humorous) amount of attention to period details.This witty, double-edged movie is no ordinary exercise in political cinema.Chilean filmmaker Pablo Larra\u00edn's last in a trilogy of films about his country's political landscape, No is the story of the 1988 national referendum which unseated a dictator.Deftly appropriates mediated history for fiction.Simultaneously uplifting and unsettling.Explores the power of popular dissent, and the coordinated persuasions of media, marketing, and targeted advertising in shaping the word no to invigorate a populace pessimistically conditioned to think that nothing will ever change for the good.Largely a gimmick picture: At all times, it looks like hastily assembled news footage shot on grainy videotape in 1988.The most unexpectedly riotous comedy in years -- one with more bite than usual.'No' is never a drag to watch, but paradoxically enough, its self-imposed cinematic restraints inhibit it from selling itself as effectively as it might have.It has its dull patches but manages to show with some flair both the awfulness of the Pinochet regime and how Chileans rose against it.An alluring lead performance from Bernal and a suitably low-key, almost purring soundtrack composed by Carlos CabezasLast of a trilogy of films about Chilean politics, told through the story of an ad man using positive images to persuade voters to reject a dictator.This exquisitely assembled film, driven by Larrain's pin-sharp direction and Bernal's rousing performance, turns a potentially dry subject into something uproariously funny and massively involving.Savvy, often brilliant ...A singular biopic and a snapshot of a society renewed, No unaffectedly celebrates faith in democracy, and, surprisingly, truth in advertising.\"We have to find a product that's appealing to people!\" says Garcia Bernal at one point. And that's just what Larra\u00edn's created with this Latin spin on Mad Men.Neatly combines political conflict with marketing satire to form a vivid look at the 1988 plebiscite that overthrew Chile's dictator Augusto PinochetDirector Pablo Larrain clearly wishes neither to sentimentalise the past, nor excoriate it with cynical satire; but this trepidation leaves his film feeling indecisive.This battle and this triumph of an ad executive makes NO the first great film of 2013, and Bernal's performance the one that will be the hardest to outshine.A cunning and richly enjoyable combination of high-stakes drama and media satire from Chilean director Pablo Larrain.No continually impresses for its slyness and savvy -- rarely has such an eyesore been so worth watching.A reflection of a moment in time, made in the image of that moment.Bernal deftly explores the layers of the character's complexity, including his political apathy.It's clear that the language of advertising has become universal, and that political commodities can be sold like soap. But toppling a dictatorship? Now there's a story.\"No\" is a picture that perches precariously on the cusp of a paradox.A canny comedy and cutting critique, Pablo Larra\u00edn's No looks back at the 1980 vote to extend or end Chilean autocrat Augusto Pinochet's rule through an adman's eyes.Freshens up a decades-old story with vibrant humor and a good sense of storytelling.\"No\" is filmmaking of the first order.Old technology plus the packaging of a revolution add up to a Yes...a bitter and knowing meditation on media manipulation and political subversion.An extremely perceptive and intriguing examination of the effect that media hype and spin have on the political process.All historical and little drama.Larrain deftly mixes social satire and historical drama.No is a great historical document as to how one very important revolution started with a commercial.... features a fine performance by Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal as young ad exec Ren\u00e9 Saavedra, who didn't, at first, quite realise what he was in for when he decided to assist in the bringing down of military dictator Augusto Pinochet.It's not easy material but it's truly fascinating, and expertly done.The understated performance by Bernal was inspiring, as was the pic.Silliness is on the side of the angels in a brilliant and highly entertaining film that's part political thriller, part media satire.Larrain does a fine job of making No look and sound authentic to its time period, although the VHS-quality photography, all washed-out with colors bleeding together as camcorders did in the '80s, is an occasional irritant.This is probably the best fact-based account of 1980s Chilean political advertising that I've seen this year.It features an enormously appealing lead performance by Gael Garcia Bernal, an impressively even-handed approach, and a dynamic visual gimmick.Larra\u00edn shows how idealism and venality sat side by side, how quickly the brutal circumstances in which Pinochet came to power were forgotten and how little seemed to change once he left.Gripping and suspenseful even though the ending is already known.The most cutting gag is just how much Saavedra's political ads resemble his recent campaign for a diet cola. And the punch line is that they work.No is an open conversation about the very means by which we understand ourselves and our societies, the way that we internalize advertising and news footage. It's a manifestation of national memory.[Director Pablo] Larrain has substituted the icy-veined harshness of his earlier films and replaced it with a celebratory, robust, truly cinematic sensibility.Writer-director Pablo Larra\u00edn includes much authentic footage from the 'No' and 'Yes' campaign ads, and adopts a complementary 1980s TV-video design.The best movie ever made about Chilean plebiscites, No thoroughly deserves its Oscar nomination for Best Foreign Film.An incredible and prescient real life story of how a savvy ad campaign brought about real political change.If there are fewer white-knuckle showdowns than in a Hollywood movie, the trade-off is a cool, ironic intelligence that ripples off the screen and up the years to where we live.It's a fascinating and surprisingly fun look behind the scenes of politics and media.\"No\" stands proudly in a select sub-category of historical fiction films that work, completely and satisfyingly, as their own movies.Garc\u00eda Bernal quietly carries this film as a soft-spoken kid in blue jeans and untucked shirt.An Oscar-nominated win for more than just political junkies.A worthy and a quite interesting slice of modern international history ...\"No\" isn't nearly as definitive or declarative as its title: It leaves viewers wondering whether they should cheer, shrug or shake their heads.There will have to be a hell of a lot of good movies released in 2013 for No not to make my list of the year's 10 best.It always retains a level of interest, especially for those of us who don't remember - or aren't old enough to remember - which side won.Paranoia mixes neatly with optimism in this dramedy about the ad campaign that made Chile democratic.Stirring as a celebration of voter empowerment, No may also inspire pangs of wistful nostalgia.A political drama, a personal drama, a sharp-eyed study of how the media manipulate us from all sides, No reels and ricochets with emotional force.Larrain fashions an unlikely crowd-pleaser from a historical episode that has its share of tragedy as well as triumph.A mesmerizing, realistic and often hilarious look at the politics of power and the power of ideas ...It's a funny look at the way the media warp public opinion, and a curiously hopeful one.Wildly colorful strokes, full of bitter humor.Swims upstream against high-definition with a defiantly lo-fi approach that's also ingeniously evocative of the historical period.Fascinating work from director Pablo Larrain and screenwriter Pedro Peirano, who manage to slip into the skin of a beleaguered country and detail the urgency of a revolution, sold one jingle at a time.If you can shake off the inherent grossness of mining the Pinochet years for yet another Mad Man-style deification of zeitgeist-grasping salesmen, this is moderately interesting stuff.On every level, \"No\" leaves one with bittersweet feelings about democracy, love and the cost of compromise.",

        "document": "What performances!Damon's portrayal adds a complex level of moral conflict.Although the conclusion is satisfying and well developed, the journey itself is the reward.You'll enjoy the superlative acting of Matt Damon, whose dimensions are tested and found in abundance here far more than they appear in his smaller role in Saving Private Ryan.Colorful performances!Damon, Norton are game, but Rounders script a letdown.When the movie is considering the relationship between the pros and their business, it has a place to go, implying that Mike could turn into one of these bozos.With fine acting all around and a colorful millieu to explore, there's plenty to take in.Rounders is not breakthrough material, but it makes for an entertaining evening out.Rounders is disappointing and fake, because its intentions are predictable as its characters are uninspired.You're going to hear a lot about the good job Edward Norton and Gretchen Mol do in Rounders. But the movie lives and dies with Matt Damon.A smart, lean, star-powered, character-driven melodrama.Mischievously entertaining!Takes you into a grungy underworld of high-stakes poker in New York City.For every good thing about Rounders there is a flaw.[Provides] a lot of entertainment as well as some food for thought.The \"good buddy, bad buddy\" symmetry harkens back to the days of James Cagney-Pat O'Brien pictures, but this is stylish enough to make us forgive the narrative conventions.It's a likable movie and a solid follow up for Damon.The fact that I was so motivated by the movie to put all that money on the table speaks positively of the picture.Other directors simply pay homage to film noir and their movies come across as copies or throwbacks, but Dahl's movies work because he seems to understand the inner workings of film noir, and the absurd situations that people can get into.It's too bad with all of the poker action there wasn't enough time to establish the relationships between characters.No energy!Rounders' script is pretty shabby going. Well, not shabby, really, just simplistic.Damon proves once again that he's not just a face, and he does wonders with his inner and outer conflicts. Norton is wickedly sleazy as a barely-in-control low life who will undoubtedly end up back in the slammer.Too lightweight!The movie is replete with all kinds of insider lingo that goes a long way toward painting a thoroughly convincing portrait of the gambling world.You're going to have an interesting evening.Matt Damon anchors Rounders with another rock solid performance.\"Rounders\" makes you feel the suspense and thrive in the thrill of the moment, always coming up aces.The end result is still short of a winning hand, since the screenplay is so utterly predictable.Intermittently engaging but dramatically slack.This ode to the allure of clipping suckers and psyching out the competition is richly atmospheric but thin in the character department.Gretchen Mol, Edward Norton, John Turturro, Martin Landau, and Famke Janssen costar; they're all pretty good, but not good enough to make this 1998 feature worth seeing.In his first non-noir film, John Dahl, assisted by the great French lenser Jean-Yves Escoffier, gives New York's underground gambling scene a vivid atmopshere, with special attention to its particular rituals and fast macho talk.John Dahl's film is not as sinister or complex as its cinematic cousin, House of Games, but it is fun to see these young Hollywood studs (Damon, Edward Norton, Gretchen Mol) strut their stuff.Although featuring a splendid Edward Norton performance, 'Rounders' comes across as too unbelievable, often straying beyond the bounds of rationality.John Dahl creates an intelligent and character-driven crime-drama built around solid performances by Damon and Norton.The wholesome pup's poker face alone, however, hardly accounts for the film's failure to thrill. Damon's character doesn't really have that much stake in the story's outcome.Interesting but uneven.After you get over Malkovich's Oreo-eating, lisping Russian Mafia guy and John Turturro's work-a-day mug, Rounders leaves a smarmy hand on the table.Rounders has little trouble maintaining our interest, it's just that the stakes are disappointingly meager.The glimpse into an exotic, edgy world is absorbing and the performances of Damon, Norton and Landau are rewarding, despite the shaky credibility of their characters' relationships.Not a full house by any means....flat on substance, poor on relationships, big on predictability, and slow getting anywhere.A disappointing mediocrity.Norton's acting and Dahl's gift for sustaining a tone save Rounders from completely floundering.It's a movie of character and milieu, both of which it evokes brilliantly.A great cast, terrific screenplay and a director with a muscular sense of atmosphere and film mechanics help make the card-shark character-drama 'Rounders' a winner.The acting is crisp, and Dahl knows how to pace a movie and make it look good.This film tries to be The Hustler and ends up being The Color of Money, unfortunately.Worthwhile entertainment.Seductively savvy [and] suspense-filled.This film is never more exciting and engrossing when characters are engaging in a tough game of poker, with the stakes reaching as high as they can possibly go, smoke teeming from everywhere, and cool jazz music underscoring everything.A sure bet!It's still a smart and interesting picture.Rounders has its strengths, to be sure, but for all its polish it never manages to strike the heart.Rounders is less about how the cards are dealt than how people deal with the situations the cards create, and will hook you from beginning to end.Rounders is another nice notch in Damon's belt and an excellent commercial for Oreos, but its destiny lies as a dust collector on the video store shelves.In fighting to show the psychological complexities in Mike that the script ignores, Damon plays it like a rounder instead of a grinder. This kid still has surprises up his sleeve.The struggles of a young man to find his true calling.O filme possui o m\u00e9rito de n\u0103o tentar justificar a moral de seus personagens.This is an intelligent, absorbing movie that really pulled me in.Though Damon is an actor who's flatly impossible not to root for, the longer this film lasts the less patience we have to stay with him.It's rare that a movie lacking so much in logic and characterization is such fun to watch.Rounders cheerfully buys into compulsive gambling!This tale shows us a different world entirely -- the world of card-player as tortured artist.Though it's a good-looking flick with some smart acting and a few flashy runs, it barely breaks even dramatically, and feels, overall, like a good chance wasted.This is movie's tell, revealing that for all its cultivated effort by a brilliant cast and director, it's still dependent on antiquated screen gimmicks.According to director John Dahl's Rounders, professional poker players are very, very interesting people -- for about five minutes.Damon plays with stacked deck!No big deal!As for the cast, Damon is as personable as always. But it's really Norton, with his weaselly yet still likable turn, and both Landau and John Turturro (in too-brief supporting roles), who bring the film to life.A promising cast can't rescue a script without surprises!",

        "document": "Fanning and Russell make this watchable family entertainment, if not necessarily at today's prices.Please don't shoot the horse with the broken leg, Daddy, Dakota Fanning with her enormous eyes brimming with tears... doesn't exactly say, but she might as well have.Yes, Dreamer follows a formula, but the formula, when applied with skill and intelligence, as it is here, is pretty much foolproof.Crosses the finish line quite a few furlongs behind such classics of the girl-and-her horse genre as National Velvet, Black Stallion or Gypsy Colt.Dreamer: Still Better than SeabiscuitA sweet, solidly constructed family film, Dreamer may be short on surprises, but it has enough heart for ten movies.a chance to see America's little sweetheart, Dakota Fanning, before she turns 16, dyes her blonde hair jet black, and pierces something that shouldn't be piercedThe inspiration comes in spades thanks to solid work from two leads who could sell corn back to the Field of Dreams. Plus, who doesn't love horseys?Still manages to rouse spirits, in spite of everything.I have seen enough movies to know that 'wholesome' does not have to equate to 'unoriginal.' Yet there's not an inventive moment in the entire film.As simple and pretty as a Shaker rocker, Dreamer keeps getting better as it develops its theme about whether it's more important to have dreams or to achieve them.Sure, it's as goopy as Kris Kristofferson is grizzled, but families might find a genuinely warm experience in the simple story of a child following her heart %u2014 especially in the rare moments when we're not told how to feel.A quiet and poignant story.The charismatic Fanning proves she is the best child actress in decades.Screenwriting manuals have taught us that every film is (or should be) a Hero's Journey, but writer-director John Gatins takes that gospel so literally it's hard to know whether to admire his purity or marvel at his lack of imagination.simply feels more professional than most family fareIt is a movie that will captivate children, yes, but it will also capture the hearts of the grown-ups, too.Dreamer is loaded with enough clich\u00e9s and formulas to choke a horse. But truly, it works.All the characters are familiar, the story is familiar, but it is well-constructed and the actors do a good job with the material.Painfully earnest and aggressively sappy, it requires an outrageous suspension of disbelief, and becomes even more far-fetched as it goes along.This is a slow track of wish-fullfillment fantasy and all who come through the turnstiles will wear a happy face.Will entertain its target audience with ease. A wonderfully pleasing family safe film.As yet another underdog/family flick that tugs mercilessly at our heart strings, it just doesn't offer anything new and exciting in this well-worn genre.Solid work by Kurt Russell, Dakota Fanning, Kris Kristofferson and the equally sincere Elisabeth Shue can't win the race against a lame script.Dreamer doesn't try anything new, but has been assembled skillfully and seldom turns corny or silly.It's the performances ... that help elevate Dreamer from merely credible to inspiring.Yeah, it's sappy, but we're buying it.Let the Seabiscuit comparisons begin.Although John Gatins' screenplay is heavy with cliches and stale dialogue, Fanning plays every moment -- comic or tragic -- with perfect pitch.It was incredibly predictable. The characters were cut right out of a template. All the so-called surprises were telegraphed. But I liked it. This time, the formula worked.Most people enjoy a sweet, wholesome movie with an inspiring story; Dreamer is a reminder that those people need not be suckers.A sample of wholesome family entertainment that makes this critic thank God for David Lynch.Has a clich\u00e9 around every turn, but it takes forever to make the turns, lumbering along like an old nag.The plot may be predictable, but 'Dreamer' is utterly irresisitible and definitely worth seeing.The forced family dynamics just drag the movie down.A miasma of mixed messages and exhausted clich\u00e9s shot like a retirement home commercial and scored with an anvil.Dreamer moves slowly and noncommittally, like an ice cream sundae laced with Zoloft.Gatins pushes his way through emotionally manipulative material, but the performances are so appealing that it's easy to abandon cynicism.Watch a beautiful horse serve as a miracle worker for a dysfunctional family devoid of hope.try to fall asleep quickly -- the true story of your very own dreaming is bound to be an improvement over what's on-screen.A case study in how an unrepentant formula picture can be made to seem like it has nothing to be sorry about.An ordinary movie about a girl and her horse, but Dakota Fanning makes the difference.For fleeting moments, this movie about a little girl and her horse becomes one that fathers will know best.A nice film for a father to take his daughter to. Others may find it so by-the-numbers that even high-powered actors (+ a horse) have a hard time breathing life into it.Dakota Fanning, the busiest child actor on the planet it seems, brings her usual maturity to this fine family film. The horse is pretty good too.\"Seabiscuit\" it ain't, but \"Dreamer: Inspired by a True Story\" is one of those harmless horse movies that will entertain the kids.It manages to be a watchable, even enjoyable movie about and for girls, and in our world of candy-coated sparkly pink crap, that's a rare and commendable thing.In short, Dreamer may be shot through with cliches but they're good ones and, more importantly, they work. This is feel-good family entertainment of the first order and if you loved Seabiscuit, you'll love this too.Ah. Here's the family film we've been dreaming of all year long.Mildly pleasant, but never once does it surprise us.Its problems aren't its claims to truth so much as its letdowns to genre.It's precisely what we expect -- no more, no less -- and in that capacity, it is supremely successful.Though generally a formulaic girl-and-her-horse movie, the picture stands out from others of its ilk thanks to a remarkable performance by Dakota Fanning.Save for Dakota Fanning (who is marvelous no matter the role), there isn't a whole lot to enjoy or get involved in.When she speaks about her horse, Fanning can make you believe that no moment like that ever happened before, on or off screen. Now that is breeding.It shows what can be done with overworked and potentially sentimental livestock fodder when everything about the production is first-rate.The predictability of Dreamer makes it more likely to please those predisposed to the story line than to win any new fans to the equine romance genre.The low-key charm of its setting underscores the easygoing performances of a relaxed, well-matched cast.We've seen it all before, but this one is so well made and attractively cast it's a sure crowd pleaser.Some movies about horses take us for exhilarating rides, but Dreamer circles a well-worn trail again and again and doesn't know when to head for the barn.Pure corn--and though Gatins and his cast serve it up as slickly as one could ask, it still comes across as more than a little stale.The best girl-and-horse movie since National Velvet. Who's to say that Dakota Fanning won't have the career longevity of Elizabeth Taylor?As a sports drama -- a genre that's gotten entirely too much play lately -- Dreamer is singularly unexciting.A family film that even adults may enjoy.The film's route to the familiar ending is appealing, largely because Russell and Fanning create such winning father-daughter chemistry, and the theme reverberates with undeniably rousing good spirits.It trampled the curmudgeon right out of me.It's to Fanning's and Russell's credit, and the filmmakers', that the formula never gets the better of the film.There's nothing particularly inspired about the film.Too obvious, too trite and too sentimental to ever be more than Seabiscuit for tweens.Fanning and Russell are a perfect, sweet-and-sour pair. And, of course, the horse is absolutely beautiful -- which, in the end, is what this all comes down to, anyway.It makes a solid case that a wounded horse can heal a wounded family.Charming all-ages entertainment.Lovely family film, which has a way of resonating in one's imagination for days.Seabiscuit-Lite (half the emotional impact and half as satisfying as the regular inspiration film).For family audiences seeking easy assurance, moral certitude and, of course, moving scenes of a gorgeous, galloping horse.Triumphant coming-of-age drama (complete with horses!) [aimed] at little girls and their captive-audience fathers.Gallop, don't walk, to a movie house for one of the most uplifting live-action family films in years.A sugarcube of good intentions that works.The bond between Cale and Sonya changes everyone's lives, including the film's oddest convert, wealthy Prince Sadir (underused Oded Fehr).Despite thoroughbred work from Dakota Fanning, by the time the movie hits the final furlong it's only good for the glue factory.A great family film.High-spirited, sweetly satisfying, it's an inspirational, feel-good family film that's reminiscent of - but not as good as - \"Seabiscuit.\"Bland family fare that goes down easy but neither edifies nor challenges.It is Russell, the workhorse actor of Miracle and the recent Sky High, who gives Dreamer the needed leg up.It canters. It gallops. It clears fences of familiarity with grace. It stands two hands above most flicks bred for families, stirring pleasure at its fine-muscled gait.Has a no-nonsense, forward momentum that keeps it rocketing toward the gate.This family drama wants to do nothing more than tell a story that will make audiences feel good about themselves and about the world in general. Which makes it a refreshing change of pace.Like Seabiscuit, Dreamer is as much about people as horse racing. And that's why it succeeds.Closer to Seabiscuit than to Racing Stripes. For that, you can thank the entire cast of able underplayers, most notably Dakota Fanning.From the first twinkly notes of Americana on the soundtrack to the last freeze-frame voice-over, the movie offers exactly the gooey, homogenized confection it promises -- or almost exactly.Any girl (and a lot of boys) in the target age group are going to make Dreamer one of their favorite films.Modestly engaging but mostly unexceptional.This DreamWorks release recycles just about every sentimental ploy and cliche from a raft of horse racing movies....a well-acted chunk of Velveeta.It's a bit hokey, sure, but it's aimed at hopeful children, not middle-aged cynics.Not particularly inspired or necessarily true, but solid family (read: 7-12 year-olds] entertainment.Viewers will be encouraged to sleep, to dream of better movies.I wonder if the 'true story' Dreamer was 'inspired by' was the one where Seabiscuit made over 120 million dollars at the box-office in 2003?Surprisingly palatable.Despite the formulaic plot, Dreamer stays the course and emerges as a solid family drama that doesn't resort to preciousness.Dreamer does hoe some pretty familiar turf, but thankfully it doesn't husk too much corn.Absolutely solid family entertainment, Dreamer: Inspired by a True Story is corn-fed, wholesome and thoroughly satisfying.Most of what it lacks in originality, it compensates for in spirit, and its success is dependent on the commitment of the actors and the sense of family they evoke.The plot, 'inspired by a true story,' is all but impossible.Whatever its flaws, Dreamer is sure-footed, sure-fire family entertainment.Underdog animal story that comes by its emotions honestly and with few pretensions.A textbook study in cinematic recycling -- everything in it seems to have been borrowed from other movies.This is a lovely film; it's about a million times better than the other so-called children's or family movies out there.Gatins is so worshipful of a child's starry-eyed aspirations that he forgets to ground them in narrative honesty.Treads a well-worn path that will likely feel familiar even to the newest crop of horse-crazy girls.a beautifully made, well acted, old fashioned movie with humor, pathos, and a good premise, highlighted by terrific performances by Kurt Russell and Dakota Fanning.",

Yes, but I liked it too.I went in rooting for SATC with everything I had, and it left me a bit disappointed.Wouldn't it be redundant to describe the self-indulgent big-screen adaptation as similarly vapid, pointless, and poorly acted as the popular HBO show upon which it is based?The behemoth 145-minute running time for this lightweight romantic comedy is unforgivable, and that's only the first of this movie's problems.Reliving the fantasy lush life....'Yes,' she said. 'It's Star Trek for women.'...The movie Sex and the City is a heady female fantasy -- I think. I tried to snuggle up to Sex and the City, but the attempt to snuggle for two hours and 20 minutes is in itself a fantasy. Like many typical men, I'm afraid I fell asleep.As amigas de Sex and the City est\u0433o entre as criaturas da fic\u0437\u0433o mais repulsivas que j\u0431 conheci: f\u044ateis, est\u044apidas, ego\u043dstas e entediantes. Al\u0439m disso, isto n\u0433o \u0439 um filme, \u0439 um cat\u0431logo.Ono sto je u tridesetominutnoj epizodi moglo pro\u0107i kao vrckavi drustveni komentar u dva i pol sata se pretvorilo u praznu ljusturu.The ladies settle into the doldrums of marriage and their antics are reduced to a detached series of scenes that involve sulking, yearning or just plain indulging.Ultimately, it's this streak of realism that prevents Sex And The City from becoming just another fluffy New York fairytale.Sarah Jessica Parker's complex dance with love, marriage and Mr. Big provides the biggest notes in a symphony of wailing womanhood.... a gay camp parody of the way fabulous heterosexual women court affectionWhile he's let the movie run to excessive length, the well-practiced Parker King (throwing in more brand names than you will find in a Myers catalogue) knows what his target audience wanted from this reunion.The film is raw, sentimental and outrageously materialistic - just as a true fan would hope and expect it would be.The pacing barely ever breaks out of a light plod. And the writing is very, very average.I had to wonder what happened to the qualities that made the show famous: the outrageous dialogue, the sense of female camaraderie, the embrace of casual sex as a guiltless pleasure.When it neglects the fizz in favour of the grit (or at least the kind of grit acceptable for Sex And The City), this femme phenomenon hits the spot.This movie has generated record excitement in just about every woman of my acquaintance.I love Sarah Jessica Parker...Carrie and Mr. Big are definitely the best things about this film. But, at 2.5 hours long, there's just not enough good stuff to put this one over the top. I hate the sound of Kim Cattrall speaking, so that didn't help.Here is an unashamed celebration of materialist values, an orgy of labels, brands and product placements as sinful, by implication, as the behaviour of the characters.The four lead actresses are better than ever...costume designer Patricia Field, the 'fifth Beatle' as it were, has outdone herself.It's nice to see the girls again, but this \"City\" seems oddly smaller than it did when it ran on HBO. In the end, a more accurate title would have been \"Strife in the City.\" These women, after all, aren't having much sex.... a deeply satisfying wrap-up to a series that always had, in its heart of hearts, a lot more depth than the Manolo Blahniks it dressed itself up in.As someone who failed to appreciate the 'Sex and the City' TV series, I'm surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie celebration of friendship.To its voracious universe of cult-following fans, it feels like a TV marathon that spans an entire season. To everyone else who bats an indifferent eye, all the glam and glitz has something even for you to learn, too.An estrogen-fueled salute to the virtues of excess, if that's your Gucci bag.Though graced with far more sitcom laughs than real wit, the glorified soap opera is entertaining enough to be worth your while....after two and a half hours with these ladies, I've decided that I like them.Why get the band back together if you're not going to add some new songs to the greatest hits?I walked into the theatre hoping for a nice evening and came out as a hard-line Marxist, my head a whirl of closets, delusions, and blunt-clawed cattiness. All the film lacks is a subtitle: The Lying, the Bitch, and the Wardrobe.All we're left with is a movie that reminds us how good its source material once was and serves as a warning to anyone considering bringing a series to the big screen.The movie, scripted and directed by series veteran Michael Patrick King, caters to viewers nostalgic for the Emmy-winning show while pushing forward into feature film territory.What was slyly titillating in half-hour segments becomes silly, superficial and overwhemingly materialistic when stretched to nearly 2 1/2 hours. Bigger doesn't always mean better.Loaded with obvious product placement, the film should be called 'Sex and the City: The Catalog' instead of 'Sex and the City: The Movie.'Ultimately, Sex And The City serves as a glitter-laced love letter to its fans, which is really all it needs to be.It may have been four years since the HBO television series Sex and the City halted production of original episodes, but the characters and material are still not ready for their big-screen close-up.The movie's initially brisk pacing slackens when the girls spend a holiday in Mexico that's long enough for them to cycle through an entire resort-wear collection.In this film, the clothes and the city are characters as vital as the four leads, and they don't disappoint.Just as fun, sexy, and label heavy as the series.Sex and the City, which feels like a behind-numbing six episodes strung clumsily together, could be much fun in the hands of a veteran director.In both its TV and movie incarnations, the empty materialism and sincere longing for love always manage to cancel each other out, leaving behind nothing but what this started out as -- a sitcom.Flabby, unfocused reunion in which the emotional content is drowned out by the incessant pursuit and plugging of designer shoes, gowns and handbags.Sex and the City can't live up to the HBO series, but simply having the foursome together again will be more than enough for hardcore fans.An absurd joke.They're all over 40 now, and writer/director Michael Patrick King deftly balances their hard-won wisdom with the wistful dreams they still share. At the same time, there's plenty of fun to be had.We'll continue to experience befuddlement verging on disgust whenever we're reminded of Sex and the City (so named, we suppose, because Seriously Rethinking Third-Wave Feminism reads like ass on a poster).If you're a fan of the series, SATC will feel like a warm bath and a favorite meal with old friends. If you're not a fan, why in the name of Manolo Blahnik have you read this far?SATC offers well-developed characters, smart dialogue, interesting plots and sub-plots, and a ton of heart.A vision of which doesn't require its characters being frozen in amber after a fairy tale ending and allows life to go on, happily and unconventionally.More disappointment than joyful reunion, a tedious and desperately drawn-out affair that tests your patience even as it brazenly courts (and often earns) your contempt.For presold audiences only.Movin' on up to the movie big time means Sex and the City can no longer be accepted as just a cable-TV party game. It has to compete with the big girls, Hollywood's classic representations of female beauty, desire and strength. And it doesn't.The only empathy I felt was for the poor men that had to put up with these ridiculous girls.I am not the person to review this movie. Perhaps you will enjoy a review from someone who disqualifies himself at the outset, doesn't much like most of the characters and is bored by their bubble-brained conversations.Frothy as a Margarita and just as salty, Sex and the City all but mambos its way onto the screen.It was like attending a party where all the guests have known each other for years, exert no effort to make a newcomer feel at home and chatter endlessly -- yes, for two-and-a-half draggy hours -- about their romantic problems.Even fans may find themselves wondering when this very long episode will end.time ticks by easily like a lazy TV marathon, a humbler achievement than demanded by a diva flick that's as self-congratulatory as Indy across the multiplexIn short, Sex and the City the movie is everything Sex and the City the show ever was, as rambling and superficial as it is cunning and loveable.Yes, you will enjoy Sex and the City -- probably more so if you call things 'fabulous' and have more pairs of shoes than you have fingers.Having the story of Cinderella play a significant role in the feature introduces the deadpan irony that this version is told through the eyes of the stepsisters like a big screen version of Wicked only without the happy ending.If it all feels a mite perfunctory, a mite trite and a little dated (the girls haven't heard of the New Frugality?), Sex and the City still manages to be a hymn to hotness, hipness and haute couture, one its fans can happily sing along with.Sex and The City: The Movie is riddled with clich\u00e9s but the film works on a level that is smart, funny and just downright crude. Kim Cattrall, as Samantha, is the perfect balance to the series and the film.143 minutes of unbearably shallow characters, numerous extraneous plot threads in lieu of a central storyline and more product placements than in the \"Cannonball Run\" saga entire.It's like playing Barbies for grown-ups.I guess I can be most useful to this weekend's potential drag-alongs: it's not excruciating. I was never more than mildly annoyed.The fact of the matter is that this review doesn't matter.ridiculous and regressive.For those who'd like some substance in a movie pushing 2 1/2 hours, though, it's gratifying to report that this Sex is more than just a fan dance.Fans weaned on the stale, TBS version of the show will probably love it. Anyone expecting something remotely fresh is advised to look elsewhere.The show was at its best when it offered, without a great deal of extraneous examination, these glimpses into the nature of friendships between women. The movie needs more of that.It did about as much as I could hope for. It gives all four of its main characters plenty to do, it pays tribute to what's best about the series and it gives us another chance to spend time with people we thought we might never see again.Learning and hugging. There's lots of that here \u00e2\" woman to woman and man to woman \u00e2\" which satisfies the movie's fantasy fulfillment of both amity and eros.... feels like watching an entire season of shoe love, true love and everything in between -- all crammed into one loooooooooong sitting.It\u00e2(TM)s the fashion Olympics. Think of it that way, and what\u00e2(TM)s not to like?It's just that there's been an altitude adjustment -- fewer stilettos, more flats. Ask what women want of a chick flick and one answer may be this -- a pleasant reunion with cherished friends. Ask what women deserve and the answer is better.A girl can never have too many outfits, but a film can have too many scenes.Opt for the much better (and much shorter) version made in 1959 starring Hope Lange, Diane Baker, Suzy Parker and Joan Crawford.After staggering around a bit at the beginning it settles down and finds its groove. It's appropriately flashy, nicely naughty and wholly improbable, just as it's supposed to be.Fans rejoice: It's good. And smart. And funny.Judged by the standards of its original medium, the movie version succeeds just as well, cramming what used to take a whole season into a nearly 2 1/2 -hour marathon of men, misery and Manolos.Sex and the City: The Movie is no great shakes as a movie, but it doesn't have to be. What it does have to be is a happy revisit to a land its fans know well, and on that level it works very well.The movie is just like a half-season of the series -- a funny, sappy, clumsy, crude, rambunctious, argumentative, gleefully vulgar attempt to balance the fantasy of romance with the reality that the fantasy is impossible.A big, sloppy, gooey sundae of a film that is, for better or for worse, just like the show ... only longer.In its cinematic incarnation, Sex and the City has lost none of its bawdiness yet gained a more profound sense of soberness.From the running time to the plot development for each character, which grows to beating-a-dead-horse lengths in at least a couple of cases, the whole thing would have been better served by holding back a little.King fails to grasp what he once understood: When times are hard, you don't cry poverty. You step on the gas and give the audience a show.One of the movie's endearing qualities is its aversion to happily ever afters. In a way, it plays like the epilogue to your standard Hollywood romantic comedy.Cinerina invites her first guest reviewer, Melanie Treco. See full review for details.What does that say when a self-admitted narcissist receives such a following? In playing the victim card so often, Sarah Jessica Parker's character is one of the most unlikable characters I've seen in a long time.Was this bonbon to the show's fans, four years after the \"happily ever after\" series finale, really necessary?Plays like nothing more than a marathon viewing of an entire seventh season that should have never been made.To its credit, though, the movie turns Carrie's value system, which equates \"the two Ls--Labels and Love,\" to its advantage, and in the second half the movie achieves a nice balance between comedy and drama.It's too bad that the false sense of high heel empowerment never registers as soundly as our resident money-styling maidens look to achieve in this beleaguered City.Sex and the City is not a painful experience for men (or even guys), just a predictable one...Somewhere along the line, the movie version of Sex and the City got too much Botox injected into the script, and all the life was ironed out of it.It's nice to see these women again, because they are all rich and complex characters, but it's basically a sentimental exercise, designed for maximum cash flow before the idea is retired.I spent most of the film's 148 minutes just wanting to slap these women because I grew weary of their whining.Sex and the City: The Movie,/i> is the cherry on top of the series, and a fitting way to say a final good-bye to Carrie, Miranda, Samantha, Charlotte, and all their men.Hudson comes through so that you may remember her even when the popcorn is gone. If only the film itself did as well.Fans of Sex and the City will love the movie version.Carrie and Company Deliver the Same Old Song and DanceKing's attempt at \"racial balance\" pathetically backfires but at least proves useful in putting the show's inherently materialistic and supremacist ethos into sharper focus.If you don't love to watch fashion shows and Vogue photoshoots and designer wedding planning, \"Sex and the City\" and its consumer-driven fantasy world may elicit little more than yawns.Enjoyable big-screen sequel to the much-loved TV show that won't disappoint fans, thanks to strong performances and a script that is both moving and laugh-out-loud funny.Essentially there are four complete rom-coms here, which will delight series fans. And probably no one else.This movie provides no good reasons to revisit Sex and the City, except to fulfill fans' desires for one more for the road and add millions to Time Warner's coffers. Be careful what you wish for.For those who do not consider themselves to be among the Sex and the City faithful, this is a painful experience, perhaps the longest 148 minutes likely to be spent in a movie theater this year. Watching grass grow is more dramatically satisfying.King whips up enough quips and emotional moments to treat the faithful to a sort of moviegoing spa.A lot different from, say, watching several SATC episodes on DVD in succession as if gobbling fudge brownies. That may be OK for the living room, but in a multiplex, you just want things to move along already.The fans will (designer) label \"Sex and the City\" a hit this weekend.Witty, effervescent and unexpectedly thoughtful, the big-screen iteration of the HBO series stands up beautifully (and somewhat miraculously) to the twin pressures of popular expectation and critical assessment.A movie that taps directly back into the show's primal appeal, which is the sweet, sad, saucy delight of sharing these women's company.Beyond the shoes, the cosmopolitans and the disloyal men, Sex and the City has always been about the bond among women. At its best, the movie shows why that bond sticks.If you loved Sex as a TV show, you'll want to check out the film because it's like attending a class reunion. It's a chance to catch up with people who meant a lot to us.Devotees of the HBO series will probably flock to the movie...but anybody who's not already a fan is going to have difficulty understanding what all the fuss is about.Amid the style, sass and sexiness is plenty of sentimentality, especially at the satisfying conclusion.Bottom line the movie fails Movie Plot 101 by trying too hard. Too hard to appease its fans, too hard to color within the lines and too hard to prove that love conquers all.It's a pity that King didn't take more of a chance with his fanatically devoted audience and give them something they may not have quite expected or even really wanted.New York is fabulous, the clothes are fabulous and the shoes are beyond fabulous --- what more can a 'Sex and the City' devotee ask for? A sequel?There are flashes of graphic nudity and the usual salty language. But we fans wouldn't have it any other way.Sex and the City, the movie, feels like a glorified television episode in the best possible sense - utterly unchanged in spirit from its small screen roots yet just ambitious enough to validate its big screen adaptation....it's like being trapped in a dentist's office with nothing to read but an old issue of Vogue.There is something depressingly stunted about this movie; something desperate too.I hate, loathe and despise -- sorry to mince my words -- the movie based on the TV show.It's not a fashion romp. It has a strong emotional texture. The SATC women are still making bad choices.It's all really soapy, though, with only some smidgens of substance.I know this was made for the fans, but geez, was there no attempt to make it a good film?Sex and the City: The Motion Picture (not the actual title) is a joyful wallow. And it's more: In this summer of do-overs (The Incredible Hulk, a new Batman versus a new Joker), it's what the series finale should have been.It has more than enough sass, style and sentiment to keep the faithful satisfied. Add a star if you're a fan.You wouldn't spend valuable real-life time hanging out with self-absorbed idiots like this, so why on Earth would you watch a TV show (or a movie) about them?...so unexpectedly excellent.Some will be disappointed that it wasn't more adventurous. Some will love it because it is familiar. Some will wonder why all their friends are watching this crap.Sarah Jessica Parker is the pivot for this fabulous, fun frolic in which laughter and tears are shared through thick and thin, but always with glamour and style.Won't be redefining cinema as we know it, nor does it ever fully justify its existence as a feature film, but if you're a fan of the show, you probably won't care.... as comfortable and as decadent as sitting on the sofa with a big bowl of chocolate chip cookie dough.There were a lot of very funny moments in this film. I almost cried.If Sex and the City is a hit, it will be partly because it's an enjoyable and somewhat true depiction of female friendship. But grown women will also go to see it because, finally, someone made a movie for them.The end product is a case of bigger not necessarily being better.It is overly heavy -- at least an hour-and-a-half of its two-and-a-half-hour running time is spent with its heroine in abject heartbreak and depression, and that's when her friends aren't experiencing same.Writer/director Michael Patrick King's first attempt to slip into full-length features from television wears heavily, resulting in as poor a fit as Carrie sporting coveralls and clogs.Since it clocks in at almost 2 1/2 hours, you may think, sight unseen, that the movie version of the HBO smash Sex and the City is guilty of wretched excess. Pathetic excess is more like it.As gender-segregated experiences go, SATC is preferable to, say, that idiotic beefcake epic 300. The amusing thing about SATC is that it objectifies men in much the same way that most male-oriented movies objectify women.Isn't it encouraging to see that a big summer flick can be tethered to something other than a sweaty male action hero?The film is by no means a masterpiece, but it's a worthy exercise in indulgence that won't disappoint the cosmo-swilling core audience. And fans won't need to swill any cosmos to enjoy it.Bottom line: a provocative, groundbreaking TV series that worked in 30-minute segments has been bloated and padded into nearly two and a half hours of tedium and gratuitous product placement for everything from Vuitton to a new Mercedes-Benz GLK.fans will be thrilled to catch up with the gals. Non-fans will probably be a bit confused and wonder what all the fuss was about.One thing's for sure: fans of the series will lap this film up.Yes, it's good to see the Fab Four together again--you just wish they were in a funnier and wittier film than this indulgent and essentially middlebrow saga that feels like six TV episodes glued together, with a running time of two and a half hours!For a series so steeped in romance, the eagerly awaited Sex and the City movie feels a trifle half-hearted.The movie contains story lines strong enough to entertain both men and womenThis celebration with Carrie & Co. \u2014 very much television writ large \u2014 seems precisely the Sex and the City reunion the show's fans had hoped for.That neurotic clotheshorse and her somewhat liberated lusty ladies in waiting, steal the small screen show in their big screen debut, despite wearing their SATC sentimental and bubble-headed surface appeal like a badge of honor.I will be up front about this. The movie was not made for me, so I found it pretty insignificant. But it's also quite painless.Shock hit me several times while watching the movie, and never in a good way.the pithy premise becomes just so much sub-par chick-litI'm just not that into it.Sex and the City never feels like a cash-in. Instead, it plays more like a labor of love for everyone involved.As the movie drifts into its third hour, you start to feel that it's not joy that's keeping you in the theater. It's duty.As for the fanboys, they really should do something more beneficial to humankind than attacking female-centric films every chance they get -- ever hear of that proverbial long walk off a short pier?",

        "document": "Somewhere around the 45-minute mark the film transforms from cool-and-atmospheric thriller to indecipherable mess.Madly over-plotted, with overlapping time frames and puzzling sub-plots, it makes no concessions to neophytes.Day Watch deploys head-spinning cinematography and cool special effects. It's a trippy affair, even if it's just about impossible to track.all at once a complex morality tale, a dark mirror of post-Soviet Russia, and a masterpiece of dynamic surrealism, displaying some of the most imaginative visual effects yet seen in a feature-length movie.It relates to Night Watch the way X2 relates to X-Men: you need to have seen the earlier film to have a hope of following the plot, but it's a bigger, deeper, more exhilarating ride.Visually inventive and bleakly witty, this is a must for fans of off-kilter fantasy thrillers.Wearying and hard to follow at times, sure, but fun.Where Night Watch felt visceral and immediate, Day Watch feels cerebral and dismissive. Retains the first film's gorgeous and arresting visual style and ejects all the good story stuff.[Director] Bekmambetov succeeds in crafting a movie so fast-paced and stylish that it doesn't matter why there's a battle sequence or car chase, you just sit back and enjoy the ride.The ultimate downfall of the series is that it steadfastly refuses to define its own rules.... a mindless muddle - loud, slowly paced, and overdone; in other words, it is exactly like a bad Hollywood blockbuster, except for the subtitles.Although more flashily assembled, pic's relentless onslaught charms less over a running time almost 25 minutes longer.Day watch is nonsense. But it's glorious nonsense.While it's not as good as the first film, Day Watch is a nice alternative to the American horror flicks that have been polluting the cinemas this year.Narrative incoherence continues to reign supreme.Visually, it mixes a gritty reality with eye-popping horror-fantasy, but the story short-circuits the film by adding a level of incomprehensibility, particularly in its second half.Let's hope the humor is intentional; it's frankly hard to tell.Watch's supernatural police and Bekmambetov's rich visual palette give the film enough strength at least to throw a couple elbows to set itself apart from other nameless films with plenty of effects, but little vision.There's a lot more to make your eyes goggle, too, as the Watches chase each other up, down and under the streets of Moskva.mporei to epiko toy pragmatos na einai telika perissotero sto kefali ton synteleston opos kai i idea oti kanoyn kati megalytero apo holigoyntiano mplokmpaster, alla pantoy diakrineis ayti tin periergi slabiki ithiki kai se arketes periptoseis tin ieri treA must-see for fans of the original, but a shorter running time and less energetic CGI excess might have done this flawed horror fantasy a serious favour.A disappointing follow-up to Timur Bekmambetov's ground-cracking debut that still holds just enough explosiveness to blow a few fuses in your brain. Watch for the set-pieces (killer balls, car chases, power lines used as whips) and ignore the rest.Big, stupid and nonsensicalA slog through endless death metal-powered action sequences.Day Watch combines the action sequences of a John Woo blockbuster with wonderfully self-conscious humour and hardcore human interest.Even during its action sequences it is slow, confusing and apparently interminable.As ornate as a high class Russian samovar, Day Watch continues the battle between Light and Dark in Timur Bekmambetov's unmistakable high octane fashion.Impressively directed with superb special effects, this is an action-packed fantasy flick that's actually more fun than the first film.The film undeniably has buckets of style, aided and abetted by some extremely funky animated subtitles.Part zombie, part vampire and all a pain in the neck.Day Watch, like Night Watch, doesn't take itself seriously, one of its chief charms.However innovative and arresting the filmmaking, interest in this chapter begins to wane at the 105-minute mark.Aside from one stunning image of a sports car skidding along the face of a curved high-rise hotel, Night Watch fails to even equal its forebear's handful of flashy CG moments.A marked improvement over the original, it further proves Bekmambetov's abilities as a visionary filmmaker, though he sometimes loses sight of storytelling in favor of impressive action sequences and amusing sidetracks.The worst thing Bekmambetov has picked up from his American models is the tendency of megasequels to aggrandize material grown enervated, to compensate for thinness by spreading out.The picture is still a Russian-centric blob of overcooked genre pie filling, aiming high but barely able to keep up with itself; yet, Day Watch is a step in the right directionDazzles and confuses with equal determination.An oddly sweet-tempered mix of hyperbole, understatement and profoundly Slavic philosophizing about guilt, freedom and responsibility.With what seems to be a freer hand and a bigger budget, Bekmambetov returns with an even slicker, faster-paced and funnier take on the black magical sub-castes born in the novels of Sergei Lukyanenko and Vladimir Vasiliev.The first film ... had style and a specifically Russian streak of dark angst. Day Watch continues in that tradition but adds one unexpected element -- a weird sense of humor.Chalk of Fate? I'll refrain from the nails-on-a-chalkboard references when it comes to Day Watch - not because I can resist whacky wordplay, but because the movie was so monotones to me, I couldn't muster an actual cringe.Bekmambetov mostly keeps his story moving forward on the back of his immensely likable protagonist, played by Konstantin Khabensky.If you don't take it seriously -- i.e., if you're able to laugh at the notion of a piece of chalk that undoes time -- the sequel is a minor wackjob head trip.Bekmambetov and his crafty cinematographer Sergei Trofimov have so many different tricks that you'll be smiling at the scenes that make no sense.The story could easily bog down in its mix of cumulative incident and complicated interpersonal drama. But with Bekmambetov at the helm, it's a high-energy blast.There are many stunning special effects, including a car chase up the side of a building, as well as the sort of wild animated subtitles that turned up in Night Watch.Night Watch was a deliriously stylish and endlessly inventive rollercoaster ride; Day Watch adds emotional resonance to the mix to create an epic that's got more energy and depth than all three Lord of the Rings movies combined.Day Watch sports a fast and exciting surface, but none of it makes a lick of sense.The cinematic equivalent of a bludgeon that wallops you into a sort of mindless stupor with its brazenly stupid plot and chintzy visual pyrotechnics.This sequel reprises the original's conceit that if you just throw a lot of cool fantasy ballyhoo together, who cares if coherence becomes collateral damage? [This] is what you'd imagine it's like being stuck inside the head of a geeky 12-year-old boy.Day Watch could have been shorter and simpler, but the same might be said for any of the current Hollywood blockbusters -- none of which offer as many surprises.You don't need to have seen the original to pick up the user-friendly sequel. Take a deep breath after the intimidating opening montage and you'll be just fine.\"Daywatch\" looks huge -- Bekmambetov really knows how to marshal his limited resources. But the picture feels heavy; sitting through it is like swimming through lard.At an hour and 10 minutes... I was itching with boredom... Unfortunately, with the film's excruciating running time of two hours and 20 minutes, my ordeal had reached only the halfway point.Day Watch may not suit everyone, but it opens a big can of Russian whoop-de-whoop on anyone willing to take it.This sequel to the convoluted Night Watch offers more of the same.Were I to tell you the summer's most awesome blockbuster action sequel involved a war over a piece of chalk, you'd laugh. But it's true.To the credit of [director] Timur Bekmambetov, it is possible to dive into the second chapter of the ambitious, visually dazzling Russian fantasy trilogy that began with 2004's Night Watch without feeling completely adrift.It's exhausting just trying to imagine what 46-year-old director Timur Bekmambetov would do with Hollywood money. Yet, as puffed up as it is, Day Watch is redeemed by its sardonic, Slavic take on the end of the world.Day Watch is fast and furious and larded with bizarre laughs, and given its ending, we really can't wait to see what happens in Dusk Watch, the third installment.It's a playful, surrealistic antidote to standard genre entertainment.Its imagination is limited. The backstory is shallow and pat. Its characters are mostly one-note. And everything goes on much too long at 133 minutes.\"Day Watch\" is like a drone of cinematic House music for the eyes.Maybe they didn't invent the vampire movie. But thanks to Night Watch and now Day Watch, the Russians certainly have the last word in it.The filmmakers destroy Moscow with the same glee that Godzilla has in stomping Tokyo. Even though Day Watch is probably a good 20 minutes too long, it's easy to forgive its excesses because Bekmambetov just seems to be having so much fun.The pretentious plot aside, this is a highly stylized film that effortlessly blends brilliant imagery with heart-pounding action sequences.Answers the eternal question: The world will not end in fire or ice but by a yo-yo.Stylistically very different from anything we normally see in the United States. It's a lush film, bathed in an opulent darkness and dread. It has a Russian sensibility and embraces the character driven philosophy of European films.The series' theme might be that the center cannot hold, but the idea gets played out too literally, as Day Watch can barely keep an idea on the screen for a few minutes before whipping off in a new direction.It has fewer hallmarks of an epic, but it feels bigger, fuller -- a more complete work of fantasy.There's something to be said when the big reveal of a hiding place for a piece of chalk is more emotionally satisfying than the dramatization of a young boy turning towards evil.In comparison [to Night Watch], Day Watch is straightforward, explaining what's gone before while telling a fantastical story and having fun doing it.Daywatch has the fingerprints of Hollywood miscalculation.One hell of a movie.Day Watch is a bit like Vegas: a bunch of crazy, gaudy stuff that all fits together surprisingly well.Blurs the distinction between the pretentious and the profound. Still, the illusion is a viscerally compelling one and begs the question of how Bekmambetov will ever top himself.Surprisingly, Day Watch ups the ante with preposterously entertaining plot lines and fewer mind blowing effects [than the first].Spectaculars don't come much more bombastic than this goth-Russian supernatural epic.Every bit as puzzling as its predecessor, but it's shot in such a bold, crazy way that you have to admire its pure audacity.At 2 hours and 20 minutes, this zippy follow-up to Night Watch delivers a killer pace, blasts of heavy-metal, vexed characters, and gory allegory wherein occult terrorists suck blood, cast spells and escape to a spooky zone known as the Gloom.It's more action-oriented and has a lot more welcome humor [than the first]....nearly gave me a seizure (and movie-wise, I don't seizure lightly).Day Watch falls prey to the curse of most sequels in which 'more' is often a thin concept stretched beyond its limits and misconstrued to mean 'bigger and better.'It delivers more cutting-edge eye candy but defies any attempt at understanding.A noisy, incoherent, droning spectacle.[Director] Bekmambetov is a reckless and juvenile storyteller with a regrettable knack for empty spectacle.stylish but outrageously foolishJust another high concept/low content entry into the blockbuster market.Chockablock with neat ideas - so many, in fact, that they ultimately end up crowding each other out ... goofy, monumental fun, until it sort of isn't.Mixing history, sword & sorcery and science-fiction, Day Watch is overstuffed with gimmicks, making it a noisy but nifty-looking mess. Although wall-to-wall action, only a few sequences -- such as the climactic hotel showdown between the forces of Light aA perfect example of a filmmaking rule that seems to be true no matter what the country of origin - sequels are always bigger, louder, and crazier than the first one.A mish-mash of the worst traits of Boll, Luc Besson and all the fears promised of the Cold War.Even though I never quite understood the film, I at least had the sense that there's something to it, and it's worth my effort to eventually figure it out.",

        "document": "[Kidman's Mrs. Coulter is] a movie villain worth remembering -- in fact, if she were any more evil, she would have to change her name from Marisa to Ann.Like every other story that pits the Haves against the Have-Nots.In adapting Pullman's novel, Weitz jettisons its distinctive atmosphere and complex (and controversial) theological background and decides instead to whip through the plot....the cast is deadly serious, bringing each character to life and giving the audience a reason to cheer or boo them and their actions.The Golden Compass bears the brush strokes of a film produced by a committee of people intent on trying to make some money rather than a good movie.All the pieces combined feel like nothing more than a barrage of exquisitely crafted namesMy devotion to Jesus and love for my fellow man have been replaced with profound emptiness and contempt, and I have The Golden Compass to thank for it.Said Ridley Scott: 'We were contemplating talking animals in Blade Runner, but we wanted to hold off Sean Young's descent into madness at least until the end of principal shooting.'Come back, \"Eragon\"--all is forgiven!Patchy and strangely unengaging, The Golden Compass is impressive in scale but disappoints by its cluttered storytelling and lack of heart.The Golden Compass is an entertaining blend of feisty pre-teen girl heroine, CGI animals both adorable and fierce, and the usual suspects on the human side ...koyrastika amihani kai sygkehymeni kritiki sto thriskeytiko systima, den parehei oyte kata dianoia arketo allothi gia toys ano ton 16 na asholithoyn idiaitera me aytin tin yperparagogi, poy ehei aytapates megaleioy tin ora poy pashei sto rythmo kai ti synThis Compass points to the end of a would-be franchise.Lyra surpasses the timid drone of Pan's Labyrinth or the Pevensies' do-gooder sap, she's brave, smart, and the best liar in the universe.Deus ex machina ... is the only driving force.Suggesting at once Mrs. Coulter's devotion to her Magisterial mission, her fears of soulful and sensual embodiment, and yes, her own split self, her slap-and-hug of her damon all but stops the film's action.No, I didn't read the novel before seeing the film, and nothing in this shimmering disaster made me want to read it, either. Made me hate polar bears, and I used to love the darned things, so that's saying something.The Golden Compass should be fun, but it rarely is. It should sweep you away, but it rarely does. For a film suffused with magic, it is, regrettably, far from magical.A beautiful, thought-provoking fantasy film.Read this review, skip this movie, and instead read the excellent books. Poor Dakota Blue Fanning is the perfect Lyra in a terrible adaptation....the film possesses few attributes designed to draw in (and hold the interest of) neophytes.Those seeking a treatise on religion, or against religion, will have to look hard to find it in \"The Golden Compass,\" a convoluted but eye-catching fantasy.Unlike most fantasy aimed at younger audiences, there's a disturbing undercurrent at work here that imbues the film with a weightiness that's unusual in such works.Exciting and entertaining, although the complicated array of characters makes it sometimes hard-going.If you haven't read the books, it can be like wandering into a stuffy church service in a cathedral for the first time.For a film that supposedly promotes Atheism, at least it's more entertaining than last year's Christian allegory The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe.'The Golden Compass' concludes in a way that left me feeling teased and cheated.The Catholic League thinks it's anti-Catholic. Admirers of Philip Pullman's 1995 His Dark Materials trilogy think the film guts the backbone of the book. Me, I just think it blows.Wanting to appeal to a broad audience %u2014 especially young teens %u2014 is more than fine. It's admirable. But soulful, philosophical 13-year-olds do exist. They do! And they can even handle a religious discussion with lots of words involved.I heard the dialogue, I saw the images, but I never got into the story. I was always aware that I was sitting in a theater watching a movie.The Golden Compass isn't bad, it's cast is too good and it's too well made, but something fundamental to good storytelling - heart - has been lost, leaving a final product as icy and impossible to care for as Mrs. Coulter herself.Begets the less than ringing endorsement, 'Yeah, whatever. It was OK I suppose.'An engaging fantasy adventure that, albeit no masterpiece, is hardly the disaster one might have imagined.Excruciating papThis plot may sound somewhat ludicrous on paper, but Pullman has created a logical, well-thought-out world that Weitz has brilliantly translated to the big screen.I realize that when you make a book into a movie you cannot include every single detail, but it seems like Weitz purposely tried to take all of the magic out of the story....if I hadn't liked Pullman's books so much, I probably would have liked this movie version more than I did.This kid film noir touching on magic dust substance abuse, cranky clerics, worrisome wizards, goth grownup child abusers and computer-generated homicidal polar bear throat slashers, is less likely to dazzle the senses than exhaust minds of all ages.Sam Elliott shows up as a cowboy, who would normally be a pick-me-up, but with Golden Compass I just wanted to find my direction home.Will it be enough to satisfy fans of Philip Pullman's widely read 'His Dark Materials' trilogy? Hard to say. But for the uninitiated this is an engaging adventure, even when Chris Weitz's screenplay lacks the compelling clarity of Pullman's prose.",

        "document": "A very funny movie that is able to combine a great premise with ideal actors, laugh out scenes with a sentimental touch and over the top sequences with a believable story line.A crisply paced romp featuring pitch-perfect performances by adversarial leads Robert De Niro and Ben Stiller.A comedy that has likeable, human characters as well as consistent laughs.Watching Ben get the girl or be seriously injured trying always has its dry, keening pleasures.I can't remember when I last laughed so hard during a film. DeNiro and Stiller are a perfect match and I walked out of the theater wanting to see more of these characters.Quite simply, this Focker has us laughing out loud frequently and abundantly.Robert De Niro and Ben Stiller give the comedy of disaster a nice little workout.The real comic bite comes from the combustible energy between the two lead actors.It's warm and humorous and avoids being mean-spirited, which alone makes it special.This fall's pleasant surprise.High concept that aims for the middle and meets its mark emphatically and satisfyingly.The film is uproarious without ever becoming nasty or mean-spirited.Passable movie entertainment, but like most future in-laws leaves a feeling of something still desired.With near-Swiss precision, director/producer Jay Roach ... and his writers make sure familiarity breeds hilarity.This is one hell of a funny movie, folks.De Niro delivers.Wonderfully funny.Whenever the movie is about to go wrong, something happens to set it right -- usually instigated by the coldly mean De Niro or the hot, nervous Stiller.I had a good time at Meet the Parents, even though the ratio of clinkers to yucks is disproportionately high.I literally found myself gasping for breath during Meet the Parents' most comic moments, wishing I could rewind the film.De Niro, once again proving that he understands comedy as well as urban psychoses.Roach ... knows to play to the movie's twin strengths: Stiller and De Niro.The gross-out factor is surprisingly low, and the combination of Stiller and De Niro is inspired: No father could be more formidable, no prospective son-in-law better equipped to squirm.Once again, Roach smokes. Meet the Parents is an extremely pleasant surprise, a high-concept romantic comedy that actually works.I didn't laugh so often as many of the people sitting around me at Meet the Parents, but I laughed enough to think: Yep, not bad.Great fun.With Meet the Parents, mainstream Hollywood reclaims one of its former strengths. It proves that it still knows how to provide audiences with a good time.Jay Roach, best known for the broad farce of the Austin Powers films, shows an unexpected flair for directing character comedy.Unlike most family squabbles, you'll find this one an amusing diversion.Possibly the most amusing mainstream live-action comedy since There's Something About Mary.Stiller portrays a human accident better than anyone and he definitely knows how to extort laughs and sympathy from his audienceDirector Jay Roach of the Austin Powers films keeps the pace brisk, and the script by Jim Herzfeld and John Hamburg ably piles the pratfalls ludicrously high.What gives the film its special kick is the match of Stiller and De Niro....large swaths of the proceedings feel as though they'd be more at home within a garden-variety sitcom.Star-driven comedy at times offensive and funny.Scenes that should have been uproarious are weaker than many of the movie's smaller moments, whose everyday humor isn't specific to the plot or characters.Owes about 55 percent of its charm to De Niro, who can be hilarious just sitting there.Packed with cringe-worthy moments from beginning to end, Jay Roach's comedy is for anyone who has ever endured a weekend in the company of potential in-laws.Alas, poor Focker. He can't help himself. And we can't help ourselves from falling about, equally helpless, at this superbly antic movie.Nobody plays put-upon quite like Ben Stiller.Guaranteed to put you off suggested Sunday outings for life.Stiller plays a familiar character with a nice energy and presence, making the most of all his character's asides and observations.As far as one-joke movies go, this one has its guffaws.Does the usual Hollywood bit of setting up the gags way in advance so that even a coma patient can spot them.The best American comedy of 2000. It has wit, slapstick and romance -- as well as an improbable comedy team in Robert De Niro and Ben StillerAn entertaining little outing, but not something that will stay with me.A definite must-see that's perfect for a guys' night out or a relaxing date.Never before have two such skilled actors been so monstrously squandered in a movie so replete with failed gags and pathetic gaffes.Astutely observed, subtly played and consistently hilarious...Contains enough belly-laughs and sly jokes to become one of the bigger crowd-pleasers of the fall.What saves the movie from remaining an exercise in self-parody for all involved is director Roach's feel for the material.This is, unquestionably, the best comedy currently on release. Highly recommended.This film is almost too real to be funny. It is one uncomfortable moment after another - and that is what Stiller does best, but director Roach would have done well to tone it down a bit.Stiller has a gift for looking funny effortlessly, when he's doing nothing physical. With no mugging, no physical contortions, he turns his face into a palette of pain and confusion.This simple but well-constructed comedy picks a situation that naturally causes anxiety - meeting your in-laws - and turns it into a walk through hell.I'm eagerly awaiting a sequel.Great filmmaking this is not, but if you're looking for an amusing, undemanding couple of hours, give this a try.Overbearingly cruel and only modestly funny.Too many actors make the error of thinking that being funny involves lots of hysteria and hyperactivity, but De Niro knows that good comic acting is no different than good dramatics: The performance must be grounded in truth.Consistently more fun than it has any right to be, Meet the Parents is an example of how sometimes it really is all about casting the right couple of stars.A five star hoot.The sight-gags and verbal repartee hinge upon uninspired, lowest-common-denominator hijinks.Meet the Parents generates most of its laughs in the give-and-take between Stiller and De Niro....highly amusing...at times leaves most of the men in the audience throwing their heads back and realizing exactly how realistic the situation at hand is.Es lamentable que el talento de DeNiro se est\u00e9 desperdiciando en cintas que no terminan de cuajar, por muy taquilleras que \u00e9stas seanA brilliant comedy in which we laugh that we do not cry -- although we do wince, as every expectation the main character has of things turning out okay crumbles and his face gets ever the redder.Deliciously funny and warmly poignant, it's a treat to Meet the Parents.Ben Stiller, an excellent comic actor, does some of his best work here, matched up with one of the all-time greats, Robert De Niro.None of the jokes are forced, which makes Meet the Parents a singular achievement.[Roach] does know how to stage discrete comic moments, taking mildly humorous nightmares and turning them into nicely wrought miniatures.Meet the Parents is a one- -- well, maybe two- -- joke idea that starts out goofy and fun, but soon runs out of verbal or visual ammunition.Never before have two such skilled actors been so monstrously squandered in a movie so replete with failed gags and pathetic gaffs.It's the prom night scene from There's Something About Mary stretched out over an entire movie - just not as funny.If ever there was a movie that felt like it was built backward, it's Meet the Parents.While it's a truism that all comedy has an element of sadism, it doesn't necessarily follow that all sadism is funny.More often than not, the movie's tension gets in the way of its giggles, falling back on its stars' comedy instincts and over-extended running gags.It never quite gets going.Plays like a thirty minute sitcom that overstays its welcome for more than an hour.There is an uneven mix of slapstick sequences and human comedy. Certainly the last part of the film feels awkwardly written.Ben Stiller is simply fantastic, and this DeNiro kid could be big someday.It was a well-acted, likable and benignly amusing film.A hilarious hodgepodge of The In-Laws and Annie Hall, in which De Niro gives his best comic performance to date.A non-stop riot headed up by the first rate pairing of Ben Stiller and Robert DeNiro.When the script puts its faith in the audience, allowing us to find the laughs on our own, the film is irresistible, a bright lark. Yet when the writers panic, upping the antic volume and shifting into crazed sitcom gear, the lark stops.This truth doesn't hurt as much as the infamous franks-and-beans scene from There's Something About Mary, but the pain and the laughter last longer.One of those cruel-yet-very-funny crowd pleasers.Solid, sadistic Stiller fare.Stiller, who is shaping up to be one of the most adept comic performers of our time, does a terrific job of building sympathy for the hapless outsider.A straightforward romantic comedy that doesn't take a lot of chances, but still manages to deliver the goods.Meet the Parents gets its best moments in the friction between De Niro and Stiller. Their screen personas -- the intimidator and the hapless smart guy -- are a perfect mismatch, and the spark between them ignite plenty of laughs.The jokes work, because they are so relentless and absurd.With current comedy obsessed with oh-so-clever ironic gestures and tricksy pastiche, Meet the Parents' dedication to consistent, straightforward belly laughs is totally refreshing.Meet the Parents builds brilliantly on interlocking comic situations.There is a sub-category of comedy ... in which we laugh at the hideously humiliating experiences of some poor sap. If this is your kind of humor, than this is your kind of movie.Meet the Parents doesn't sparkle like Vincente Minnelli's Father of the Bride. But with bubbly adult comedies at such a premium, it goes down like a flute of Champagne, leaving an aftertaste of giggles.Most of the humor here is pretty clever.Stiller is brilliant.A string of non-stop humor.Funny bits abound, overstuffed to the point of tearing at the seams, the film might have benefited from a bit more cutting.Even with Stiller and De Niro, Meet the Parents is an encounter that can be postponed until it's available on video.An unfathomably awful film that will undoubtedly be a smash hit.While it doesn't quite live up to its potential, it's still a heck of a lot funnier than what usually passes for comedy in these days.That the film works in spite of the people behind the camera says a lot for the people in front of the camera.It's laugh-out-loud funny.Follows a rather predictable, well-worn path, but the sheer joy of performing on the actors' parts sells the film as a whole.A hilarious comedy about the ridiculous lenghts a young man goes to in order to prove himself to his girlfriend's family.Stiller and De Niro play off well against each other, and neither goes too far off the deep end.With all due respect to giggles, though, you would do better to rent Raging Bull.Meet the Parents is much too herky-jerky to be completely successful, and it follows each laugh-out-loud scene with one that is completely -- or is at least a bit -- cringe-worthy.Very fun and very entertaining.An entertaining comic nightmare, but like most bad dreams, it disappears once the lights come up.Though Meet the Parents features a capable supporting cast, the laughs come almost exclusively from the tussle between Stiller and De Niro, and both deliver.I haven't laughed this hard since the trailer for Billy Elliot.If De Niro's mafia comedy Analyze This went for cheap laughs, Meet The Parents develops real depth.Meet the Parents might not be sophisticated comedy, but it's certainly enjoyable.Flat-out hilarious.DeNiro is the real pleasure to watch.In many ways reminiscent of There's Something About Mary.An adult-oriented comedy that, while hardly reserved, rests its very funny foundation on well-conceived characterization, lively dialogue and good acting.A comedy that works for the most part while in other sections has the audience waiting for a TV laugh track that doesn't come.Don't go to this movie if you've recently had hernia surgery, because the expression 'bust a gut laughing' might go beyond metaphor in your case.Uneven in tone, often trite and certainly neither De Niro nor Stiller's finest, Meet the Parents is nevertheless a funny and sometimes substantial movie.You feel you've seen it all before: There's Something About Mary did it funnier, and The Heartbreak Kid did it wiser. But when Stiller is let loose, you never feel that Charles Grodin did it drier.A clever situation-comedy that delivers quite a few laughs.Within its formulaic confines, the humor works uncommonly well from time to time.Meet the Parents is hysterical.A good-spirited comedy.Has all the elements for a memorable farce and succeeds more often than not.See it with someone you love -- and maybe with his or her parents.This isn't Ernst Lubitsch or anything, but the movie is consistently funny without the calculated gross-out moments that have been dominating mainstream comedy in recent years.If you can just accept the fact that real human behavior has been thrown out the window like the baby in Andy Warhol's Bad, then you'll have a really good time watching Stiller and De Niro square off.Meet the Parents has all the elements of either a bedroom farce or a Hardy Boys mystery. Turns out it's the former, and a mighty funny one at that.You couldn't do much better than to pit De Niro at his most humorlessly imposing against Ben Stiller at his most anxiously eager to please.A refreshing change from the current trend of gross and grosser humor.It never runs out of steam or ways of inflicting more ignominy on Stiller.It's funny. Really funny.Even better than There's Something About Mary.A very funny movie.There's hardly anything surprising about Meet the Parents, except that it's much funnier than you might expect.",

        "document": "It's the opposite of most films about drugs vs. life because it puts life up front.Granik gets a strong performance out of Farmiga, as she does from nearly the whole cast.Quietly devastating.a brave, elegantly filmed, treasure of perseveranceThis film has an ear for the way moms talk to kids, a sensitivity to drug-sweetened intimacies, and an appreciation of the urgent nuance, not just the comedy, of recovery-speak.A terrifically dark tale.Unlike most movies about addictions, Down to the Bone doesn't follow the usual, comforting three-act structure -- social user develops a problem, user becomes a desperate addict, user finally gets some help.Any sympathy developed for the characters quickly erodes as they continue to not only engage in self-destructive behavior but expose children to it.You'll see relative unknown Farmiga deliver one of those subtle, controlled, humane performances that should win Oscars but never do because the Oscars are a lot of jive.First-time feature director's disciplined objectivity is coupled with humanism in this collaboration with a gifted cast and cinematographer.... a harrowing character study.Down to the Bone emerges with an aura of authenticity so strong as to be mesmerizing, thanks to a superior script brought to life with infallibly natural performances ...Whether you're ready for the ride depends on whether you're looking for traditional filmic fare, or whether you're in the mood to be dragged into the depths of depression.A glimpse into the private lives and dirty secrets of people trying to claw their way to a better place.Debra Granik's independent drama \"Down to the Bone\" builds with a strong, quiet intensity.This marks [Farmiga's] arrival as One to Watch. See her here, and you can say you remember the early days.Vera Farmiga gives an astonishing performance in this complex chronicle of a drug addict who goes through rehab, yearning for redemption, but her experience is not tidy and there's no neat conclusion.Conventional movies, even independent ones, tend to get histrionic and judgmental about such drug-related setbacks. But Granik's film, though hardly a clinical case study, keeps a measured distance from the heavy-handed or simplistic.Down to the Bone achieves what only the best independent films have: making life, at its most unvarnished, a journey.[A] small, beautifully faceted gem.For actress Vera Farmiga, Down to the Bone presents her with a breakout role.Granik brings to her drama a clear-eyed realism as she charts one woman's descent into a drug-fueled purgatory.... a stark, realistic portrait of a working-class mother in New York's depressed Ulster County as she tries to battle a drug habit.A quietly harrowing chronicle of addiction and fragile recovery anchored by Vera Farmiga's intense performance.if you've ever wondered why people in 12-step programs aren't supposed to sleep together right off the bat, well, this movie is about to show you, in detail.Strong performances from Vera Farmiga and Hugh Dillon keep things from becoming overdramatic.Farmiga effectively shows the fear, need and hope at war within Irene, how the false high of being clean for a week can fade when she realizes the second week isn't going to be any easier.The film is so pitch perfect and realistic, it seems you are there with these people, watching their lives unfold before you as it happens.If there were an ounce of taste left in Hollywood, the magnificent Vera Farmiga would be a front-runner for the Best Actress Oscar.The movie takes us down an unexpected path with riveting skill and a refreshing lack of easy answers.The movie boasts a fantastic performance by Vera Farmiga and an exceedingly unhappy storyline. It's a movie you \"appreciate\" more than you \"enjoy.\"This downbeat story of blue-collar drug abuse becomes a moving portrait of people battling their inner demons, thanks to an outstanding acting ensemble.The movie seems to be about drug addiction and recovery, but it gradually shifts, becoming a look from an unusual angle at what a big job it is to be a parent and the priorities it requires.",

        "document": "[Guiraudie] has given Stranger by the Lake a grandeur that goes beyond the anecdotal. You see it both in the expansiveness of the setting and in the faithfulness of a born filmmaker to the materials of cinema.The existential loneliness...and the evanescent nature of deeper human interaction in a world where sexual compulsion takes top priority are evoked with a powerfully dry yet keen observation that is heartbreaking.\"Stranger by the Lake\" is seductive and fascinating, but it is also a bit trapped in its own conceit, and in its carefully maintained emotional detachment.\"Stranger by the Lake\" is the sexiest and most elegant thriller in years, and it's a damn shame it stands so little chance of traveling beyond the niche of a \"gay film\" it will probably get squeezed into.Like his characters, [director Alain] Guiraudie is walking a tightrope, finding the point where sex and death exude a similar allure. You won't be able to look away.A psychosexually intriguing blend of Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window and William Friedkin's Cruising ...Though it'll be confined to the art house circuit, Stranger By the Lake actually has all the ingredients of a mainstream, page-turning summer beach read.Everything, from the sex to the relationships to the genre elements, is in a bothersome but no less captivating state of flux.A cautionary tale about finding love with an improper stranger.So much of this beguiling film's beauty is in how it sneaks up on you, the way genre elements quietly insinuate their way into the story.Guiraudie's film is acutely brilliant on the funny, scary machinery of desire, and how easily humans can get caught up in its cogwheels.Alain Guiraudie - remember that name.It shimmers with that intoxicating sun-on-the-water allure that might make someone not quite themselves.Alain Guiraudie's thriller is characterised both by its formal ingenuity and its surprisingly graphic gay sex. The plotting rekindles memories both of Patricia Highsmith novels and of Hitchcock films.As an exercise in style, this minimalist noir erotic thriller is pretty cool. But it loses its way somewhere around the midpoint and never quite finds it again.Like a wry scientist, wading through the jungle, Guiraudie notes every tiny, unwritten law. It's infectious stuff.Even though this dramatic thriller is set in a place most viewers will be unable to identify with, filmmaker Alain Guiraudie and his cast draw us in completely.When was the last time you saw an erotic thriller that worked simultaneously on both levels?A simple and ruthlessly effective exercise in minimal narrative and style, Alain Guiraudie's moral tale is so restrained and atmospheric that the nudity and graphic sex don't upstage the creepy mood of seductive, inescapable doom.I thought the film silly if endearing. Fluff noir. Others, peering into the crystal, see and prophesy a cult future for filmmaker Alain Guiraudie.Guiraudie's telling is fairly cold-blooded, but the choreographed dance of desire and disappointment still manages to intrigue.Hitchcock by way of Cruising.Beautifully crafted, sinister, frightening, erotic and thought-provoking, Alain Guiraudie's multi-faceted Cannes triumph is already one of the most provocative, intriguing films of the year.Desire, danger and death - Guiraudie uses the water's edge as a playground for hedonistic predators and willing prey.The motivations may be questionable, but desire has a way of clouding even the clearest heads.A gripping and superbly directed picture with something to say about the nature of infatuation and obsession.Oddly for such a suspenseful film, Stranger by the Lake is rather encouraging in its insistence on the different shapes that human connection can take.A sophisticated, unpredictable and original modern noir.Notable already for its depiction of real sex, it's explicit in other ways too: a depiction of amoral attraction that deserves a wider audience than mere fans of elegant congress.Sun, sex, psychosis, skinny-dipping: it sounds like genre tat, but Guiraudie's dark, droll study of a risky attraction upends expectations. It plays by stealth, but its sly grip is sure.Hitchcockian in the most lurid sense of the word.Hot and cold and provocative in more than just the expected ways, Stranger by the Lake presents even the most dishonest sex as an honest thrill.There are very real, very potent emotions underlying every action, be it an explicit sex act, a lingering embrace, or a horrible realization that meting out death does not necessarily preclude love.Confronting. Explicit. Eerie. Nightmarish. Its atmosphere lingers long in my memory, rolling over the haunting images and spectral sounds.Stranger By The Lake is a small, highly polished film detailing how easily morality can become unmoored, Lord of the Flies-style, in an enclosed society that refers only to itself.An erotic-drama-cum-murder-mystery - where the operative word is unquestionably 'cum'.A slow-building, meticulously crafted, engrossing thriller as provocative for its ideas about desire, transgression and narcissism as for its scenes of man-on-man coupling.Gratuitousness (some scenes are simply porn) overshadows the crux of the tale, namely Franck's libido taking precedence over his conscience and the risk that he may become an accomplice.Alain Guiraudie allows the chosen genre styles and structures to freely blend and merge. The transitions between thriller, comedy and romance are sometimes almost indiscernible.Unsettling, suspenseful and sad, it's a movie that sticks with you long after it's over.Sex, murder, and tension in a tranquil settingThere's too much metaphysical packaging material in the story; it's half Styrofoam peanuts. But its ideas are intriguing and its murky suspense is undeniable.Carefully and often brilliantly creates its own Eden-like universe.Claire Mathon's brilliant cinematography finds an appositely sinister glare in the shimmering water and sunny skies.What sets the engrossing \"Stranger by the Lake\" apart is that its excesses seem to point to a moral purpose beyond shock or entertainment value.This death trip homoerotic thriller, influenced by Hitchcock, is powerful, weird, and intoxicating - until its final scenes.However you read it, the film is compelling and audaciously candid in its erotic charge, while an ending that literally leaves us in the dark is one of the most haunting sign-offs in recent cinema.Stranger By The Lake is by turns a commentary on risk-taking, sex, death and the gay community wrapped up in an art-house thriller with comic notes.The writer-director's attention to the anarchic pull of lust, simultaneously celebrated and reproved here, is sharper than ever.The proximity between sex and death has rarely seemed as intimate as in Stranger by the Lake, the accomplished new film by gifted French director Alain Guiraudie.Writer/director Alain Guiraudie weaves a dark and intriguing tale of desire and menace in a moralistically ambiguous setting, a gay cruising ground.The film's circumscribed scope is simultaneously its most intriguing and most limiting factor.From a single setting, a lakeside gay cruising spot, and an old theme - the link between sex and death - Alain Guiraudie constructs an intricate film.A murderous love story whose serene setting hides a darker purpose.An absorbing and intelligent exploration of queer desire spiced up with thriller elements after one of the studly nudists goes missing.The movie is voyeuristic, sure, but in a way that evokes Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window more than William Friedkin's Cruising.This \"different\" and \"original\" minimalist drama (no music soundtrack, only one scene exhibited) is a meditation on passionate love and violent death among a small group of French homosexuals.A captivating, and enticing watch.You'll leave the cinema breathless, but sated.A career-best effort by French writer-director Alain Guiraudie.Darkly comic and ironic in true French style yet sexier and surprisingly compassionate. I was disappointed by the film's unresolved ending but it is well worthwhile until then. Prudish viewers, however should steer clear.Writer-director Alain Guiraudie gives the proceedings an almost clinical detachment, and consequently \"Stranger by the Lake\" has an air of Hitchcock to it.With its casual camera, simple story, unshaded areas of explaining desire, \"Stranger By the Lake\" is \"Knife in the Water\" without the woman. It doesn't dance about the dangling manhood, though. It shows it. Engorged, enraptured, enraged.There are things to be said about how director Alain Guiraudie creates something of a universe with these basic elements, and expertly builds up a fog of fear-induced erotic attraction/confusion.Never leaving the isolated location and with uneasy detail that doesn't distract from the main plot, Guiraudie's film eventually turns scary when a body washes up and a detective (J\u00e9r\u00f4me Chappatte) starts snooping around and asking probing questions.The film portrays cruising as a danger-seeking and astoundingly repetitive affair, intimately linked to death itself.Guiraudie's sheer frankness about sex is refreshing when so many supposedly grownup films are content to hint coyly and timidly.Classically constructed, as rigid in its construction of suspense as any recent thriller, Alain Guiraudie's \"Stranger by the Lake\" is a masterful work, uncluttered yet lush, formally mechanistic, yet always surprising.While its pace meanders, Stranger by the Lake proves to be an engrossing and darkly humorous watch.See past all the fumblings in the bushes, and writer-director Alain Guarardie's film reveals itself as a chilling psychological drama about the limits of desire, and the attractiveness of self-destruction.Understands desire as something ravenous, terrifying and ridiculous.Perfect, in that it achieves exactly what it meant to... portrays the world of casual sex and cruising with almost journalistic proficiency.While I found the characters interesting, the story was not very compelling and it was slow-moving as well. I learned a lot more about homosexual sex techniques than I wanted to know, and less about the characters than I wanted to know.The sexuality that builds tension early ends up being ultimately a distraction.Franck, so akin to Philip in Somerset Maugham's Of Human Bondage, knows in his heart that he is making a potentially deadly mistake, but his insatiable lust won't hear a word of it.A stunning minimalist erotic thriller that explores with arresting photography and economical use of dialogue how human identity is defined, and sometimes imprisoned, by our desires, drives, and passions.An extraordinarily atmospheric, unsettling film that raises mysteries that, in the end, remain insoluble.Movies must go somewhere, plots must always kick in, and when this one does, that's where \"Stranger by the Lake\" begins to contract into something less creative than its odd setting and compelling compositions would suggest.Guiraudie questions the limits of heedless sexual indulgence at the expense of all other considerations.Will reward film fans who have admired Claude Chabrol and the screen adaptations of Patricia Highsmith.This lake is a sexual refuge, about to be stained by sin and blood.Writer-director Alain Guiraudie has an imagistic talent for suspense and erotic byplay.The film submits a magnificent escalation of concern and characterization that supports the entire effort. The long road to a climatic payoff is well worth the wait.So studiously controlled that it's not an easy picture to watch, but you won't forget it.French filmmaker Alain Guiraudie's tantalizingly erotic fable of love, passion and death.The film is a Hitchcockian murder story in which the Hitchcockian elements-style as well as content-are stood on their heads in order to realize a philosophical vision that's no less sophisticated than Hitchcock's own.The kind of taut, low-key thriller that Roman Polanski and Alfred Hitchcock would very much admire.",

        "document": "Feels as average as an ordinary TV movie.Brick Lane feels slight and late to the table. Still, its pretty musings about small-scale self-actualization can be seductive.the director does not make her heroine's emotional maturation entirely believable, mainly because of the utter unredemptiveness with which Nazneen's husband is viewed until film's end.A poetic and sensitive drama about a Bangladesh village girl's life in England and her valiant struggle to stand on her own in the world with a full and grateful heartThe sort of female empowerment flick that could get a fatwa issued against Sarah Gavron, the intrepid director daring enough to make the pictureFewer incendiary incidents and a red pencil applied to the script might have freed the good movie that's buried somewhere beneath layers of unearned emotional conflict.Direction and the work of the cast are outstanding.Sarah Gavron's tale of a young Bangladeshi woman unwillingly transplanted to London's East End is absorbing enough, moving enough and visually attractive enough to provide a perfectly acceptable night out at the movies.No new ground is explored, however, in this handsomely constructed film. Nazneen's story seems familiar every step of the way.Sarah Gavron's Brick Lane, from a screenplay by Abi Morgan and Laura Jones, is based on the rapturously received 500-page first novel by Monica Ali.Brick Lane, by director Sarah Gavron and Angela's Ashes screenwriter Laura Jones, is, like Mira Nair's film The Namesake, a heartfelt portrait of the new immigrant experience.Relative newcomer Chatterjee is a revelation as Nazneen. It's her character's predicament that holds our interest.A blandly earnest coming-of-age story.Kaushik is remarkable as Chanu, a role that demands he be a buffoonish, yet loving man, intelligent beneath his self-aggrandizing attitudes, oversized ambitions and determined cheerfulness.Brick Lane is lovely to look at and the performances, particularly from Chatterjee and Kaushik, are delightful.A warm bath in comfortable platitudes.... an intriguing and visually interesting film that in aggregate never escapes the genre ghetto. It is another immigration song, a glancing curiosity that never really penetrates our preconceived romantic illusions.As long as Brick Lane remains focused on Nazneen, it succeeds admirably.In Chanu, it creates an indelible protagonist. He thinks he is a man of ideas. He is a man who, when it counts, is full of common sense and uncommon feeling.Despite the fine performances, Brick Lane comes across as a nice soap opera when it promised much more.The daily grind of a Brick Lane Bangladeshi is credibly brought to life in this sensitive and intelligent adaptation of Monica Ali's novel.It is, like all immigrant stories, about identity and Nazneen's journey is both painful and touching.Takes on the theme of 'Where is home'--the place where you were born or the locale of your residence--with freshness and sparkling acting.The director, Sarah Gavron, came through documentaries and BBC TV drama. This is her first feature and she makes the film very sensual, as well as highly controlled.Every conceivable choice on this film was met with the most obvious answer, and every turn comes right out of other movies.A movie whose visuals are lovely to behold and lyrically awash in sensuality and desire, but sets the lives of women back at least a few centuries.Monica Ali's expansive, epic best seller about decades in the life of a sheltered wife from Bangladesh in the titular London neighborhood is transformed into a compact, delicate tale of adultery, extremism, and awakening.Even when 9/11 is invoked the film doesn't so much suggest a melodrama of the heart and spirit as it does an explosion at a fabric store.A weepie that alternates between the poignant and the trite ... The acting is good, but the script is overwrought.Beautifully realized by Sarah Gavron, who fills Nazneen's story with gorgeous visuals and traditional music, creating a film that's dramatic, romantic and even erotic at times.Rich and subtle in its characterisation, Brick Lane is an enlightening tale about the breadth and depth of ordinary lives, how they intersect with history, and where they remain hidden away.The film is full of fabrics and shimmer and embroiderings of light and colour, giving a slender story the shy blush of art.Monica Ali's sensitive sprawling text about a Bangledeshi wife (Chatterjee) forced into an east London marriage gets a sanded-down blandification as it makes its lurch onto the big screen.Tannishtha Chatterjee, known in India for film and theatre work, is excellent as the vulnerable, isolated young woman who gradually builds herself into a resilient survivor who can smile and tame the pain of her worldTannishtha Chatterjee perfectly captures the emotional awakening of shy heroine Nazneen.Underwhelming.The romance at the heart of Brick Lane never comes alive. Chatterjee is doleful and weepy, Simpson enervated.Although well-acted and heartfelt, it provokes shrugged shoulders rather than the tears it's clearly striving for.Quietly effective, acted with resource and directed with the kind of patient skill it needs.Gavron's movie finds an unfashionably gentle, human optimism in the face of all this, and a sympathetic performance from Chatterjee makes it plausible.Monica Ali's best-selling debut novel about life in London's Bangladeshi quarter gets a sensitive treatment from director Sarah Gavron, deftly condensing its sprawling narrative without sacrificing colour or texture.Gavron cleverly outlines the closed-in boundaries of Nazneen's Brick Lane.It's a hard heart that isn't immersed by this delicately told tale.A depressing, static drama that will have heads lolling backwards and eyes drooping wherever it plays.The kind of meaningless middlebrow sludge that passes for \"quality movie-making\" in some of the more conservative sectors of the British film industryDon't expect too many surprises from this low-key story of a Bangladeshi woman who learns to stand on her own two feet after years of stultifying arranged marriage.Brick Lane is beautifully shot and superbly acted but the story is slow-moving and ultimately rather uneventful.The daily grind of a Brick Lane Bangladeshi is credibly brought to life in this sensitive and intelligent adaptation of Monica Ali's novel.Brick Lane is beautifully acted and written (by Abi Morgan and Laura Jones) so its themes are touched upon glancingly rather than with full force.Depth of character, such a distinctive quality of Ali's book, is sacrificed for simpler strokes and shallower dimensions, with an undue emphasis placed by helmer Sarah Gavron and lenser Robbie Ryan on gorgeous pictures.Based on Monica Ali's bestselling novel, this is an insightful look at a woman searching across cultural barriers for a place to belong. Not only is it a strong story, but it's great to see such an involving film set in London's Asian-Muslim community.The film's heart can't be faulted, but its head is working in a regrettably low gear.Brick Lane is so lovely that even a simple shot of empty hangers in a closet shimmers.Poignant and subtle, it tackles cross-cultural conflict and racial intolerance.[A] quietly observant and quite beautiful adaptation of the Monica Ali novel.Taken for what it is, Brick Lane is something entirely its own.Chanu, a torrent of frustration who seems to be no more happy with the union than his wife is, confronts Karim in a memorable scene that packs a spark the rest of the film lacks.Brick Lane is a grown-up movie. It recognizes that there are different kinds of love and that some of them don't involve happily-ever-afters.Small, intimate and achingly modern, Brick Lane is a lovely study involving both one woman's awakening and the inevitability of cross-cultural pollination.The story has many themes to contend with and sometimes accordingly becomes unfocused, but when fully controlled it's also quite moving and surprising.The slant is feminist, but the most interesting character is not the saintly and long-suffering wife but her initially ridiculous husband (wonderfully played by Satish Kaushik).Adapted from the 2003 Monica Ali novel, Brick Lane is one of those feminist cries in the dark in which the heroine, a saintly sufferer, is more admirable than interesting.One of those poorly chosen movie titles that does not do justice to the beautiful story told within.Its flat, static quality belies the novel's richness.While the film tackles the issue of what the concept of 'home' means for expats and emigrants, it can also be seen as a coming-of-age story for a woman in her mid-30s.As the plot unfolds, it becomes apparent that director Sarah Gavron also finds attractive people more sympathetic, and this is Brick Lane's undoing.As Nazneen, Tannishtha Chatterjee proves to be the quiet force that drives the film, ably projecting a depth of emotion with few words.Sarah Gavron's adaptation of Monica Ali's novel is a thoughtful and often evocative drama of identity and assimilation...Sarah Gavron's adaptation of Monica Ali's novel is a thoughtful and often evocative drama of identity and assimilation...Ultimately hopeful, Brick Lane feels careful enough to connect with its intentions, leaving behind an engaging, turbulent picture that pays careful concentration to the tender nuances of the longing, unfulfilled heart.[The film] hits all the clich\u00e9s of romantic literary adaptation: montage, letters read aloud in voice-over, a swelling musical score.Lazily relies upon the book's prestige to get by.Brick Lane is about characters who have depth and reality, who change and learn, who have genuine feelings. And it keeps on surprising us, right to the end.A sense of isolation and struggle for identity in an oppressive culture wash away superfluous formula, leaving a lovely tranquility in their wake.A sensitive and occasionally poetic film, Brick Lane is an absorbing tale of personal empowerment and emotional growth.Weighty tearjerker with mature themes.It's a testament to Kaushik's acting ability that he turns what could have been an odious character into a quite likeable one.Brick Lane has beautiful scenery and some enjoyable moments but leaves the viewer feeling the need to find the book to get the rest of the story.Interview: These two incredibly insightful women (director Sarah Gavron and lead actress Tannishtha Chatterjee) talk about the essence in creating this amazing female lead and an overall perspective on the Muslim experience in London.Gavron coaxes good performances from her cast, and she captures the look and feel of council housing in East End London...Little more than an old story dressed up in contemporary trappings, but in this case they elevate the formula.[Chaterjee's] is a face that finds a profound eloquence in silence, transmitting an insistent intensity to the emotions revealed...an economically poignant melodrama about a young Muslim girl's fragile mindset and the journey that leads to her self-discovery...relentlessly affecting in mind and consciousness.Stripped of a mediating point of view, the film is just a series of pretty pictures and awkwardly connected incidents.To hint that a heroine might have any flaws whatsoever would be just a bit too modern for this picture.Well-acted and grounded in reality.[A] glossy but overly efficient drama that, like Nazneen's husband, is ultimately too ineffectual to make much of a dent.For most of the movie, we feel as trapped as she does, and the lurching narrative seems anything but novelistic.In Brick Lane's London, Nazneen is confined by a series of small rooms and doorways, narrow streets and muted colors.Certainly touching, even heart-rending at times, and it mostly steers clear of the didacticism and sentimentality its subject matter often invites. But it never takes the full measure of its modest heroine, and makes her world a bit too small.Where it's going all seems predetermined, but the visual journey is lovely, Robbie Ryan's camera turning even council-housing London into something optically enchanting.",

        "document": "Out Cold is destined to live on as a constant of late-night cable film.The direction is pedestrian at best, and the laughs are little more than sporadic, nervous chuckles.Doesn't ever quite seem to elevate itself above an '80s 'youth against the establishment' genre film.Out Cold, which seems to have been written by a head trauma victim, is so dumb you'd think 'spoof,' except that it isn't funny.Could have been...a \"Caddyshack\" of winter sports. But the inexperienced and bumbling Malloys never even try to graduate the picture off the bunny slope.Not only unexpectedly enjoyable, but also kind of sweet.What really drags this sloppy but functional movie down are the cringe-inducing moments of homophobia masquerading as political correctness.There's a good deal of stupid, a lot of silly, hordes of dumb and a bunch of hackneyed, but no funny.When Lee Majors can steal every scene he's in, your movie's in trouble.While much of the movie is unspeakably vile, the scenes of snowboarding action -- featuring stunt doubles, no doubt -- are undeniably impressive.Dim-witted even by adolescent gross-out-movie standards.More Caddyshack than Casablanca.As in the old beach movies, a great deal of screen time is devoted to the astounding exploits of stunt doubles, who here are riding powdered snow rather than waves.The resulting film is an incoherent debacle, more likely to turn people off of the pastime it allegedly celebrates than win any converts.As if conceived during a Dukes of Hazzard shooting hiatus, Out Cold may be retro but it's sans daisy dukes.Like watching an hour-and-a-half-long Mountain Dew commercial.Out Cold isn't the worst movie ever made. It is, however, one of the most pointless.The title reflects the condition viewers are advised to be in while the picture unspools...about as appetizing as an anchovy- flavored sno-cone.Really the only highlight here is the unscripted outtakes that run before the closing credits.Lame, sophomoric and pretty much what you'd expect for a film such as this, Out Cold is likely to disappear from theaters about on pace with a snowball's chance in you know where.No brains, no headache.Out Cold is like the Caddyshack of snowboarding, just with a fraction of the laughs.I can't imagine why anyone would pay money to see this sorry excuse for a film.Most will find this one as thin as the mountain air.It's 90 minutes of agony, buried under an avalanche of gross-out jokes and goofy geeks.It sort of sucks, but you'll still secretly have a pretty good time watching it.While the presence of pro boarders doing their thing might be a selling point for enthusiasts, the predominantly lame goings-on will leave others snow-bored.If you've made a movie in which former TV star Lee Majors ... is the funniest person present, then you have surely made a movie that sucks a lot.Even though no one in the film breaks a leg, Out Cold is as lame as it gets.The best that can be said of Out Cold is that it is generally more lame than obnoxious.Funnier than it has any right to be and it's generally enjoyable.Basically a low-rent remake of the 1984 low-rent teenage sex comedy Hot Dog ... The Movie.I would mention that Out Cold boasts some pretty impressive snowboarding sequences, but so do most TV commercials.How appropriate this overcooked turkey opened over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend! And I'm here to give it a basting.What can you say about a movie that includes its outtake bloopers reel before the closing credits?The title says all there is to say about this pathetic hunk of moron-bait.A formulaic and predictable film.In failing in every base it tries to cover, there's no point in seeing Out Cold, for such preferable alternatives exist.Out Cold is basically Porky's in the snow, and it's a pale imitation at that. You can't go into this movie expecting anything innovative.As if to justify a serious discussion of this comedy before dissing it, some reviewers have pointed out that it evokes Casablanca.Although its main plot is a disposable low-rent ripoff and its leading players generally bland and undistinguished, there are some truly amusing supporting characters.Funnier than Woody Allen's last four movies, more exciting than Tarkovski's The Sacrifice, Out Cold will play best if your first legal beer is still far enough into the future to seem a vision of the promised land.Just don't waste your time or money.Its only redeeming value is the killer snowboarding scenes.Out Cold is essentially a spineless, unfunny Animal House. The pretence of plot is distracting and insulting.There's really nothing to recommend about Out Cold.The result is so derivative, they should've called it Eskimo Pie.",

        "document": "Rockwell is wonderful throughout, capturing Barris' inherent sleaziness and insecurity as well as, well, the vision of the man who could be called the godfather of reality TV....so busy having fun it isn't burdened with being important -- though I can't think of another movie that has as many important things to say about ambition and failure.Clooney's version of a beautiful mind blends Kaufman lunacy with a surreal story.The evil twin of A Beautiful Mind: take out the false life-affirming tone and moral clarity from Howard's movie, add some nasty humour and you get box-office poison.It doesn't quite deserve the gong, but there are more fascinating acts than \"Confessions of a Dangerous Mind.\"The scintillating aspect of Confessions of a Dangerous Mind lies in trying to discern fact from fiction - or at least fantasy.Peddles skepticism while offering up narrative absurdities so fanciful that they must be true.The movie is like a party that you can't remember attending the next morning....an aggressively unpleasant comedy-a raunchy, bloodthirsty epic of self-flagellating sex guilt and apocalyptic self-hatred. It's also about the host of The Gong Show.I got tired of looking at George's butt in Solaris, and I felt the same of Rockwell here.Rockwell is engaging and wildly funny...skillfully directed with flair and personality by George Clooney.Just isn't as weird as it ought to be.Rockwell delivers a performance admirable in its hustling sweatiness.Stealthily thought-provoking and brashly entertaining.A powerful and creative film.The movie is, finally, an enigma, not because of Barris's monstrous fibbing, but because it resists being experienced as satire for the sake of its own satirical integrity.Brilliantly stylized to suggest its time period and the hero's questionable, if dangerous, state of mind and fever-dreamlike recollections, Confessions never fails to entertain and intrigue.Instead of exploring this dangerous mind, Clooney plays it safe, making his freshman film deadly dull as a result.Clooney has everything under control here from the storytelling to the steady hand of a director with an eye of confidence for the cinema.This cynical, ludicrous, self-indulgent, dark comedy is like \"A Beautiful Mind\" on an acid trip as it chronicles Chuck Barris's \"downward spiral of debauchery.\"The overload of murders and double-crosses make Barris's life seem more and more like the folly of a screenwriter's imagination.A stunning Sam Rockwell's 'fessing up anchors an imaginative film.Confessions of a Dangerous Mind has the feeling of the kind of film from the 1970s that Clooney studied before making this movie: loose, adventurous, witty, occasionally out of control....should've been a lot better.Odd, but Awesome! George Clooney's directorial debut is simply spectacular. This is one smashing film!The movie feels like it's going to be great, and it carries on feeling that way for a long time, but takeoff just never happens.Confessions Of A Dangerous Mind may not be in the Citizen Kane class, but George Clooney's first foray behind the camera does boast similarly bravura technique and an infectious sense of joy in the filmmaking process.Confessions of a Dangerous Mind is freakin' brilliant. Sam Rockwell gives a whack-you-upside-the-head dose of his talent!Bounces around like the smarter and weirder older brother of Spielberg's Catch Me If You Can.Because of movies like this, nostalgia just ain't what it used to be....a one-note character study about an unhappy, insecure, delusional paranoiac, whose assassin gimmick wears thin almost before it gets started.Clooney has made a stylish debut, wisely making his movie resemble the wacky game shows Barris dreamt up.Directing for the first time, Clooney turns out to be a natural when it comes to parody...Os universos de Chuck Barris e Charlie Kaufman s\u0103o complementares. E igualmente fascinantes.Confessions Of A Dangerous Mind is the latest, and most promising evolution of Clooney's career. . .A blast from beginning to end and shows first-time director George Clooney is equal parts fearless, brilliant and perhaps daft. But an intriguing daftness it is.[Clooney's] debut can be accused of being a bit undisciplined, but it has a tremendous, offbeat sense of style and humor that suggests he was influenced by some of the filmmakers who have directed him, especially the Coen brothers and Steven Soderbergh.An attractive, charming film that has fun with its period settings, its goofy plot and its off-kilter performances.This somber, draggy movie, which is nothing like the breezy, lunatic comedy its TV ads promise, takes Barris' claims at face value and plays them for stone-faced drama.The film may be a pleasure to look at, but in the end it's so uninhabited it becomes a chore to watch.Who would've thought a movie about Chuck Barris could be so rich and entertaining?The story winks at show-biz insider parody -- you might end up yearning for more quality time with Bob Eubanks.[Clooney] and Kaufman have crafted a truly bizarro masterpiece -- the kind made for instant cult status and midnight runs.Thanks to Clooney, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind is colorful, fast-moving and fun, but never without its bittersweet hint of madness.Maybe the title should have been Confusions of a Dangerous Mind, though the confusion, in this case, can be pretty sublime.Clooney's direction sets a unique tone that lets us laugh at, hope for and pity Barris as we tag along for a herky-jerky ride through his memories.Confessions isn't a movie that deserves to be gonged. But it doesn't quite merit the '516 dollars and 32 cent' prize, either.Not only intriguing as a story but great to look at, a marriage of bright pop images from the 1960s and 1970s and dark, cold spyscapes that seem to have wandered in from John le Carre.I have to confess there's nothing very dangerous going on in a comedy that is neither as twistedly weird as your average Gong Show contestant nor as arch as an interview on The Newlywed Game.A brilliant mix of television history, artistic license, and resilient self-inflation.Clooney makes a sharply entertaining directorial debut.Startlingly Clooney shows great flair in his foremost engagement -- terrific formation, daring camera movements, creative storytelling.Witty, smart and absurdly funny.Rockwell lets us see all the joy, lust, self-pity, and rage with which Barris gonged himself.Rockwell is definitely the star of the movie. He's brilliant within the limitations of the part, tapping into Barris' mannerisms and tics in an uncanny way.Confessions may not be a straightforward bio, nor does it offer much in the way of Barris' motivations, but the film is an oddly fascinating depiction of an architect of pop culture.It's tremendously clever, but ultimately pointless.This movie is full of surprises, starting with the fact that it's one of the most dramatically successful film biographies in memory.Comedy both surreal and silly, which comfortably fits the characterization of Barris as a cynical yet pathetic sap who seeks fame and respect by trying to come up with tv-show ideas.An irresistible sham.Une biographie mi-s\u00e9rieuse, mi-comique au style ind\u00e9niable.The problem with making a movie about a hollow man is that, when things start to get heavy, you're stuck with nothingness at the core.While somewhat less than it might have been, the film is a good one, and you've got to hand it to director George Clooney for biting off such a big job the first time out.In his directorial debut, George Clooney delivers a highly stylized biopic that showcases the confessions of an absurd mind rather than a dangerous one.Not necessarily the overwhelming pleasure that I might've imagined.If it's true, how scary is that? If it's not true, it's a great idea for a story.Hypnotic in its lunacy and sorta plaintive in its depiction of blustery patheticness.The ingredients were there for Confessions of a Dangerous Mind to become a cult classic, but the resulting film is a tedious Hollywood yawner.As crazy a story as you might imagine it to be. It is also entertaining in a darkly comic kind of way.Kaufman, Clooney, and company have interpreted Barris's story beautifully, but it was a flawed story to begin with.Chuck Barris looks like Saint Mozart compared to today's producersClooney impresses with his sure directorial hand.far less compelling than the trailer indicates-a film that you may not immediately 'Gong' while watchingConfessions is without a doubt a memorable directorial debut from King Hunk.As director, Clooney uses his visuals to create a great story. However, the script is more of a teether for Charlie Kaufman and is overwhelmed by taking the material way too literally.As a first-time director, Clooney makes a huge visual impact, enlisting cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel to help create the film's stellar look.The fact that Confessions looks absolutely gorgeous and unique is merely icing on the cake. Clooney and Kaufman spin this yarn for all its worth, and in this day and age it's worth quite a lot.It is the bizarre type of laughless comedy that only a film critic could admire. Our packed audience was as silent as that at a funeral.Rockwell is stunning in his first lead performance, and in any other year, this would be a showy enough turn to be a lock for an Oscar nomination.This astonishingly stylish film also marks Clooney's debut as a director. And it shows such promise that it'll leave you looking forward to whatever he decides to do next, even though he'll have a hard time topping this quirky gem.An entertaining film, if not exactly an insightful one.Clooney has made a remarkable, if unsettled and unsettling picture.Confessions isn't always coherent, but it's sharply comic and surprisingly touching, so hold the gong.Go see it and enjoy.A satisfying trip for idiot box fans who like their kitschy television nostalgia mixed with a hint of imagination.Confessions of a Dangerous Mind works best as a rollicking trip through the pop culture of the '60s and '70s.Mr. Clooney, Mr. Kaufman and all their collaborators are entitled to take a deep bow for fashioning an engrossing entertainment out of an almost sure-fire prescription for a critical and commercial disaster....sort of a red velvet twin to Steven Spielberg's pastel Catch Me If You CanA dazzling, visually assured movie with elaborate set pieces that make you say, 'Gee, how'd they do that?'A picture that is surely one of the oddest ever made.Not quite as brilliant, quirky or insightful at it might have been or as some would like, the film nevertheless kept me interested and entertained most of the time.It's a smart, stylish, eminently watchable movie that nonetheless feels a little empty at the end.In his promising directorial debut, Clooney gets away with most of the flourishes he allows himself.Is it an irreverent comedy, but without laughs? Or an espionage thriller without thrills?A darkly enjoyable roller-coaster ride.Almost as weird as Barris himself.The movie makes a case for itself through sheer oddness and perversity.Clooney, who on the basis of this movie has a big career ahead of him behind the camera, demonstrates a real flair for visual comedy.Neither revelatory nor truly edgy--merely crassly flamboyant and comedically labored.Now as a former Gong Show addict, I'll admit it, my only complaint is that we didn't get more re-creations of all those famous moments from the show.A good piece of work more often than not.Add yet another hat to a talented head, Clooney's a good director.Barris' CIA assassinations make a neat metaphor for indiscriminate cultural degradation and personal emotional failings, but neither Rockwell nor Clooney are successful in getting us to feel either love or loathing for the manFast and loose, leaving the string-tying to an audience savvy from years of immersion in an ever-festering, increasingly perverse cultural stew.There's nothing terribly witty, clever, satirical, or irreverent about Charlie Kauffman's screenplay.Clooney's direction successfully steals from the best of pal Steven Soderbergh's work.A head-clearing, mind-blowing blast from the past -- one of the year's best.Clooney has not only made one of the best debuts since Spike Jonze's Being John Malkovich, but one of the best films of the year.Darkly funny, surprising and very enjoyable, there's enough here to suggest that Clooney should direct again.A genuine mixed bag, full of entertaining moments but also bogged down by Clooney's overwhelming desire to emulate his frequent screen collaborator Steven Soderbergh.Clooney zips through a very funny first act, before becoming a little bogged down as the action enters John le Carr\u00e9 territory.If for nothing else, go see Rockwell's performance. It's about time for him to bust out into bigger and better roles, and if it happens, this movie will be why.Marks an auspicious debut for George Clooney in the role of director -- a job he already seems to be a natural at.Clooney's ambition renders Denzel's \"Good Will Fisher\" / \"Finding Fisher\" debut pedestrian in comparison.The movie isn't out to answer questions, but to show you just how deep & intesting those questions can get. In the mean time, it's damn entertaining.Too succinct and too straightforward for its enigmatic subject....A wacky movie about a wacky person, a film whose details we are never really sure we are supposed to believe. But perhaps this uncertainty is what makes it so engaging.Clooney directs this film always keeping the balance between the fantastic and the believable...both overstuffed and undernourished... The film can't be called a solid success, although there's plenty of evidence here to indicate Clooney might have better luck next time.The concoction entertains from beginning to end, though the lessons of Barris' life are as slippery as his facts.Reinforces the talents of screenwriter Charlie Kaufman, creator of Adaptation and Being John Malkovich.The movie is compulsively watchable even if it never quite convinces you that it's much more than a fanciful story.Undeniably fascinating as it unfolds but ultimately not very satisfying.As a director, Clooney doesn't have an original idea to speak of, but he knows how to swipe the best indie-approved moves.You won't believe much of it, but you will laugh at the audacity, at the who's who casting and the sheer insanity of it all.Celebrity and pop culture are areas on which Clooney is well-equipped to comment, but the other aspect of Barris' life -- clandestine meetings with shadowy figures who may simply be delusions -- leave him at a loss.Throws out so much and so quickly that the hit-to-miss ratio is rather poor.A magnificent directorial debut...Sam Rockwell is one of the best actors on the planet. Original, bizarre, and consistently entertaining.Even though Confessions of a Dangerous Mind can be too hip and too glib in its attempt to wring universal truths from Barris' sordid delusions, any movie that stars both Rutger Hauer and the Unknown Comic is all right by me.One of the year's most weirdly engaging and unpredictable character pieces.Although delightfully overzealous, Clooney's field trip of loose-ended frivolity sputters aimlessly in our attempts to embrace a complicated soul being presented as a sympathetic human question mark.With this film, Rockwell is now a leading man, a force in Hollywood.Un prodigio narrativo muy diferente a todo lo que suele producir Hollywood, pero no por capricho de un director sino al servicio de una historia y de un punto de vista.Noir fantasy with the pop funkiness of '70s game showsNever mind whether you buy the stuff about Barris being a CIA hit man. The kooky yet shadowy vision Clooney sustains throughout is daring, inventive and impressive.A film so tedious that it is impossible to care whether that boast is true or not.Brimming with slightly self-conscious directorial panache, the movie zips between nearly three decades, fantasy and reality without ever really deciding how seriously it wants to take itself.Directing a movie is no picnic, but I'll be damned if Mr. Clooney doesn't make it seem like fun.Clooney directs it! How could it be any good?A terrific actor, a handsome movie star and now an accomplished director--damn you, Mr. Clooney, for making it that much more unfair for the average joe likes of myself.An intriguing, bizarre and challenging film that invites us into a world filled with larger-than-life characters and strange occurrences.Well-acted and well-written, for mature teens+.Clooney wanted Kaufman's script delivered without corruption or softening. He has overcorrected and made a glum, almost listless movie.Fact and possible fiction amble to a photo finish as one of pop culture's nuttiest milestones.George Clooney proves he's quite a talented director and Sam Rockwell shows us he's a world-class actor with Confessions of a Dangerous Mind.There's nothing dangerous about Chuck Barris' mind. Unfortunately, there's not much interesting about it either.unfolds in a striking visual palette of washed out colors and deep shadows, almost as if we're watching it on an old television set whose picture tube is about to burn outWhile the results are often stylish, interesting and humorous, the film unfortunately lacks focus and fails to resonate on an emotional level.The American film of the season -- and maybe of the year, or the last couple of years...If nothing else, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind ought to make Sam Rockwell a star.With a dedication to seamless scene transitions not witnessed since, maybe, 1992's Hoffa, Clooney keeps the film light, and even a little fun.[The movie] makes up in vitality what it loses in veracity.It's deftly written by Charlie Kaufman.By taking Chuck Barris seriously, Charlie Kaufman gets to the heart of the true gamesman that he was; by not taking him seriously, George Clooney has made a movie debut that is just a game.Confessions of a Dangerous Mind is a delightfully wicked indulgence that plays with its audience just as much as it plays with its subject.",

        "document": "The Steve Jobs film we want, and deserve.I came away with the feeling that the filmmakers were practically implying that his early death at 56 was some kind of karmic payback.This is a swift and searing attempt to pull back the curtain on Jobs and, in the process, investigate the relationship between the myth and the man.There's something both sterile and overwhelmingly magnificent about Steve Jobs at the same time.Sorkin's long-held faith in the abilities of great men to lead humanity forward is transmuted by his lack of affinity for technology into something with more perspective and plangency.This is simultaneously Sorkin's most satisfying movie script and Boyle's most graceful work as a director.Racing in high gear from start to finish, Danny Boyle's electric direction temperamentally complements Sorkin's highly theatrical three-act study, which might one day be fascinating to experience in a staged setting.features an Oscar-winning (in a year without a slavery or Holocaust picture, just mail it to him) performance by Michael FassbenderA whirlwind tour through the computer age with a flawed human at its center.In many ways the film reflects its hero's brilliance. It's a scintillating construction, though one that sometimes feels like a product launch in its own right.Fassbender delivers a mesmeric performance as Jobs...What's most difficult about Sorkin's intricate fantasy is not acknowledging Jobs' darkness, but setting aside all hope of seeing the real man who inspired it.Fassbender doesn't really resemble Jobs (until the end, when the mock-turtlenecks and New Balance sneaks come out), but he gives an enthralling performance as a man who truly changed the world.A typically Sorkin-esque collection of high octane, highly literate, verbal jousts that manages the neat trick of exalting Steve Jobs while also crucifying him.Steve Jobs is a fascinating study of a man, explaining who he was but never making a judgment about who he is. The movie lets audiences compute that for themselves.Kinetic & enigmatic - it's extraordinary entertainment, eminently suitable for its iconic, yet inscrutable subject.Rigorous cinema at its finest, wielding dialogue, setting, cinematography, editing and performance to create ... an \"impressionistic portrait\" of the face of Apple.The film feels so electric while you're watching, it's hard to believe that after two hours, it doesn't even get to the iPod, let alone the iPhone.Steve Jobs mostly succeeds, crafting a human portrait of a tech leader who struggled behind the scenes to be greater than his failings.\"Steve Jobs\" is a buzzingly entertaining movie about an obdurate radical with a broken operating system who still managed to transform the world around us, how we communicate, and the course of technological history.Exaggerated, transcendent, and brazen in its effort to entertain ... The best concert I've been to this year.A fascinating character study.What Sorkin and Boyle have to offer is not a warts-and-all portrait but the suggestion that there is something heroic about a wart.If I feel I now know less about Jobs than I did before, that may be a good thing.For a movie that resists the traditional biopic movie formula of career-high-and-low flashbacks (witness Ashton Kutcher's disastrous \"Jobs\" - now streaming on Netflix), \"Steve Jobs\" is a droning tone poem of a character-study.Capably shot, well acted (notwithstanding Kate Winslet's shape-shifting accent), its score propulsive, if a little too insistent, it's a finely crafted piece of work. But as a film, I found it nearly insufferable.Aaron Sorkin's dazzling and dizzying screenplay is the star of this show which is blessed by crackerjack direction from Danny Boyle and a great Michael Fassbender in the title role.It's not a conventional film and is anything but a biopic...but once you buckle in for this ride, it will be one you won't forget anytime soon.Aaron Sorkin has created a larger-than-life monstre sacr\u00e9 who can rage across three acts of dazzling dialogue and constant movement like a latter-day Lear.Written, directed and acted to perfection, and so fresh and startling in conception and execution that it leaves you awed. Fassbender rips through the role of the volcanic Jobs. Is he really that good? Hell, yeah.\"Birdman\" for the tech sector.Steve Jobs is an arresting, razor-sharp piece of human drama that probes the slippery divide between persona and person.A triumph in terms of Aaron Sorkin's screenwriting, Boyle's direction, the ensemble acting led by Michael Fassbender and Kate Winslet, and certainly set for awards attention ...The energy is relentless and the actors all more than meet the challenge of not only keeping up with Sorkin's trademark, rat-a-tat patter but also making it sing.There's undeniable craftsmanship here, especially in Fassbender's confident and transformative performance, but Sorkin's script fails to shout and quip its way to anything approaching dramatic vibrancy.As sharp and slick as Steve Jobs is, it ends up feeling more interested in entertainment than enlightenment.Steve Jobs doesn't reach the zeitgeisty highs of Sorkin's other tech-minded film, but goodness is everyone on board and running smoothly.Like the man it profiles, Steve Jobs is easy to admire and difficult to love.From a performance standpoint, the film stands near the top of ensembles and individualized works seen in 2015. Fassbender approaches Jobs with a familiarity. He finds sarcasm to be a second language, and repugnancy to be a way of life.To paraphrase the old company slogan. . . . Aaron Sorkin thinks different.A mesmerizing and invigorating piece of filmmaking, with a high-wire Aaron Sorkin stamp all over it.Danny Boyle's film can't help but land in the same hagiographizing place as nearly every single other Great Man biopic churned out by the studio powers that be.More a Rorschach test than a film telling us what to think.iNcredibleWhile you have to give Sorkin and Boyle credit for attempting an unconventional structure, it's a choice that arguably only works thanks to the contributions of a stellar ensemble.Compelling portrait of Apple genius has lots of swearing.It is an interesting film for people who have seen many of the other movies and TV specials about Jobs. This one is a different take and a very worthwhile and interesting one at that.As scathingly played by Fassbender, Jobs looks almost as sleek and perfected as one of his computers.Looking for a film in which the drama rests on fighting over whether the original Macintosh will say hello over the machine's speaker? Then this is for you.Fassbender looks enough like Jobs that it's not distracting, and he finds a voice for the character.It's wonderful in spots, maddening in spots, and entirely too sentimental in its ending. But it's also unquestionably worth seeing.It's fitting, I suppose, that a movie about the complicated man behind Apple be complicated as well and, in that sense, this adventurous Danny Boyle/Aaron Sorkin spin succeeds. But, is that dazzle enough?A smart, hugely entertaining film that all but bristles with crackling creative energy.Can you be a nice guy, and a great man? Steve Jobs is the case in point, and \"Steve Jobs\" says no.Boyle's film is a short-sighted, albeit wonderfully acted and entertaining, look into the life of Steve Jobs that never quite captures a bigger-picture mentality.Steve Jobs and all of the characters around him fail to come to life in any absorbing fashion. They're not real people; they're all hashtags.It's a high wire act that might leave some feeling left behind. Somehow, though, Boyle pulls it off not by backing off the speechifying but by leaning into it and allowing it to sing.Feels like a series of beautifully and meticulously crafted tiles in a half-finished mosaic; you can admire the pieces but still come away feeling like you've been deprived of the whole.An ingenious structure and Aaron Sorkin's typically sharp dialogue elevate this exploration of the Apple icon beyond the standard biopic.As a technical achievement, it's interesting, if not perfect. But for a story of our time, I can't imagine anything better.An enthralling performance by Michael Fassbender fuels this brilliant, infuriating and richly unconventional take on the life of an American visionary.The tension between Boyle's restless energy and Sorkin's tendency to run in place drives the movie.a sensational filmA damn near perfect effort with words and performances that will reign come Oscar time.Screenwriter Aaron Sorkin, who's written about America's Great Flawed Men with such fire and hyperarticulate pathos that he's threatened to become one himself, outdoes his work on The Social Network with an even sharper and more savage script.Fassbender thrillingly commands Steve Jobs, a movie that takes care to entertain while also informing.It's all too neatly staged to make for dynamic cinema, even if the dialogue does crackle with a delicious nastiness.Danny Boyle and Aaron Sorkin's Steve Jobs is a fantastically entertaining cinema.This self-proclaimed Apple hater wasn't buying. But I admit the product still looks great.The trick to enjoying an Aaron Sorkin project is to never take it as seriously as he does. With the supremely entertaining \"Steve Jobs,\" the Oscar-winning writer presents us with a Charles Foster Kane-like figure and then goes on a hunt for Rosebuds.Steve Jobs is an exciting piece of iconoclasm: a talky, charged thriller for the brain that offers an intimate interpretation of who Jobs really was, even as it shrewdly undercuts many of the high-tech-saviour claims that have been made for him.Though Michael Fassbender contributes an Oscar-worthy performance, the fragmentary nature of this biopic is distracting.It's a clich\u00e9 to say that Apple changed the world, but how and why did that happen? \"Steve Jobs\" is robust and entertaining, but the answer it provides is incomplete.It is a formally audacious, intellectually energized entertainment, a powerful challenge to the lazy conventions of Hollywood storytelling and a feast for connoisseurs of contemporary screen acting.Neither hagiography nor hatchet job, Steve Jobs is a dazzling artistic interpretation of one of the modern techno-giants and a terrific piece of filmmaking.",

        "document": "Southland is ridiculous in much the same way the Austin Powers movies are, but it's played straight.It's not hard to understand. It's just who would care about what this is about?Unlike the world, Southland Tales starts with a bang but ends with a whimper. Richard Kelly's opus of a film is little more than sensory overload meant to look like a political statement on the state of privacy, the war, news and celebrities.One of the most confusing, ridiculous, pretentious and disastrous cinematic train wrecks I've ever seen.Richard Kelly's wildly ambitious and widely loathed Southland Tales now seems among the most believable works of film futurism ever made in this country.An incomprehensible, self-indulgent mess of post-apocalyptic anxiety and political paranoia, a confusion of half-baked social critiques, pop-culture references, sci-fi whimsicalities, and anti-corporate satire straining for significance.It's as though Kelly has taken all his obsessions and interests and tried to jam them into one narrative, no matter how admirably diverse and incompatible they are.Southland Tales really is a guy movie, right down to all the sci-fi, comic book and porn references...The actors barely comprehend their lines. The pop-culture references are lame. Nearly every moment falls flat. And it's boring.By the time the movie rolls into its third hour, it's exhausted most of its comic energy, leaving you disoriented and unable to remember much of what you just saw.A colleague recently burbled to me that Southland Tales is \"the worst movie of the year,\" and I could not disagree more. Yes, it's astonishingly bad, but it's far too demented to warrant that ultimate dishonor.Imagine world populated entirely by Donnie Darkos. That's Southland Tales, and it takes only a few minutes for it to become completely unhinged.A gonzo, unsettling, semi-coherent, barnstorming near-masterpiece that had me glued to my seat in anticipation of witnessing how far this multi-dimensional funhouse of madness could go.There are so many ideas sliding into Kelly's swirling vortex of pop culture overload and apocalyptic forecasting that it's understandable not to find coherence in it.Kelly might yet develop into an important filmmaker, but this undisciplined effort demonstrates the downside of a creative mind with no filter.Kelly seemed to have a lot on his mind when he assembled this movie, and it looks as if he put it together thinking it would be his last.Ultimately no more than an agglomeration of such high-caloric, giddy treats.Fitfully engaging but half-baked.This is how the review starts, not with overwhelming praise, but confused disappointment.In a world of mediocre, formulaic fare that is like everything else that has come before it, Southland Tales stands invigoratingly apart from the crowd. It's ballsy, fascinatingly different and thoroughly commendable.Swings from dark comedy to political message film to science fiction, with occasional dips into noir, religion and even a musical number featuring Justin Timberlake.If Donnie Darko was Kelly's Eraserhead, then maybe Southland Tales is his Dune, an unfortunate folly before a more substantial, velveteen Blue period.Southland Tales has a mood unlike anything I've seen: dread that morphs into kitsch and then back again. It's a film that tried my patience, and one I couldn't shake off.Pointless, rambling, and irritating.In its willful, self-involved eccentricity, Southland Tales is really something else. Kelly's movie may not be entirely coherent, but that's because there's so much it wants to say.An example of a sophomore jinx encountered by radically experimental directors after their first effort proved to have more traction with audiences and critics than they had anticipated.As the follow-up to his debut feature, the unexpectedly enduring teen-movie/sci-fi hybrid Donnie Darko, writer-director Richard Kelly has crafted an even more ambitious and far-reaching storyAs in Kelly's previous film, Southland's flaws, and its scope, are magnificently earnest; the guy is in way over his head, but his flailing is extravagant.Unusual and extremely ambitious with an alternate reality that is entirely absorbing; Southland Tales is Richard Kelly's magnum opus that only a small few are able to recognize. Thankfully, those small few are pimps. And pimps don't commit suicide.Writer-director Richard Kelly throws a lot at the wall. The problem, if that's what we should call it, is that everything sticks. That's bad news for those who like some narrative clarity, and great news for those who enjoy bonkers wall art.Dude, I have no idea.Not much improvement over the vfirst, severely flawed version.Has the galvanic pulse of a filmmaker trying things out, failing, and trying againThe brilliance of Southland Tales is inextricable from its flaws, if indeed they are flaws.This is not just another hodgepodge of a movie that's all noise and excess; writer/ director Richard Kelly has a point here; he has plenty to say.It's the sort of experience you feel embarrassed about even though you had nothing to do with it, because it's not just a mess, it's a pretentious messThey've left it late, but writer-director Richard Kelly (Donnie Darko) and his team have gone and scooped The Independent's Worst Film of 2007 award - against stiff competition, too.I hope Kelly's career survives Southland Tales, unless, that is, he plans to make more movies like this.A subversive and annihilistic satire on America, lurching from black comedy to farce, from dramatic insight to superficial jokesSets up such a pretense of intellectualism it fools its audience into believing it's on a plane they can't understand...While Donnie Darko is a fine film regardless of your level of sobriety, Richard Kelly's sophomore effort most definitely is not.When it's not being obstinately stupid, Southland Tales is just difficult to watch.I'll give it this: Southland Tales is never boring.The type of incoherent, indulgent muddle that can only emerge from the mind of someone who is quite talented.Although it's by any reasonable means a flawed film, Southland Tales demands watching, if only for its cinematic achievements.entirely misdirected, and the film never gels or even makes senseThe plot revolves around a film-within-a-film gimmick that, like the rest of the film, comes off only half-baked.Southland Tales is one of the smartest, funniest, most audacious -- and most mournful -- films of the year.Compared to the seemingly unsalvageable disaster Kelly screened at Cannes, this overcooked folly is a miraculous, Frankensteinian resurrection. Maybe this is grading on a curve, but I'd always rather have an excess of ambition than the opposite.Messier than a 2-year-old in a pool of pudding.Kelly seems to think that to merely mention Fallujah or global warming -- or to name a bank after Karl Rove -- is the same as actually having an opinion about them.It's enough to make you hope that a full-blown musical is in Kelly's future.There's enough happening here to fuel an entire TV series, with melodramatic excesses, wild mood swings and sitcom-style slapstick.Somewhere beneath all the layers of idiocy are some good ideas -- if only Kelly knew how to express them.With boundless ambition far exceeding his ability to tell a coherent story, Kelly manages only an artistic apocalypse....the lowest movie of the last nine years. There's political satire ostensibly buried somewhere in Kelly's muddy cinematic slop, but you'll never be able to stain it out. Blech!Southland Tales is a monumentally bad film, a landmark in 21st century cinematic awfulness. There's no real meaning to be found here; it's all signifiers for half baked ideas that Richard Kelly never managed to turn into anything worthwhile.it's a cautionary tale about the inevitable endgame of tasteless, artless, \"alternative\" culture.As the plot becomes more convoluted and the movie goes haywire, what saves it are its sardonic details.Every time [writer-director Richard] Kelly manages to build up a halfway decent head of comic froth...he blows it with some god-awful portent or \"statement.\"Southland Tales contains stuff as uproariously out-there as anything in Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove and as unnervingly subversive as Frankenheimer's The Manchurian Candidate.Reminiscent of the fiction of Kurt Vonnegut, with its mix of sci-fi mythology, absurdist humor and political outrage.The very incoherence of Southland Tales is something like an argument, its many pieces and pronouncements a deconstructive challenge to world order.Incoherent bluster that's meant to be as much a satirical take on the post-9/11 world as Dr. Strangelove was on the Cold War era, but fails miserably in every respect.Southland Tales is a funny, audacious, messy and feverishly inspired look at America and its discontents.Spending $12 and 2 1/2 hours (30 minutes less than the Cannes cut) on something as aggressively bad as Southland Tales is not something I can recommend with a clear conscience.The movie's failure to come together -- indeed to make sense for most of its 144 minutes, each one passing with the speed of molasses -- is a major disappointment.There's barely a trace of substance to Kelly's fiasco, nor anything like a so-bad-it's-good vibe.A rambling and incoherent vision of the near future, Southland Tales proves a major disappointment from the talented Richard Kelly.Consequently, I can recommend it to 'enhanced interrogation' practitioners who are tired of waterboarding.You can't be both political and incoherent.Even if the world Kelly's concocted always seems screamingly incoherent, you have to hand it to him. He's made a movie of our messy times that's too ambitious to settle for merely capturing the mess. It actually is the mess.Immature, crude, poorly made and a waste of time.No amount of reworking could salvage what was a misbegotten and unfunny idea to begin with.A Schwarzeneggerian actor, related to a political dynasty, has been kidnapped, replaced with a double, and -- I give up. A plot synopsis would require that the movie have a plot.Fun graphics, beautiful photography and great special effects will not save this tedious and self-absorbed epic from a direct trip to the DVD bin. The horse is beaten to death and even the bottled energy can't bring it back.There's too much sizzle and not enough steak.Southland Tales finally emerges as an admirably bold dud. Trying to sum up EVERYTHING that's wrong in the world in one kaleidoscopic go, it's messy, misshapen and curiously muffled. Seems the world does end with a whimper after all.By the climax, his truly ambitious, truly flawed film finally disappears into the 'time-space rift' (or whatever) to achieve some sort of cosmic transcendence.A bold and sometimes garbled take on modern American politics, this nevertheless marks an effective and surprisingly funny comeback for a film that many deemed to be DOA.Frustrating and finally rather pointless.Whether this is a demented B-movie or a comment on demented B-movies is hard to say. It is horribly fascinating, if not for the full 150 minutes.The film has a dated feel - it has more in common with 1960s-style wacky satire than the cutting edge of 21st-century cinema.A hypnotic disaster that's truly fascinating - if only for all the wrong reasons.No doubt some will dismiss it as an overlong, incoherent mess, but others (myself included) will emerge, bleary-eyed and brain-battered, just wanting to see the whole thing all over again.If Mulholland Drive had a prettier, younger, and developmentally-challenged sister, it would be Southland Tales.Kelly has unquestionably given us a bold and challenging work that is alive and kicking in every frame.Southland Tales resembles nothing less than a vintage Godard, with a brainstorm full of ideas roiling and lurching and looking for purchase.There's more. Much more, all of it absurd and confusing. That isn't necessarily meant as a complaint.Writer/director Richard Kelly misses the mark with this bubbling stew of images and ideas that never quite congeals into a viable film.Southland Tales delivers equal parts overwrought tedium and mind-bending beauty, spiked with brilliant throwaway images that more than make up for Kelly's heavy-handed hot-button pretensions.A few scenes work, but many more don't. Southland Tales may be one feature film that will play better in bits and pieces on the Internet.Dizzyingly incoherent and subversively surreal, this sophomore effort from the man who made the great, strange Donnie Darko is certain to have its fans. I'm not going to be one of them.Apocalyptic thriller is too apoplectic for most.We're plunked down in the middle of an apocalyptic mess. This time the mess is not so much addressed as embodied by the film itself -- but damned if it doesn't roll around in your head a while.Southland may be ambitious in its genre-defying abandon, sideswiping science fiction, satire, film noir and melodrama along the way, but it's also exasperatingly convoluted, self-amused and politically sophomoric.",

It was a sound investment.They don't make movies like Lady and the Tramp any more. I know that's a cliche, but it's true.The vintage animation is brilliant, and Disney has done a wonderful job with the transfer to DVD.While it's not one of the strongest Disney animated features, this one has enough strengths to keep it popular decades after its 1955 release.I just love hand drawn animation, it really brings to life all the characters in a very expressive way. The imperfections doing it by hand give everything a rougher edge but more heart.This tale (oh hah hah!) of two canines in love has withstood the test of time to remain a family classic.in many ways it is closer to the man Walt Disney's view of the world than any of his preceding films, especially the way it is filtered largely through his sense of nostalgia for the Victorian eraHandsomely, seductively drawn, Lady and the Tramp owns its place in the canon...Share the love of \"Lady and the Tramp\" with your loved ones this Valentine's Day.A somewhat dry, but very good Disney animated effort punctuated by a few Disney-defining classic moments.Classic Disney dogs paw their way into hearts.A wonderful blend of timeless romance, wholesome adventure, and breathtaking animation.Walt Disney has for so long parlayed gooey sentiment and stark horror into profitable cartoons that most moviegoers are apt to be more surprised than disappointed to discover that the combination somehow does not work this time.Easily the most beautifully-animated piece to come out of the Disney Studios since the Golden Age ended.Visual images on a 70mm screen are bound to be stunning, but it takes a fun and good-natured story to back them up; here, we have a premise that joins two opposites in a sweet love story as adventurous as it is fearsome and daring.With cracking music, a rollicking pace and dialogue that stands up to scrutiny, Lady and the Tramp really is among Walt's very best.The 50th Anniversary DVD release of Lady and the Tramp shows you everything that is right and wrong with Disney in one DVD package.Parents used to having their kids explain films to them will have their hands full on this one.Technically, Disney has created nothing finer.Charming and nostalgic.Not only is Lady and the Tramp one of Disney's sweetest films, it's one of their loveliest to look at.True Disney classic animation with great score.Classic Disney animation, classic story.

The best in the series so far.Easily the best film of the franchise so far, thanks to a witty script, colourful new characters, lively animation, inspired direction and some impressive 3D work, not to mention some exceptional comic timing.It's good to see that with a decent, fast-paced plot and some witty lines, the quality and entertainment value of the films has been maintained.You don't have to be a child of four to enjoy this series, but it helps.\"The best of the Madagascar films\" might not be the most ringing endorsement ever committed to newsprint, but DreamWorks Animation has finally found the franchise's groove in this pyrotechnic third instalment.It's a riotous circus you'd happily run away to.This is that rare thing: a franchise that grows more winning with each instalment.The eye-popping, energetic \"Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted\" really is a three-ring circus.Despite a script co-written by Noah Baumbach, \"Madagascar 3\" can't upgrade its own shtick, becoming a craven example of a fast-buck, no-fun family film.Your brain goes breathless and giddy struggling to keep up.If you typically check the ingredients on the stuff you feed your kids, here is what you'll find in \"Madagascar 3\": jokes, Katy Perry music and less than 2 percent of character development and emotional warmth.Cascading, colorful 3-D performance sequences are sufficiently dazzling that you'll forgive the bajillionth soundtrack sampling of \"Firework.\"Is there any reason to seek it out if you don't have kids to bring along or a desire to see every animated movie ever made? Not really.An over-the-big-top picture that will probably please toddlers and franchise fans but suggests that the series has pretty much run its course.My favorite of the \"Madagascars.\"I have to give props to a movie that ascends from eccentricity to insanity without losing its footing.This is a movie that's constantly in motion, with slapstick flair.A neon-saturated, high-flying trapeze act with enough frenetic funny business that it's a wonder the folks behind this zillion-dollar franchise about zoo critters on the lam didn't send the animals to the circus sooner.\"Madagascar 3\" is all about exuberant motion, cute characters and gorgeous colors. It aims for the eyes, not the heart.Grand family entertainment with substantial laughs and a thoughtful use of 3D...has genuine spark, keeping the adventure speeding along while massaging the digestible plot.A riot of splashy colors, silly 3-D gimmicks, big, broad kid-friendly gags - and those professionally pesky penguins.America, after all, becomes the Emerald City again in this movie's eyes, and the promise westward holds fresh allure. That's good enough for me.Set at a frenzied pace meant to connote fun, it mostly feels like a frenetic spectacle.\"Madagascar 3\u2033 is the best of the series, bright, fresh, fun, and funny, with a terrific script co-written by \"The Squid and the Whale's\" Noah Baumbach.Kids will be stimulated. And, parents, you'll enjoy the sights.Shot in 3D, it uses the medium to its best advantage and the circus theme allows the animators to go wild with color. But \"3's\" best assets are its new characters.The franchise that began as a tame kiddie pleaser about four pampered zoo animals lost in the wild has matured and sharpened its teeth, perhaps thanks to Noah Baumbach...One-ups its forgettable predecessors by actually being pretty good.A funny, snappy script and thrilling action sequences make this European adventure a trip worth taking.The clever lines and themes of friendship and finding home are almost completely overwhelmed here by the breathless pace and sensory overload...What might be barely tolerable in a seven-minute short gave me the biggest headache since \"Transformers: Dark of the Moon.''[It] may be the best of the bunch, simply because it busts the leash that tethers it to anything resembling reality.This latest offering is better than the first two and is a rare example of a franchise that keeps improving as it goes. (Full Content Review for Parents also available)If you want to see a family film that tries to make kids laugh by throwing lots of loud scenes with obnoxious characters doing annoying things and features the latest crappy pop songs, then MADAGASCAR 3 is for you.One of those rare movies that's magical for the entire family.A culture change is clearly taking place at DreamWorks Animation. Hallelujah.Exhausting, but still funny; with actual jokes meant for viewers over eight. It's not top-shelf booze, but irreverence wins out.A bright and breezy jaunt through Europe that delivers enough laughs, action and thrillingly staged adventure to keep the young ones happy.This is the rare animated property that has consistently improved on its ho-hum origins.Yes, it's a cartoon, but it's conspicuously unmodulated, with the volume set on high and the pacing all but pushed to fast-forward.This movie is so funny and sweet that it's official: this series actually gets better with each installment.The kids loved it. The adults loved it. This means it's a sure thing if you're looking for a family movie outing. Go check it out in 3D and everyone should be happy.Fans of the original might react with more of an indifferent shrug to their latest travelogue.The first two Madagascar's were pretty boring and strictly for kids. With great 3D and a little more fun, adults you have permission to like this one.Entertaining \"threequel\" has some mild violence, innuendo.From time to time the improbable occurs: A sequel outdoes its original.If you're stuck with babysitting duties, you could do a lot worse than spend a zippy, silly and antic hour and a half with the continent-hopping animals in Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted.The film is grounded in the arcs of its beloved characters and presents some exciting new ones, fun settings, and funny dialogue.A fun and fast family entertainment.The screenplay, by Eric Darnell and Noah Baumbach, churns out the snappy witticisms with admirable creative gusto, but it whizzes along at such a frenetic pace that you'll probably miss half of them.Short and silly, it's frenetically paced and visually dazzling, filled with high-flying acrobatics.It's not a great film, but it'll do for a silly summer lark...Oh, and CIRCUS AFRO!As the gags play out to their climactic showdown, this seems a fitting end to the series.MADAGASCAR 3 offers humor and heart in most all of the right places...The wildly successful animated comedy series finally--and, to be frank, very unexpectedly--breaks from pleasantly watchable kid-friendly mediocrity to visually imaginative, consistently witty all-ages entertainment.... this one was rotten in 2005 and 2008, and by now it's really beginning to stink.With an impressive array of voice talent, Dreamworks has created something truly special.Contains more than enough adult humor to keep all of the parents (and critics) in the audience satisfied.The result is almost exactly as good as it needs to be - no better and no worse. Where the norm is grimly assembled factory line products, that counts as a success.Not only is it the best of the series so far, but it actually makes us look forward to the prospect of a Part Four.For now, it is a downright delight to sit back and watch the likes of the loony lemur king Julien do anything and everything to entertain you.Perhaps the spectacle overwhelms the characters at times but this is a fun addition to this particular series.Fast, fun and glowing with neon delight, this third effort in the franchise is enough to encourage kids to seek out their own animal sanctuary.A vivacious 3D kaleidoscope of colour, dazzle and show, this third in the franchise simply bursts with joie de vivre, goofy humour and innovative ideasMadagascar 3 works because it knows its strengths and hits them repeatedly by being loud, frantic and dazzling.Bright, colourful and fun.Genuinely funny and gleefully entertaining, its creators aren't afraid to throw everything they've got at the screen to see what sticks - and a lot of it does.Dreamworks have outdone themselves with the glorious 3D rendering in Madagascar 3, especially with the circus scenes, accompanied by the modern dance-pop soundtrack.Easily the best of the series.Better than its predecessor but worse than most other things.It has value only as a way to engage a very young viewer until his or her attention span expires.The story in Madagascar 3 is functional, but the antically civilized spirit is infectious.Deeply, engagingly weird.The combination of kid-friendly boingy action, annoyingly catchy musical numbers and cutesy, simplistic life lessons is never dull to the kindergarten-and-down crowd.The movie zooms along at a clip so quick, it sometimes overwhelms.The circus acts and the rehearsals, which are set to Katy Perry's \"Fireworks,\" make the greatest use of the movie's 3-D capacities.Eye candy so saccharine sweet it might send viewers into diabetic comas.It's silly, and it's lazy. And yet, again, it's pretty funny.It's a deluxe 3D journey that kids will love and many adults should hail as worth the detour.Marks the spot where a shrill and unfunny kid franchise made the leap into hilarious and engaging family entertainment.In one magnificent chase sequence, the filmmakers pay tribute to The Matrix, one of the moments that will endear this movie to the grownups in the audience.Colorful, bright and wickedly smart in spots, 'Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted' is an animated romp that will entertain adults and children, pop-culture fans and opera buffs in a wide swath of action and comedy.Color, frantic action, cute animals and a half-hatched theme about rekindling passion don't hit the target.Whether you have kids, will never have kids, have to take your nephews, your nieces, or some random kid, you're gonna be able to get though this movie. There is a lot of fun stuff in here for everyone.The movie is fast-moving enough to make you forget that it doesn't make a lick of sense.Refreshed and energized Madagascar offering non-stop entertainmentHilarious and wildly entertaining - the best in the series. Bring on number fourIf you can't make a decent movie through normal means, relying on non-stop distractions to keep the thing humming along isn't the worst plan B.[W]e can only hope that this series of mediocrities, which has already spanned three continents, spares us the other four.Is vomit ever a good thing? 'Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted' is cinematic vomit, and that's a compliment.The film has a message worth grasping; sometimes it takes a departure from your comfort zone to truly understand what you have in life and what's important to you.A crowd-pleaser, and one that is better than it really has any right to be.The ghost of Tex Avery is alive and well in a frenetic sequel that does more than reheat and serve. Madagascar 4? Don't bet against it.Madagascar's animals parody human characteristics to enjoyably madcap effect.It has a little something for everyone, from kids to adults, probably too much slapstick and chasing around, but a mature element as well that makes it worth watching.While it may blunder down the odd comedy cul-de-sac, Madagascar 3 is often inspired and very, very funny.This overlong Saturday morning cartoon boasts plenty animals but little magic.This typically frenetic but wearying series entry lacks the Looney Tunes efficiency of its predecessors.In what could have been an extreme reaction to a paranoid fear of going stale, the film's directing triad - Tom McGrath, Eric Darnell and Conrad Vernon - have dialled up the crazy big-time; the pace of Mad3 is relentless.Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted is no better or worse than the earlier films. It's been forged from the same mould and features the same brand of humour.In the third movie the Madagascar gang joins a circus, and while the result isn't the greatest show on Earth, it certainly is a lot of fun... packed with silliness and festooned with 3-D effects worth the surcharge for a change.A riot of splashy colors, silly 3-D gimmicks, big, broad kid-friendly gags - and those professionally pesky penguins.The animation is grand, and the lovely images may be enough to send really young kids away happy. Their parents might leave feeling they've been taken in by some carny sleight-of-hand, though.Madagscar 3 is less interested in plucking the last bit of meat off the series's bones than with simply picking the lowest-hanging fruit.Like a big-screen Big Gulp, this third installment of the billion-dollar animated franchise contains as much cinematic confection as an 85-minute movie can bear.Powered by the impossible, high-flying stunts of its animal and human characters, Madagascar 3 spirals, sashays, pirouettes across the European continent....off-kilter wit and smarts to an animated bestiary that keeps you laughing while eloquently re-defining where home is.The level of visual and narrative sophistication on display is astonishing.Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted is a most welcome addition to summer and a great addition to a moneymaking franchise that seems as good as new.Third chapter (and first in 3D) in the popular franchise benefits from fast pacing, bright colors, dazzling circus acts, vigorous villain, and some new charcaters.Fans of the original and its familial sequel will love this colorful, vibrant excursion through Europe.For a frantic, action-packed 80-odd minutes, it seldom puts a foot, paw or cloven hoof wrong.Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted may arrive with low expectations, but it's a pleasant surprise, sending its character barrelling across continents for a zippy, engaging 90-minute adventure.A sugar high that inevitably fades with time.Sheer manic animated anarchy... It's as if the cool, smooth nonsense of the penguins' outrageous schemes -- yes, they're back too -- were allowed to take over the entire film...The first-class 3D animation is better than the cliche-ridden script.Instead of developing the characters or situations for comedy gold, the filmmakers instead just crank up the chaos. So while some scenes are both funny and visually impressive, this second sequel is simply too inane.Hugely entertaining, ferociously funny.This is animation that never just goes through the motions but glories in its feats and so, almost certainly, will you.It may lack a little in charm and warmth, but the technical brilliance and decent use of 3D go some way towards compensating for the dimensions that the film otherwise lacks.",

        "document": "Set a standard for CG-beasties that remained unmatche for many years, and still stands as one of the best of its kindGreat effects, a dime's worth of headache-inducing story.The plot is equal parts Westworld and (believe it or not) Jaws 3-D.Fads may come and go, but dinosaurs will always be cool... a fact for which Jurassic Park should be eternally grateful.May be one-dimensional and even clunky in story and characterization, but definitely delivers where it counts, in excitement, suspense and the stupendous realization of giant reptiles.True, the dialogue and performances are feeble, but the thing is basically no more -- and no less -- than a nifty monster movie that delivers crackerjack thrills.You want great dinosaurs, you got great dinosaurs.In the end, Jurassic Park succeeds because it's good entertainment.Jurassic Park does for live-action critters what Who Framed Roger Rabbit did for toons. In that sense, it's a cinematic landmark, but in terms of plot and character, it's about as well developed as Godzilla.This is Jaws with huge, scaly ridges. At times, it's more frightening.A classic gets even better.Still proves as thrilling as ever.Jurassic Park is an astonishing success in one sense and one sense only: It is the monster of all monster movies, guaranteed to challenge weak bladders, flutter heartbeats and win automatic Oscars for the [tech crew].Despite the presence of all this acting talent, it is the film's special effects, especially the work of \"dinosaur supervisor\" Phil Tippett, that carry the day.Jurassic Park is a masterpiece!Spielberg is less assured in the department of character development and some of the actors give worse performances than the computer-generated creatures, but, with a landmark spectacle like this, who cares?Some things have dated - Sam Jackson wouldn't be allowed to smoke in the office; everyone would have mobiles; Google Earth would have kept the island from being kept a secret - but the power of the film's pioneering CGI remain strangely undiminished.The 3D doesn't add a lot to the narrative, but it's still an exciting adventure into the mesmerizing world of dinosaurs and humanity's godlike addiction to reviving the past.Jurassic Park is a how-to guide for structuring a multi-character disaster film.Steven Spielberg's summer adventure is still one of the ultimate movie roller coaster rides.A strong candidate for Steven Spielberg's best film...Jurassic Park remains an incredible experience - one that never ceases to be entertaining. It's not an entirely faithful adaptation of Michael Crichton's popular novel, but the creative liberties it takes prove enormously ingenious.This is as close as any of us is likely to get to witnessing life in prehistoric times.The characters aren't much more well-defined than the anonymous victims of a teen horror movie... The dinosaur effects, however, are absolutely stunning, and sometimes so natural that one even forgets to be impressed.No matter how old or cynical I get, part of me will always be that same 12-year-old boy, sat in rapture, watching dinosaurs rule the world.Spielberg's sci-fic adventure, his most commercially successful film to date, is defined by never before seen special and visual effects.Jurassic Park, like the director's other work, is a technical marvel. The effects are great, and the movie's new digital sound system (choose your theater carefully) creates the sensation that giant reptiles are breathing in your ear.The earthshaking footfalls of these lizard-kings are palpable and terrifying. Spielberg's crew of dinosaur-effects artists has conjured up a Mesozoic menagerie whose realism outdoes anything in cinema history.A brilliant and dynamic piece of popular movie making, Jurassic Park has a lot more bite than bark.A cautionary tale about scientists and schemers messing with Mother Nature, the film makes its point. But it takes at least 30 minutes to get going.Spielberg's peerless twin gift has always been for making the fantastic seem real (Close Encounters, E.T., the Indiana Jones trilogy) and the real fantastic (Jaws).Steven Spielberg's Jurassic Park first introduced me to what movie magic can be.Jurassic Park has secured its spot as one of Spielberg's better effects driven films and still looks great a little over 20 years after its release.As an action film, as an auteurist vision, as a blockbuster, as a humanist statement...it's a masterpiece.Terrifyingly realistic dinos run amok in sci-fi landmark.Performances are top notch, the score is brilliant, and the special effects still hold up in what is easily one of Steven Spielberg's supreme masterpieces...One of the big screen's very greatest thrill-rides.As one of Spielberg's purest suspense rides, it's gimmicky, giddy, and still great value.Steven Spielberg's dino-park thrill ride comes up eye-wateringly shiny in this rereleased version - even if its clunkier elements have become a bit more obvious with time.It's not exactly brilliantly acted, except by the dinosaurs and raptors - there wasn't time for the usual number of takes.The effects have barely aged and the joy is timeless. Take a child who's never seen it and watch their imagination expand before your eyes.A thrill ride worthy of a real-life amusement park.I loved every fascinating, suspenseful, frightening, skilfully calibrated minute of it.Spielberg was wise to not rely entirely on computer images, rather blending the new technology with old-fashioned practical designs and the result is a film that looks far better than any modern tentpole blockbuster.A very welcome memo to Hollywood that blockbusters don't have to be stupid.Jurassic Park is the most self-reflexive blockbuster ever made ...This Steven Spielberg thriller remains one of his best films and one of the best summer blockbusters of all time.We ask for two things from big-budget thrillers like this: Make us believe and make us jump. Jurassic Park delivers on both counts.The effects hold up 20-plus years later. So do the thrills. Yes, 'Jurassic World' has its work cut out for it.As much as you can point to the T-rex attack as a master class in action filmmaking, this still leaves a mechanized aftertaste.The 3-D process adds not just dimension but depth - a technological extension of cinematographer Gregg Toland's deep-focus innovations in The Grapes of Wrath and Citizen Kane. The change in perspective creates greater intensity.Only time can tell which movies become classics. No matter how many Ds you see it in, it's safe to say that this one has earned the label.This is an immensely entertaining film, as long as you can overlook the many minor flaws that permeate its structure. (Complete Content Details for Parents also available)But really, what makes \"Jurassic Park\" great is that it is a Steven-Spielberg-master-class in constructing action set-pieces.\"Jurassic Park\" remains an absolute thrill from a Spielberg in top form: Funny, scary, fast-moving and full of just-right details.Jurassic Park in IMAX 3D may sound good on paper, but it is even better in actuality, a ridiculously fun re-release of one of American cinema's most wildly entertaining films.I'm a fan of this movie. It is thrilling, and the 3-D treatment is a nice enhancement.This movie doesn't just stand the test of time, it transcends it.\"Jurassic Park\" is such an impressive technical achievement that it seems churlish to note that it accomplishes this at the expense of more substantive elements.\"Jurassic Park\" was impressive in 1993. Twenty years later, it's flawless.The film is a classic and the chance to see it on the big screen again (or for the first time) should not be missedSentiment is explained by science as the family impulse that motivates so many Steven Spielberg stories is revealed to be an evolutionary imperative in this near-perfect action-adventure.[Looks] better not only than effects-driven movies of the same period, but better, frankly, than half of what gets released nowadays.Kids who love dinosaurs will love it. And who doesn't?confirms both Spielberg's mastery of cinematic thrills and the comparatively empty bombast of today's summer tentpole movies, even the better ones.Jurassic Park shows us a director in transition, and the film captures his transformation in its own kind of cinematic amber.[The] 3D [conversion] provides the definitive version of this classic film. Jurassic Park has been transformed with with artistry, nuance and sophistication, and it's an absolute must-see during this brief run.The 3D effects had me nearly jumping out of my seat. Some say Hollywood is converting too many old films to 3D. But, \"Jurassic Park\" was the perfect choice. There's nothing more fun than sharing a seat with a snapping dinosaur.Spielberg treats us as he does his characters, leading us into a strange land and expecting us to make it out with all our faculties intact; it's a tall order, given the heart-stopping, bloodcurdling, limbs-numbing excitement packed into the second hour.It is as if time has passed the movie by. \"Jurassic Park\" remains solid entertainment, but the awe and wonder have faded.Steven Spielberg has tapped into the mother lode of human dreams and sense of wonder....short on logic and certainly short on plot, but long on thrills and amazement.The problem with the film, plain and simple, is that it focuses all of its energies on the dinosaurs themselves.A little old-fashioned, now. But Jeff Goldblum in 3D? Enough said.That T. rex is worth the wait, but the wait itself is even more memorable.For all the ingenuity of the movie's engineering, Jurassic Park doesn't have the imagination -- or the courage -- to take us any place we haven't been a thousand times before. It's just a creature feature on amphetamines.Now a 20-year-old antique slapped with a superfluous 3D transfer, Jurassic Park still has the power to amaze.Spielberg has gone on to weightier and more prestigious projects, but this thrill ride is one of his best and a masterpiece of the genre.Have you always wanted to watch Jurassic Park through Ian Malcolm's sunglasses? Then boy, is Jurassic Park 3D for you.A film that managed to terrify a generation of children one minute, leave them eager to hunt for fossils in their backyard the next.Just as extraordinary as always ... even diamonds get a periodic polish.Do the dinosaurs work? Indeed they do. Does anything else? Not really.As pure spectacle, Jurassic Park works as well as anything else Hollywood's high-tech wizards have given us latelyJurassic Park 3D is like being reunited with an old friend; an old friend that wants to eat you and maul you to death, but still. A classic is reborn in glorious IMAX with a vibrantly stunning use of 3D.While it's not the most profound of Spielberg's works or the most entertaining from a popcorn perspective, it's one of the most technically flawless movies he's ever produced.The 3D isn't pushed on the audience, but it does reveal the amount of depth that Spielberg actually put into the film 20 years ago.The thrill of seeing live dinosaurs on screen is not as acute today as it was 20 years ago admittedly, but there is still some 3D awe left in the creations that roared 65 billion years ago...The enthralling man-vs.-nature parable based on the late Michael Crichton's best-selling novel hasn't aged one bit.A beast of a movie is gifted a superfluous-but-superb rouging of the cheeks, offering fanatics something new to study while newcomers will be ruined for any future television airings.The 3D conversion ruins everything, like the comet that killed the dinosaurs, making Jurassic Park the rare amusement I'd prefer to revisit at home.If releasing the film in 3-D is the only way to get it back in theaters, then the gimmick is an acceptable addition. The 3-D is good. But when a movie is this near flawless, nothing is needed to make it better.There is nothing like experiencing this fabulous, larger-than-life, groundbreaking movie where it was meant to be experienced. And in 3D!The tasteful Jurassic Park 3D conversion injects new wonder and excitement into one of the most captivating adventure movies ever made.Worthy, even though its a simplistic monster movie at heart.The excitement of Jurassic Park is in Spielberg's sense of timing, with the scene of the kids trapped in a jeep watching a cup of water tremble now a classic moment of cinema.Clich\u00e9 or no, there's no getting around it - quite simply one of the greatest blockbusters of all time.Jurassic Park earns its spot in fantasy-film history.The definitive dinosaur movie.Despite the ridiculous premise, Jurassic Park does an incredible job of showing us what dinosaurs might have looked and acted like.The biggest, grandest dinosaur movie ever.The roller coaster movie ride of the summer!Overall I give the movie a *** rating and wish the dinosaurs would have eaten all of the people except for say a narrator in the first 5 minutes of the show....is the movie worth all the hype? Partially yes, but mostly because of the special effects.The plot also conspires to harm the film's general credibility.Mr. Spielberg has great fun with every last growl and rumble signaling the approach of danger...You won't believe your eyes.An innovative, ingenious and spectacular sci-fi adventure. The special effects are truly dazzling.There's more soul to be found in any Kong close-up than in this film's overplayed reactions.Spielberg is still supreme as an action director, and when the T Rex makes beefburger of the jeep, or the vicious 'Raptors stalk their human prey, the film inspires wonder and awe.The well-selected cast is winningly sympathetic and entertainingly idiosyncratic.This is an exhilarating, sometimes terrifying monster of a movie that, once it gets you in its clutches, won't put you down again until the closing credits start to roll.This is the 2001: A Space Odyssey of dinosaur movies, one whose special effects render previous efforts obsolete.Spectacle triumphs over sense, but with effects this effective resistance is futile.",

        "document": "Timely subject matter and a compelling story ultimately win over uneven performances.A strong storyline about the West Bank and its endless cycle of violence leaves interpretation up to the viewer.By focusing on an everyman, Abu-Assad immediately makes Omar's claustrophobic lifetyle immediately relatable - which tinges his ultimate hardships with palpable dread.So this is what it's like to be a young Palestinian in the occupied West Bank.A stirring drama set in Palestine where an intense young man experiences the torment of distrust in his private and public life.Paradise Now and The Battle of Algiers explored why people under occupation resort to terrorism; Omar turns its attention to the broader, more long-term consequences of living in oppressed conditions.Palestine's official submission for the Best Foreign Language Oscar is terse, tense suspense drama, and less overtly political than you might expect.[Hany-Abu] Assad is getting better as a director, too. He handles scenes with a relatively light touch, and a foot chase has a certain action movie craft to it.Despite a conventional narrative arc and lulls in the rhythm, the film is a powerfully directed look at hopes and relationships ravaged by the world's most intractable conflict.\"Omar\" is a real thriller, a snake pit of plot twists, in which the perspectives shift, destinations change and the moral universe spins and sways.[U]ndeniably juicy packaging for what is, at its core, a good but not great crime dramaBakri, a relative newcomer to the big screen, does a superb job of carrying a film in which he appears in nearly every scene.A riveting blend of thriller and romance elements, \"Omar\" grabs you from the very first image.\"Omar\" does not offer the promise of a just or satisfying resolution, a fatalism all the more devastating given its realistic methods and humane, understated performances.Fresh take on thrillers and Romeos-and-Juliets set along the Israel/Palestine security wall. . . imbues a social consciousness in a mystery containing an intimate secret.A taut Palestinian thriller with romantic overtones that finds itself as a finalist for the Best Foreign Film Academy AwardAbu-Assad's film, about informants and duplicity in the Palestinian territory, is a must-see for those who value the cinema of commitment.Bakri has charisma to burn, but the complexity of Abu-Assad's previous movies is traded in for weak genre thrills.The strongest element here is the surprise-filled plot, and a standout performance from Palestinian-American actor Waleed Zuaiter.All the actors have an easy confidence that's vital for their frequent closeups, underscoring their humanity rather than their function as illustrations of a well-known conflict.With a cast consisting almost entirely of young, new, inexperienced talents, Abu Assad delivers an effective, credible, drama.The movie grips us partly because Bakri's performance is alternately casual and calculated.The virtues of \"Omar,\" a thriller about the Palestinian conflict, are overshadowed by a one-sided political message.A shell game of betrayal and counter-betrayal set in the worlds of police informing and sectarian score-settling on either side of the Israel-Palestine divide.Abu-Assad brings raw, human emotions into the situation, adding a poignancy to this engrossing piece of cinema.A well done, captivating thriller.Abu-Assad cares about his characters and their wretched but thrilling situations.This gripping Palestinian thriller evokes Gillo Pontecorvo's The Battle of Algiers in its depiction of not only the psychological pressures faced by people under occupation, but the murky moral consequences of retaliating.It's told with a stark, pitiless clarity that leaves you with fewer answers than before.Hard-hitting moments abound amid the slightly tangled plotting.The same story could have been set in any period, but set in an urgent contemporary world this is alive to the major moral conundrums contained in the everyday.The somber Omar isn't as controversial as Paradise Now but it too gets behind the TV news bulletins to discreetly put a human face on what is often just more electronic noise. Sometimes it's the quietest voices that are really the loudest.A masterful filmmaker, Abu-Assad choreographs heart-pounding Bourne-esque chase scenes ... while deftly marking the passage of time.Omar is romance and thriller. Of course, trust is at the heart of the matter.We take Omar's fate to be sealed from the moment he first meets his soft-voiced, salt-and-pepper-bearded, Mandy-Patinkin-on-Homeland-looking interrogator.A deft blending of thriller and romance, \"Omar\" invokes everything from film noir to Shakespeare.While one might certainly debate how persuasive the non-fictional implications of the story are, it's difficult not to be moved by the fictional narrative that leads to them.[Its] thriller machinations are merely a vehicle to deliver narrow-minded political preaching.The film works best as a straightforward melodrama set in an anything but straightforward world.Turns a story of resisting military occupation into a politically one-sided, contrived reminder about the risks of irresponsible love triangles.Watching someone learn to loathe is heartbreaking because it damns us all with a collective desire for revenge....a razor-sharp thriller.Abu-Assad does a masterful job of showing, in these seemingly hopeless circumstances, the fragility of life.Has all the electricity of a Jason Bourne movie but the truth of the Palestinian people suffering under a brutal occupation. Not to be missed.Beautifully shot, complicated, smart, and undeniably intense ... well-deserving of its place as the Palestinian nominee for this year's Best Foreign Language Film.Doesn't provide easy answers as it builds its pressure cooker environment, putting primary attention on the personalities involved, allowing for a human perspective as it details acts of breathless survival and suffocating paranoia.From button-pushing Palestinian writer/director Hany Abu-Assad, who gave us the inflammatory Paradise Now in 2005, comes an equally piercing, if less politically strident look at life under Israeli occupation.Bakri gives a richly detailed performance, often allowing his stoicism to slip and reveal the confused and angry young man within.Abu-Assad does not aim for the Dardennes' breathless immediacy. Rather, the story is laid out in a lucid, diagrammatic way, like a mathematical proof that for someone in Omar's position there are no right choices.This is a subtle political film: one that fully dramatises a situation and lets us think out its contradictions for ourselves.Abu-Assad is simply reflecting the ever-changing nature of his characters' daily lives in a fraught and strange environment in which betrayal has become endemic.As in his Golden Globe-winning 2005 drama Paradise Now, Israeli filmmaker Hany Abu-Assad takes a complex, personal approach to a touchy political-religious situation in this Palestinian love story.The end result is a nerve-rattling entertainment flavoured by vigorous, deeply felt polemic.A tense, involving combination of love story and thriller.Abu-Assad creates vivid, relatable characters, but like \"Paradise Now,\" \"Omar\" is more about a place whose people are so beaten down they can't see any way out.The young cast making their film debuts keep us guessing as to just who's playing whom with the film itself playing like a more modestly scaled Occupied Territories version of \"Casablanca.\"Abu-Assad's tale is less a political thriller than it is a human story - although everything about its setting and circumstances is defined by oppression, surveillance, restriction, and control.A story of love and betrayal set against political tumult and violence in Palestine, \"Omar\" is both classic and painfully present in its concerns.A tender love story, a haunting tragedy and an expertly crafted thriller with flawed, damaged and not entirely likable characters.Helped along by an amazing cast of mostly first-time actors, \"Omar\" feels very fresh, due to its attitude, its approach, and the fact that it offers no solutions.Director Hany Abu-Assad's film is tense and often thrilling, creating complex political issues through complicated personal struggles.Writer-director Hany Abu-Assad is more interested in the ideas within his slow-burn thriller than in plot machinations.It's the sort of film that feels so authentic that even knowing it's a fiction, the morning after seeing it, I found myself scanning headlines to see if there were any new developments.Bakri has a simmering energy and stark humanity..This thriller is about more than the sum of its parts.Like most movies about the Middle East conflict, Omar is ultimately about the futility of violence and how it feeds on itself.It is difficult to figure out which is the film's more pressing theme - the power of love to change the course of a life, or the political and social realities of living in occupied territory.Abu-Assad captures the everyday reality of life in the West Bank and the psychological cost of living constantly in a state of powerless anxiety and desperation.What makes Omar a remarkable accomplishment is that it also works brilliantly as a genre piece, keeping its audience at the edge of their seats for most of the running time.A harrowing, humane Arabic-language import about life under occupation that's part Romeo-and-Juliet love story and part twisty chess-pawn thriller.\"Omar\" eventually becomes a sun-scorched neo-noir - and the fade-out is an unforgettable jolter....fares best in its opening half hour...I don't want to see the characters as freedom fighters or terrorists. I just want to see them as human beings. But the director uses them as political magnets to draw us toward his ideological sympathies.Abu-Assad offers no solutions here. Instead he paints a portrait of the daily rhythms of the occupation, an endless conflict that has seeped into every aspect of life in the West Bank....an affective piece of filmmaking and garners empathy for Omar. The fact that the helmer gets such solid performances from newcomers is, in itself, remarkable.The story dishes out action and surprises without losing its political intent.A fraught film ...A hopeless tangle in the West BankMulti-faceted, thought-provoking Palestinian film could have used more heart, less brainKnotty and tense for most of its running time, Omar becomes muddled in its closing minutes, conflating personal and political treachery.Abu-Assad has created a convincingly noirish hell that feeds on distrust and vengeance.As a thriller, Omar is quite on a par with the slickest action suspense film, and its twists and turns keep it compelling on a pure entertainment level.",

        "document": "Batkid Begins has the feel of a barn-raising gone global.The seams occasionally show, especially whenever the shy, overwhelmed Miles grows tired or reluctant - or whenever the easily defeated villains start to look like so many overstuffed dolls - but it's impossible to say \"no\" to this project.Nachman's documentary does a great job of showing the many pieces that came into place for Miles' moment, but it doesn't look much at what's underneath it all.The film will restore one's faith in humanity, at least during its running time.It's a rare documentary that showcases the absolute best of humanity.Plucky, upbeat and utterly lacking in cynicism -- much like the epic day this Make a Wish event went down.Nachman has structured her film to illustrate how coming together for a cause can be at least as, if not more beneficial for the adults who helped make a small boy's dream come true than for the kid himself.Batkid Begins uses its unforced sentiment and real emotional depth to (at least temporarily) slay any misanthropic feelings or cynical thoughts.Get ready to have your spirits lifted by Batkid Begins, the most heartwarming film you're going to see this year.There's a wealth of material to draw on, almost as if a documentary-to-be-named later was already on someone's mind. In any case, Nachman puts it all to good use, relaying the conception, planning, preparation and execution of the day.This is the kind stuff that you cannot make up.Though it's easy to contrast \"Batkid Begins\" with \"Dear Zachary\" - tears of heartache replaced with tears of joy - both are about coming out of tragedy with a positive outlook for the future & rewarding the often thankless task of being a great parent.If watching \"Batkid Begins\" doesn't move you, I seriously don't know what will. And who doesn't love a five-year-old superhero?For one day, at least, the optimists among us could revel in the good-heartedness of people the world over.As a record of the event it's amiable enough, but also a bit ragged and more than a little self-satisfied.Everybody got a bit of childhood back, not because of what they got but because of what they gave.Wholesome as heck, but with a sane and appealing message.Tremendously heartwarming, positive docu for all ages.Batkid Begins is almost better than Xanax. It's like swallowing a little yellow happy pill with the Bat signal on it.Entertaining and wonderfully satisfying.The year's most joyous and surprising movieAny hope of meaningful reflection or insight is doused by a steady drip of often redundant and banal observations.[A] humorous and touching new documentary.While it's far from stellar filmmaking, there's a winning positive tone to this misty-eyed documentary.Nachman, for her part, diligently tries not to lose sight of the child at the center of it all.It's refreshing to see a film that's completely lacking in cynicism.Unfortunately Batkid Begins is so rigidly upbeat that it begins to seem like one of those really cheesy Hallmark movies on TV.The deeper we go into Dana Nachman's unquestioning, feature-length cheerleading film, the more uncomfortable I felt about the reaction of one person to that magical and overwhelming day. Miles.Cynics can carp. Let them. But don't be one of them.With great cheer and good spirit, Batkid Begins tells a true story that will restore your faith in humanity.It tells the story in a powerful and uncomplicated way.If you have the opportunity to see Batkid, I encourage you to buy a ticket. It won't change our world. But it could change us. Then we can improve the world. Batman would like that.\"Begins\" journeys into the heart of charity and community support, clearing away the ugliness of the world for 80 minutes to bask in the glow of what was intended to be a block-wide event that eventually snowballed into a global phenomenon.There's plenty of space for cynicism in this bitter, cold world, but Batkid Begins makes a fine case for an authentically rare mass moment of everyone acting like a decent person.At some point ... we notice Batkid Begins is also a way to call attention to other parties, massive Silicon Valley corporations that jump on the Batkid bandwagon - including Apple, Twitter, Facebook and, most suspiciously, Uber ...Bring kleenex.It's great fun to watch, with even President Barack Obama getting in on the act, and Batman Begins can be enjoyed entirely on this basis.Celebrates a city united for fun and goodwill, and the rare, pronounced sense of play and energy adults are capable of rediscovering, as do those who toil excitedly and hopefully to give Miles 'a little bit of his childhood back.'\"Batkid\" is a feel-good film, in the sense that the people who made this wish come true seem to feel pretty good about themselves. They certainly have a right to be satisfied: What they pulled off is impressive.The footage is simultaneously spectacular and intimate, with plenty of adorable-child moments.... too often feels shallow and superficial, missing a chance to provide depth and context beyond the basics.Contagiously joyous.Batkid Begins is a story about good people doing better things, which makes everyone happy. Why is this something we keep forgetting?Sweet, heartwarming and uplifting....The film isn't really about young Miles (whose cancer is today in remission) but about all of us, about our bottomless capacity to do good and our shared love of little kids, big dreams, and Batman.The filmmakers lay on such a thick layer of schmaltz that you'll need a cape and cowl of your own for protection.Tears will be shed, many of them surely genuine. Yet there's still something about this oversize spectacle, and Miles' ultimate place in it, that gives nagging pause.A fascinating look at how a true event can become a media event - and how courting the media can have good and bad results so mixed up that it's hard to know where the good influence stops and the corrupting influence starts.Expands a two-minute viral video into a feature-length dry procedural of city permits, bitty bat costumes, street closures and savvy social promotionAs a perhaps accidental commentary on the ephemerality of Internet life, with events - even big ones, like the one captured here - coming into being then passing into oblivion, lost in the ever-towering haystack that is Google, it's fascinating.The editing is ruthlessly efficient, and some of the talking-heads scenes are dramatized via lively comic-book renditions that lend visual panache. All the characters grab you, not just the kid.It emphasizes just how much effort went into pulling the day together, and it's a fitting tribute to the volunteers who went above and beyond to bring a little boy's dream to life.This is not to diminish the incredible efforts put forth by many on that 2013 day. But if Batkid Begins is meant to chronicle those events, why does it seem so incurious about getting to the roots of how such a phenomenon occurred?\"Batkid Begins\" doesn't have answers for our many troubles, nor will it change the world, but it provides hope for humanity, and that's something we surely need to see more of right now.Almost all the talking heads are excited and proud, filling the film with a positive electricity. It's a power that most docs of such simplicity just don't have.Marveling without questioning, the movie is content to package the phenomenon and coast on its feel-good wave. Yet, somewhere around the midpoint, I began to wonder who was most thrilled by all this fuss.Who would have thought that the week after Inside Out opened, another movie about a kid in San Francisco would have me crying even more - and laughing almost as much?",

        "document": "What would happen if Ridley Scott directed Under the Tuscan Sun and replaced Diane Lane with Russell Crowe? You'd have A Good Year.Escapist dilettantes may find A Good Year light, breezy and charming but even the most rudimentary inspection will reveal the film's sickeningly rotten core.Don't expect to be beguiled by A Good Year. That would be like trying to warm your hands at an artificial fireplace.Even judged by the not excessively demanding standards of middle-aged renovation fantasies, A Good Year isn't much.It's an ambitious experiment, and not a completely successful one.A Good Year offers little return on your own $10 investment beyond the spectacle of Scott misplacing his talents.Definitely not vintage Crowe ... He can do a world of things as a leading man, but Cary Grant (or Tom Hanks) he's not.To quote a classic cinematic oenophile -- quaffable but far from transcendent.Completely vacuous. A Good Year isn't. It isn't even a good minute. It's a romantic comedy without any laughs or any chemistry.I'll write A Good Year off as nothing more than a bad harvest.Like spending two hours with someone who is tiresome but who thinks you should find him exceedingly charming.... a film with all the subtlety and bouquet of a screw-top bottle of wine purchased in the bargain bin of your local supermarket.Pays homage to classic European cinema without being overly pretentious or particularly deep.Scott tries to pump up this slender tale into something more meaningful: His tactic of choice is to bully us into always feeling something, which leads to an astonishing amount of clumsy comedy and overreaching sentiment.The humor is fast and witty - P.G. Wodehouse on rocket fuel.It's harmless. If by harmless you mean zombifying and cynical.Magically transports us to the sensuous setting of southern France where memory, love, and a grand fondness for place conspire to alter the life of a selfish London traderSlick and sweet but superficial and only occasionally intoxicating....an airy, pleasant diversion for those who like light entertainment, solidly constructed. Like a good table wine, it goes down easy.It doesn't matter that the storyline of Ridley Scott's A Good Year is different from that of its inspiration - Peter Mayle's book, A Year in Provence. But it does matter that the tone is flippant and that we don't fall in love with the central characterIt's no surprise that you can see A Good Year's plot twists and clunker of an ending from a mile away.In A Good Year, Crowe gets to make jokes and wisecracks that show off his boyishly mischievous comic timing.Plonk is a Britishism for cheap, low-quality wine -- not undrinkable, by any means, just nothing special. As much could be said for this film, lightly based on the helium-weight plonk of a best-seller by Peter Mayle.When did Russell Crowe morph into Jimmy Fallon? You practically can see Crowe screaming to the audience, 'Don't you like me? I really really want you to like me.'One could do worse than to please one's eyes with the pictures here, but that may be as far as any stimulation goes.As much respect I have for Crowe as a dramatic actor, the painful truth is, comedy just isn't his forte.It's light, airy, easygoing, idyllic and rather goofy.Russell Crowe may find himself discovering the simple joys of life in A Good Year, but audiences will be checking their watches during this joyless attempt at comedy.There isn't a milliliter of honest feeling from start to finish, and precious little comedy or romance.the scenery's about the only thing worth appreciating in this mediocre Year.A simple repast consisting of sometimes strained slapsticky comedy, a sweet romance and a life lesson learned.You sense in every frame the strain to be lighthearted.One suspects it was a lot more fun to make this movie than it is to watch it.Ridley Scott's obvious love affair with sunny and sensual Provence ultimately makes A Good Year worth watching.Movies with predictable arcs rise or fall on their cinematic moments. Fortunately, there are several in A Good Year.A Good Year is never less than visually ravishing, its warm, inviting vistas of the French countryside and its unhurried, pleasant vibe putting the viewer in the same frame of mind as Max.A Good Year may not be vintage stuff, but it goes down fairly smoothly.Like a fragile Provence wine left too long in the sun, Ridley Scott's romantic comedy A Good Year spoiled somewhere between the publication of Peter Mayle's novel and this cockamamie adaptation.Close your eyes. And now imagine the whole thing re-cast and shot by Stanley Donen back in, say, 1962, with Cary Grant and Leslie Caron.A Good Year, an innocuous, feel-good movie that reunites Russell Crowe with the director Ridley Scott, is a three-P movie: pleasant, pretty and predictable. One might add piddling.A Good Year builds so much fairy-tale contrivance with such boisterous high spirits that it's exhausting to keep feeling good about feeling good.A Good Year is a chance for Crowe and his Gladiator director Ridley Scott to slow down and appreciate the good things, like beautiful women, good wine and a country home in France.A Good Year is a bad movie.When I think of humor and lightness of touch, Scott is about the last director to leap to mind, and Crowe nearly the last actor.It's pleasant stuff, going down about as easy as a vintage merlot.Could be packaged alongside Under the Tuscan Sun and sold with matching, his-and-hers fluffy bathrobes....starts out as pleasantly predictable...but bogs down...A pleasant enough diversion if you can get past the 'Borat'-like embarrassment of slapstick moments.They were so adamant about not repeating [Gladiator's] themes that they borrowed a new one from Pixar's Cars.A Good Year is nothing to Crowe about.Ridley Scott's lush adaptation of Peter Mayle's novel about a ruthless London commodities trader who finds his soul in Provence is broad, hackneyed and stultifyingly predictable.Crowe, a superb dramatic actor, is congenitally incapable of humour, especially when he tries slapstick.The comedy A Good Year provides a good excuse for insisting that actors and directors are better off playing to their strong suits.Russell Crowe would appear to mix with light comedy about the same way oil mixes with water. Which is to say, not at all.A Good Year is the story of a jerk in an expensive suit who inherits a French chateau and, after a few transformative weeks under the Proven\u00e7al sun, becomes a jerk in a ratty bathrobe.Full of pretentious grape-droppings on how wine is like life, only tastier and with a bolder finish, A Good Year is at best elusive to the palate. At worst, it's a bad pressing of a vintage that has no reisling to exist.A shamelessly enjoyable retread, an ode to la belle vie that has been well turned on a factory spindle.A pleasant jaunt through one of the most beautiful places on the planet -- encased in a story that ends up making you feel that all is right with the world.It's an amiable picture, and witty in parts; but it never goes anywhere you don't expect it to, and after a while you may start to lose enthusiasm for going along with it.A Good Year feels as if it takes a year to watch, and not a very good year at that.an aggressively mellow comedy that shows off the bucolic beauty of Provence, extolls the virtues of country living and then bellows 'Relax -- right now!' at the viewer.Is it good for those Gladiator dudes Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe to team up again for a romantic comedy about winemaking in the South of France? Perhaps not, but it's a nice try.Crowe never connects with this character, and his internal journey from putz to prince never attains any emotional resonance.The overall effect is one of a sumptuously laid table where the main course is overcooked.Whatever joy Scott and his cohorts might have experienced on location didn't make its way into the movie. This Good Year is no good time.Intentions are good in A Good Year, but the sweat is too obvious on the brows of all involved.Awkward when delivering lighthearted dialogue, Crowe seems profoundly uncomfortable with physical comedy, approaching it with an intense earnestness that smothers potential chuckles.Despite all the sunny, Provencale charms, the plot is a wisp of wee gags, peeps of flesh, mildly charming repartee.Despite some stunning visuals and a lot of nice moments, the finished product feels like the work of an actor and director who are out of their element.On a rainy day, A Good Year may be welcome fantasy; the question is whether anyone will remember it after the clouds have parted.If this is A Good Year, please spare us a bad one.A Good Year is like a promising wine that's a bit new to the bottle. It goes down rough, but there's this marvelous aftertaste on the palate.It's corny and predictable and delightfully simplistic in its goal: to provide a couple of hours of fun. Mission accomplished.There are precious few surprises in A Good Year -- its story, like its garden paths, is well-trod and familiar.The lush glimmer of the scenery is so eye-catching that it's easy to sit back and experience A Good Year as a kind of tony travelogue.Scott and Crowe, who last worked together on Gladiator, should have stuck with the togas; Crowe runs the emotional gamut from bored to perplexed to just plain miserable in a romantic comedy that is neither romantic nor comic.Figuring out why director Ridley Scott and star Russell Crowe were happy as can be to make A Good Year is not difficult. What's harder to come up with are compelling reasons to see it.It's the first time [Crowe or Scott] has tried his hand at comedy; there's a lot of self-conscious talk about the importance of timing, but the tony sense of entitlement tends to dampen any laughs.There's a lazy quality to the movie. It's as if the filmmakers imagined themselves as taking a vacation while they were shooting it.This flat-as-last-night's-champagne comedy is yet another epiphanic tale about a hard-driving corporate workaholic who learns how to stop and smell the roses, or the grapevine fertilizer, as is the case here.If nothing else, A Good Year conveys why the people in Provence are sick to mort of tourists who show up to get sloppy on red wine and revel in the countryside's Cezanne gorgeousness.You've got to wonder if old pals Scott and Crowe had such a great time on the set, they simply forgot to channel any of that experience into the film itself.Crowe's as excellent a romantic lead as he is a gladiator, and A Good Year wouldn't be nearly as good without him.For those who don't mind pictures that fall into predictable rhythms, A Good Year represents a pleasant diversion.A guy version of a chick flick, and like regular chick flicks, it's pretty sappy stuff, though with the lovely locations and sumptuous cinematography, it's very pretty.Watching Russell Crowe attempt comedy ... is a bit like watching a dancing bear at the circus. He makes the right moves, but the rhythm is all off.Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe attempt light romantic comedy in A Good Year, and the results are as grindingly discordant as a punk band writing a suite of waltzes.Despite the failings of the script and the story, it was the ambience that made the film an enjoyable experience for me. ...(O)bserving life in Provence, lived by people like Russell Crowe and Abbie Cornish. What's wrong with that?Almost entirely siphons the magic out of [Mayle's Provence]This seemingly unassailable trifecta of director, actor and setting is as stale as a week-old baguette.It's ultimately a so-so movie that does little more than answer what should've been an ironic question: What would happen if Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe made a romantic comedy?A Good Year suggests not so much the stirring of a soul as Sir Ridley grinding his teeth behind the camera, grimly muttering \"I'm going to be breezy if it kills me, goddamit!\"Russell Crowe brings to bear his now-familiar acting tics in a not-so-tender romance by director Ridley Scott.Predictable but pleasant movie for teens and up.Under the Tuscan Sun for men[Russel Crowe's] supply of quips and pratfalls is inexhaustible, even when he's trapped at the bottom of a swimming pool surrounded by peat and dry leaves. Alas, he escapes.This Gallic tourist-porn feels as stale as yesterday's baguette.Crowe has located his funnybone again in a conventional but engaging romantic comedy ...It's so goddamned cute you almost want to puke, but you don't. This is the most charming movie of the year, and it comes within an inch of being too sweet to stand, but it doesn't get there.'Look Homeward, Gladiator' hints at new dimensions of warmth and heart in Russell Crowe and Ridley Scott. They're not there yet, but they're headed in the right direction.The course A Good Year takes feels like it's on rails: there's only one possible destination and only one way to get there.Does not translate into a good film.Where A Good Year is headed is obvious before the opening frame, but working from a warm script, Ridley Scott directs mostly genuine performances to keep us interestedAudiences will have to be content with the admittedly lovely Provence landscape and Ridley Scott's slick, superficial direction. Those searching for anything more will be sorely disappointed.With this minor romantic fable Scott enters into the turf of Hallstrom's yarns about Life's Big Lessons. The genders are reversed but culture collision premise and feel-good nature recall Under the Tuscan Sun with French Provense instead of Italy.Ridley Scott's sun-dappled tale of wine-making in the wilds of Provence slips down easily enough but leaves a nasty residue on the palate....it's hard not to feel a twinge of disappointment as the film quickly reveals itself to be an innocuous and ultimately forgettable piece of work.As the audience moves from feast to feast, watching all the screen characters grow, glow and have fun, we can't help but feel like we're the only ones at a party who aren't drinking.The tourist brochure photography and colourful supporting cast make up for a lot, but this never quite works because it's neither as funny or as charming as it thinks it is.the best way to sum up [Crowe] is shockingly lacking in anything resembling charm. There is not even a charismatic sort of anti-charm at work here.Scott is clearly aiming for cute and wacky while hedging his bets with sticky nostalgia.Any vacation which could dry out Russell Crowe's intensity is probably a good thing. Just not as a lark by his Gladiator director doing Benny Hill jokes while he discovers the joys of life.There are some pretty funny things in there.Russell Crowe has many talents, but a gift for light comedy is not one of them.Provence looks like a lovely place to visit and Mr. Scott deserves his rest now and then, but let's hope he gets back to darker work soon.You can do worse than seeing a movie with gorgeous scenery, a predictable plot and sweet characters.Russell Crowe trying to twinkle may not be the most unsettling thing on the big screen this season, but it's up there.Every Scott movie has worthwhile visual dazzle, but this is what happens when Hollywood giants lecture against the evils of wealth.Alternately, you could do your laundry, which would be just as exciting and possibly more dramatic.Scott's film is like a reproduction of things he's seen in romantic comedies over the years with no idea why they're there.They [director Ridley Scott and star Russell Crowe] may have had a good time making the film, but I can't say I did while watching it.A leaden attempt at an upbeat romp from the downcast, feel-bad tag team of actor Russell Crowe and director Ridley Scott, the movie is like hearing a knock-knock joke told by a mortician.",

        "document": "This enlightening and disturbing documentary offers a spell-binding view of how individual soldiers are reacting to their mission in Iraq.If you want to get a feel for what American soldiers really experience while serving in Iraq, this unassuming, fly-on-the-wall documentary is the place to go.Compelling viewing.Tucker's digital video portrait of life in Iraq is fascinating and unsettling.Does little to further the discussion on the war.A frank look at life on the ground in Iraq.The directors of this documentary about our troops in Baghdad tell us more about their own views than the soldiers' ...Offers viewers an extraordinarily revealing portrait of the soldiers' lives in Baghdad, and how they weather the stress of being under constant siege.A striking new documentary that shows the war in a way it's not been seen before: from the ground up.An intimate, nonpoliticized, uncensored and totally unappealing look at the lives of U.S. soldiers serving during a grim and uncertain period of insurgency.A deep, imbedded look at the complex realities of the situation in Iraq that's not seen on your local nightly news.Michael Tucker missed a golden opportunity to say something meaningful and important about the lives of the men and women of our Armed Forces.A valuable if understandably haphazard record of the American occupation of Iraq.A video diary about staying alive during an ill-defined, unconventionally dangerous tour of duty.A welcome antidote to the self-convinced rhetoric of pundits and politicians.Illuminating, disturbing, evenhanded.Gunner Palace's casually hectic verite style overflows with the feverish identification of the deeply, if fleetingly, embedded outsider.The vision of force, hardware, and a touch of bluster camouflaging a state of high anxiety is a perfect summation of the U.S. presence in Iraq.At times, the film's evocation of war's absurdities invokes memories of Robert Altman's M*A*S*H.Gunner Palace has a raw home video quality that's often quite beautiful. Much of the movie is hardly more than an immersion in sights and sounds.We all can't get to Baghdad to experience their current transition to a new Iraq, but Tucker's documentary remarkably helps put us into their situationShapeless but its objective stance is powerful.It doesn't seem like we have any good answers for them. But we could start by paying attention to their stories.The motive may be worthy, but chaos of events mirrored by chaos of technique does not make for a film.A doc about a unit of American soldiers in Baghdad that's filled with the irony of the troops.Tucker offers an honest and profound corrective to the deplorable dearth of coverage of what's happening on the ground in Iraq.Docu offers up its sounds and images bluntly, and they are very much sounds and images worth having as part of the record.A riveting and indispensable record of the war in Iraq because it comes from the men who lived it.They're young humans put in extraordinary circumstances and this documents some of their internal struggles.Showing a frank and unfiltered view of U.S. soldiers in Iraq, this distinctive documentary has an authenticity and impact far above the typical news report.Frank and fascinating, \"Gunner Palace\" brings the Iraqi War home, putting the dangerous and boring lives of U.S. soldiers into equally provocative perspective.The filmmakers strove to shock a society addicted to \"reality\" TV by forging through and actually showing them something actually real.A brief peek into a chaotic world but devoid of the context needed to appreciate these soldiers' sacrifice.The film, though sympathetic to the soldiers, is really an homage to the very worst in American culture.Tucker takes it all in without taking a stand, though his sympathies -- expressed through voiceover narration -- clearly lie with the men and women in the field.The filmmakers have created a thought-provoking documentary that is at times disturbing, uncomfortable, brutal, profane and amusing.You certainly can't question Tucker's bravery, but you may occasionally feel the urge to ask him to be quiet.You get a glimpse of what a tour of duty in Baghdad is really like.Gunner Palace is important because of its unique depiction of military service.Although this embedded view is revealing, watching the unformed footage becomes tedious.not quite as rogue as its filmmakers appear to think,Avoids political views and is instead a tribute to the John and Jane Smiths of the American military risking their lives for an ideal rather than a clear goal.Gunner Palace is not a great film, but it is a contentious one.As unalloyed a look at who our people are in the Iraqi theatre of war and how they're conducting themselves as anything recorded.A commendably apolitical visit to the soldiers in IraqMichael Tucker and Petra Epperlein know that now is the time to make sure people know what the Iraqi War looks like and hopefully they will.A rambling war documentary without a political agenda about U.S. soldiers of the 2/3 Field Artillery stationed in Iraq.A powerful film, going beyond the casualty statistics and minute-long news clips to provide a sense of what it must be like for the guys and girls over there.If you have friends or relatives who are serving in Iraq and you want to know what they are up to, this is the film for you.Esta vers\u0103o estendida (e entediante) de COPS se preocupa tanto em mostrar os soldados chocados por serem odiados que se esquece de comentar que eles nem deveriam estar ali.Lock 'n load as the flip-side of rock 'n roll, with literal battle raps that function as both painful autobiography and frontline reportage.Tucker and Epperlein are pushing no agenda other than respect and support for U.S. soldiers, and that alone is worth watching.While Gunner Palace has the immediacy of street rap, it is actually a throwback to the cinema verite style of pioneering documentarians D.A. Pennebaker, Albert Maysles and Frederick Wiseman.But they're very good at documenting the tedium of the place and the work, the banal dangers of an occupation where the enemy could be anyone.An important work by being the right film at the right time.Isn't a smooth piece of filmmaking, but the work of directors (Michael Tucker, Petra Epperlein) who simply want you to see what they saw.It's a fascinating, sometimes furious, sometimes funny film about the soldiers in one unit in Baghdad, videotaped from a fly-on-the-wall perspective.Impressive and intimate look at the realilty of the aftermath of the U.S. invasion of Iraq.First-time documentary makers (Michael) Tucker and ... Petra Epperlein ... get a little bogged down in letting soldiers express their feelings through amateur rap.... in post-Saddam Baghdad much depends on the snap decisions of 19-year-old Americans.The film's strength -- and its weakness -- is in its you-are-there view of guys who are e-mailing their loved ones back home one minute and breaking down the doors of Iraqi homes the next, on the hunt for the enemy.An oddly hollow experience.Gunner Palace succeeds as a series of snapshots of the post-war landscape ...Practically agenda-free, but a slice-of-life like this loses steam after about 45 minutes. At least a strident political viewpoint gives you something to talk about.The soldiers uncover no weapons of mass destruction at the wrecked palace, though they do find a putting green and a swimming pool.Compelling, fascinating stuff.It gives a palpable sense of the boredom, the danger, the tacit terror, the surrealism and the absurdity.Reminds you that the thousands of faceless, nameless troops in Iraq are still there after you switch off CNN.If you have conflicted feelings about the war in Iraq, prepare for them to be even more conflicted after the movie ends.There isn't much of a narrative arc to Gunner Palace, and that's sort of the point of this grunt's-eye view of Iraq.A doc that doesn't quite live up to its premise but still manages to go beyond packaged news and into the often surreal days and nights of soldiers in a strange, modern war.Jammed with information and serious testimony, giving a detailed and textured account of what it's like to be fighting the war more than a year after victory was declared.The American soldiers in the documentary Gunner Palace aren't strictly heroic liberators or jackbooted imperialists. They're neither and both, and that's what makes the movie interesting.Works purely as a series of complex snapshots of the conflict in Iraq.A bit disjointed but accomplishes its mission: to provide a glimpse into the soldiers' everyday lives without taking a side on the war.Goes inside the Baghdad war zone with the soldiers stationed at the title locale.The documentary succeeds [on some levels], but it seems to miss the boat with the narration and the way the movie is edited together.A fascinating look into the everyday existence of our troops in Iraq.This film is so valuable. Not because it argues a position about the war and occupation, but because it simply goes and observes as soldiers work and play, talk and write letters home and, on a daily basis, risk their lives in sudden bursts of violence.One of the most frightening aspects of the movie is the random feeling it conveys. Another is the shock of seeing such very young soldiers, many of them teenagers, caught up in a war they don't really understand.Suggests the primacy of movies in shaping both the reality that led these soldiers to enlist and the one they found in Iraq when they got there.A litmus test for an America scarcely less bitterly divided than Iraq. The risibly dishonest government radio broadcasts play like the satirical radio bits in M*A*S*H.Gunner Palace may present a vision of normalized chaos, a kind of 21st-century M*A*S*H in a volatile urban guerrilla war, but it has nothing but compassion for the men and women in the midst of it.It's important to get some idea of what troops in Iraq are experiencing. For that reason alone, Gunner Palace is a useful, moving look at soldiers on the front lines.Gunner Palace takes the troops seriously, doesn't try to explain their feelings, their sense of commitment to one another and their sense of outrage at the situation.Director Michael Tucker has accomplished something difficult, making a casual though often intense film in the midst of a war zone.Invaluable if incomplete.We don't get to know the soldiers as individuals well enough.I have seen much televised footage of Baghdad from a distance, but I have never before been made aware of how large and built-up a city Baghdad is.A timely and pertinent, if rough-hewn, effort.Good intentions aside, Tucker and codirector Petra Epperlein only further confuse the issue: Their rap-video stylings and use of non-source music create the impression that you're watching characters trapped in a Tom Clancy Xbox game.Gunner Palace gives us the best glimpse yet of what it's like to be in Iraq.As powerful as raining artillery and as listless as a weekend bash at a bombed-out pleasure palace.Too much of the film feels like a slavish imitation of the fictional Apocalypse Now, with Michael Tucker's narration sounding like a parody of Martin Sheen's raspy weariness.Tucker has an eye for arresting imagery, but not the maturity or finesse to illuminate it.Hamstrung by embarrassingly trite narration and a lack of any sort of unifying theme in its editing.The film is more of an anthropological essay on the way young Americans relate while they make war, not love, and try to survive in the meantime.With its title concisely suggesting what we're about to see, Gunner Palace is an Iraq war documentary that seems to lack an agenda. But that doesn't mean it doesn't have a brutally direct question on its mind.For most of us, Michael Tucker and Petra Epperlein's riveting documentary will be as close as we ever get to seeing the Iraq war as it has unfolded for the men and women on the ground.This past week the 1500th American died in Iraq, making the documentary Gunner Palace all too timely.",

Grave of the Fireflies can be grueling - but infinitely more rewarding.Ultimately, the picture's respect for Seito and Setsuko's ability to fend for themselves results in a far more powerful piece of cinema than if they'd been portrayed as the typical scared kid.[Evokes] the experiences of childhood grief, small moments of ordinary life and happiness amid tragedy and fear, and the overwhelming confusion of adult responsibilities falling on teenaged shoulders as powerfully as in any film I've seen.Writer-director Isao Takahata, a frequent collaborator of Miyazaki's at Studio Ghibli, adapted a partly autobiographical novel by Akiyuki Nosaka, and his handling of the tragic story is masterfully understated.haunting...devastatingWhat can you say about an animated movie that brings despair and continually makes your eyes well up with tears?I doubt this story could have been as successful as a straight drama. The spirits of Seita and Setsuko cannot really be filmed except as animated figures.We're so used to seeing the human spirit triumph. Here, we're allowed to understand how it might fail.There are magical moments of natural beauty and childish delight, too - which only make the tragedy even more harrowing.The idea that \"War is Hell\" has almost become something of a climatic clich\u0439, but Takahata's film explores this well-worn slogan from new, exciting and harrowing angles.Isao Takahata's powerful anti-war movie is all the more harrowing for the care we invest in its beautifully drawn children.Isao Takahata's masterpiece is one of the most profound anti-war statements ever brought to cinema...a well-made and heartfelt drama that's just not as engrossing as it should be.Such odd hopefulness, flitting around a child, mixed with the overwhelmingly sad, pervades Isao Takahata's film. And all around Seita and Setsuko, nature, in the face of human destruction and tragedy, persists in its beauty.The stylised images suit the simplicity and gravity of a grim story of love, sacrifice and survival in the face of adult indifference and cruelty.Japanimation WWII tragedy the saddest. Cartoon. Ever.The ephemeral fireflies, which fascinate the children and accompany them everywhere, become a potent and lyrical symbol of the fragility, brevity and beauty of life.A very moving, but depressing movie.One of the most devastating anti-war films ever made, animated or otherwise.... a beautiful lament and a moving tribute to the people we rarely consider when we think about World War 2: those Japanese who suffered for the crimes of their leaders.Incredibly moving. The ultimate tear-jerker.Very simply the gentlest and most touching war-related film I've ever seen.Um retrato sem concess\u0445es do horror da guerra e de suas conseq\u044c\u043ancias n\u0433o apenas sobre a sociedade, mas sobre indiv\u043dduos comuns. Emocionalmente devastador.Takahata's alternately sweeping and intimate animated feature is a moving depiction of the fates of cast-off children who become casualties of war.Even though it's not exactly easy to watch the protracted deaths of two children, this is not only one of the greatest anime ever, but also an important (anti-) war film. A moving masterpiece.Quivers with every kind of wracking emotion: rage, sorrow, despair, fatigue, and in the end, a tiny measure of hope that perhaps there's something better than this in the next world.The wonderful lasting mark of a true artist.",

For while most makeover movies feature a female making herself more attractive, this flick has a male deliberately doing the opposite.Freshman Orientation feels a bit like a missed opportunity. It's too bad the motion picture as a whole isn't as quirky and clever as its double-edged title.There are other things to like about writer-director Ryan Shiraki's college comedy, mainly that it feels more real than most... Just one problem: It isn't particularly funny.Theatres showing it will likely have as many conspicuously empty seats as the classrooms and barrooms in this picture, which was apparently shot on such a shoestring that they couldn't even get enough extras to fill a set.OK, it's official: I no longer care about 18 year olds....too often feels more like a tapped-out keg than a provocative romp.Freshman Orientation barely rates a passing grade.The film's abundant humor and sharp tongue give way to watery romantic-comedy conventions in the end.I was honored and privileged to say that I saw a film at Sundance that actually captured the fun of pretending to be gay to win a sorority sister.Blessedly shrewd where it counts and deserves notice. The lessons develop naturally and aren't jammed down the viewer's throat like the hypocritical sermonizing in I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry.Freshman Orientation is not incompetently made. Nor is it badly acted. But there's not a fresh idea in it, and everyone on screen seems to be in a different comedy.This trivial film toys with the postmodern lifestyles.You enter expecting something really stupid, and you wind up with something really clever . . . hysterical . . . wise.Admirably aiming to recreate the feelings of newfound freedom and self-discovery that college inspires, Freshman Orientation never finds a way to successfully execute its good intentions....might push boundaries better were it not so painfully unfunny.John Goodman has a nice turn as a queen with a heart of gold.A campus comedy with a dirty mouth, an innocent heart and a surprisingly wise mind, Freshman Orientation uses identity politics as a road to romance and emotional maturity. The naked breasts are a bonus....goes way over the top for the Greeks vs. Gays climax.Consider my two-star rating an indication that the film's Gut-Buster-to-Forehead-Slapper ratio is relatively even.The charms of this college gross-out comedy with a \"message\" are elusive.",

This mob tale shimmers with sparkling dialogue.A screenplay of pure gold. I still think it's the best Coens film yet.It is consistently good, but I suppose I have come to expect more from the Coens.As for that story, it's good enough, but honestly I fail to see what everyone's all worked up about.Even though the plot is propelled by lust and vengeance, there's no heat in the movie.An amazingly entertaining film, loaded with zesty dialogue, gorgeously staged sequences and a bevy of wild characters.It's arguably the US mainstream's first art movie since Days of Heaven; and quite wonderful.Loosley based on Hammett's novel and Chicago's Capone-O'Bannion gang war, the film is more impressive visually than thematically, though new angle of placing Irish, Italian, and Jewish gangsters in the same tale is intriguing.It takes place in an artificial world constructed largely from the mythology of other movies, and, though it's both seamless and stylish, some find it a little too self-conscious for its own good.Substance is here in spades, along with the twisted, brilliantly controlled style on which filmmakers Joel and Ethan Coen made a name.The Coens' take on Depression-era gangster flicks, looks gorgeous and showcases John Turturro's best acting ever.It never fully convinces in terms of either period or plot....joke-heavy and bullet-riddled and studded with some of the most crackling dialogue heard since 'The Front Page.'[The Coen brothers'] most complicated and dense movie.Up there with the Coen brothers' finest work.It has always been one of the special pleasures of movies that they dream worlds and map them at the same time. Miller's Crossing dreams a beaut......whether we're supposed to take it as a dark comedy or a straightforward melodrama is up to the viewer. A little of both, maybe. The Coens have always been a little twisted.If Miller's Crossing isn't my favourite movie, I don't know what is.The Coens play this icy gangster tale mostly straight, but they can't help throwing in a few of their dark, comic explosions; it's one of their best, most cohesive films and it holds up to repeated viewings.Perhaps the best the Coens have to offer -- stylish, funny, harrowing and brilliantly shot.The story isn't the film's major draw anyway...it's the look.Um dos melhores trabalhos dos Coen (e isto \u0436 um baita elogio), o filme conta um roteiro muito bem amarrado, atua\u0443\u0448es intensas e um visual fabuloso.A stylized reworking of the generic gangster film.Engrossing crime story with top notch acting.Without much point at all.Pays homage to the crime novels of Dashiell Hammett.There's plenty of snappy plotting and double-crossing around it, with bitter twists and well-delivered, wonderfully literate, hard-nosed dialogue.As disturbing and densely beautiful as its opening image.Crossing is the kind of movie that benefits from a second sitting, to get a complete grip on the plot.While Miller's Crossing is not as messy or inspired as Martin Scorsese's GoodFellas, or as richly suggestive as The Godfather, it accomplishes exactly what it sets out to do.There is a lot here to admire.The story, which is extremely labyrinthine and complex, is nevertheless one that is endlessly fascinating.While it unfolds, the viewer is entirely in thrall.",

        "document": "The result is at once a document of destruction (via narration and newsreel footage), an indictment of the world community, and a testimony to the resilience of those abandoned people.One of the best ways to make a large catastrophe comprehensible to the average joe is by showing it through the eyes of one personA tragic reminder of how that overused epithet, 'Never again', makes hypocrites of us all.Tries to tell two stories -- the story of the genocide and the story of Rom\u00e9o Dallaire -- and it doesn't quite succeed at either.We never get a satisfying re-creation of the events for which Dallaire now suffers.In a way, Shake Hands With the Devil puts the best of Western conscience on display -- and it's not a pretty sight.... blunt, somewhat artless, but very effective.Offers a rare and privileged portrait of a heroic man profoundly troubled by a terrible experience.Terrible to watch. And that's exactly why it needs to be seen.[Dallaire] makes for a fascinating focal point ... a fundamentally decent man, cursed with a horribly total recall. He can't stop seeing it.Wrenching on both personal and political levels.Dellaire's final bit of self-abuse is to blame himself for his failure to shame the world to action.His story is worth telling, and worth remembering for what it tells us about the West's brutal disinterest in Africa, and the United Nations' inability to do even its most basic job of keeping the peace.Dallaire's horrifying memoir casts the sudden, savage murder of 800,000 Rwandans as a foreseeable event that could have been easily prevented had any country in the international community cared to even try.It gives us a man who could have stopped the carnage -- 800,000 murdered in 100 days -- but whose hands were bound at the highest level. He knows this, it haunts him, and if it doesn't shame you, it should.Shake Hands is less about one man than about a U.N. structurally incapable of carrying out its peacekeeping mandate, then and now.Romeo Dallaire seems to be the only human in the world with a conscience. That it's eating him alive makes Shake Hands required viewing, perhaps even at the UN.Peter Raymont's film is a respectful portrait of Rom\u00e9o Dallaire, the Canadian commander of the United Nations peacekeeping force in Rwanda in 1994.It's a highly moving film and also an angry one.Extols the power of truth over fiction.Gut-wrenching, incredibly moving, and informative about a man who still suffers and a country that still mourns.A personalized, historically charged travelogue that speaks to a massive tragedy's impact on one man.An overpowering film that will leave viewers shaken and ashamed.The documentary tends to focus more on Dallaire's plight than that of the massacred Rwandans, but it remains a powerful testament.A flat-lined, pedestrian affair, a talking-heads/ touring-heads piece that seems to point the camera in the wrong direction.A searing indictment of the tragedy that occurs when good men choose to do nothing, and a portrait of a man who deserves respect for having tried to confront evil head-on.Raymont gets the most out of what little footage and still photographs remain from 1994.Documentary should have been more about what happened in Rwanda rather than just about his personal feelings and his return trip. Very one-side picture of a highly criticized UN official. Paul Chambers, CNN.The documentary is effective, though at times it's a challenge to watch.You can't imagine a worse situation, but at the same time it's hard to imagine that a better man could've been on the scene, even if he was rendered powerless in the face of evil.Dallaire's tragic story is a fascinating chapter in a sad history.More than finger pointing and a recap of events. By delving into Dallaire's psyche, it becomes an emotional and poignant journey.Poses an essential question: How can you shame an international community that, even now, seems constitutionally incapable of it?It's a gripping film and a story that demands telling.Raymont's film, with Dallaire as the main voice and news footage from 1994, lays out a compelling, compact story.[It] will leave you speechless.The filmmakers follow this compassionate and articulate man as returns to Rwanda a decade later to revisit his demons.A fascinating account of its subject's self-torture over his inability to stop one of the 20th century's greatest tragedies.Shake Hands With the Devil gives us the flip side [of Hotel Rwanda].There are two fascinating stories here - the genocide and the personal aftermath - but Raymont succeeds only partly in the first and not at all in the second.Dallaire is not only the protagonist of Shake Hands, he is a compelling reason to see it.This wonderful, devastating documentary is as much Dallaire's story as it is the story of a whole continent abandoned by a cynical world.Through it all is Dallaire himself, a woeful, pitiable figure, the stuff of Shakespearean tragedy. He had only the noblest intentions and was thwarted.Like Dallaire's bestselling autobiography, which provides the movie's basis, the film is part therapeutic personal exorcism and part passionate humanitarian indictment.A far more resonant film than that offered by concurrent narrative feature Hotel Rwanada.",

        "document": "You'll never eat chicken again!Mr. Hitchcock and his associates have constructed a horror film that should raise the hackles of the most courageous and put goose-pimples on the toughest hide.It's fierce and Freudian as well as great cinematic fun, with ample fodder for the amateur psychologist following up on Hitch's tortuous involvement with his leading ladies.Inventive classic.Mediocre as melodrama, but the signature avian attacks are without equal.This masterpiece is one of Hitchcock's purest forays into cinema; it's such a complete piece that it even gets by with two mediocre actors.Still a dream come true after you've met enough Californians.What sets The Birds apart from the other films in Hitchcock's incredible ten-year run between 1954 and 1964 is its remarkable chilliness.Underestimated at the time, this is Hitchcok's last undisputed masterpiece, and a more complex film than PsychoTechnically, the best Hitchcock ever...and one of the most nail-biting.The Birds is most notable though for turning something completely harmless into an incredible menace -- all with absolutely no explanation.More novelty than spectacle, but overall a chilling exercise in nihilistic terror.The Birds is a textbook exercise in taking a simple story and creating a devastating film.Few films depict so eerily yet so meticulously the metaphysical and historical sense of a world out of joint.Hitch's much misappreciated follow-up to Psycho is arguably the greatest of all disaster films -- a triumph of special effects, as well as the fountainhead of what has become known as gross-out horror.This Hitchcock classic somehow strayed from favour for a while, yet in the realm of popular mythology it is now rivalled only by Vertigo or Psycho.Drawing from the relatively invisible literary talents of Daphne DuMaurier and Evan Hunter, Alfred Hitchcock has fashioned a major work of cinematic art, and \"cinematic\" is the operative term here, not \"literary\" or \"sociological.\"In the thick of an impeccable narrative that pays deep attention to all those involved, the great filmmaker manages to reach far inside the psychological chasm and find a rich inspiration.Though it lacks the psychological depth of Hitchcock's greatest works, it's characterised by a nightmarish simplicity.The true genius of the film, based on a 1952 short story by Daphne du Maurier, is the way Hitchcock makes the malevolent birds seem like manifestations of his characters' mental unease.The picture pursues these false clues with excessive long-windedness and occasional fatuity. It is a tribute to Hitchcock's mastery of his craft that, even so, he makes overpoweringly real the menace of the birds.What starts out as a kind of low-key screwball comedy ends up as an effective, fright-filled horror flick.The Birds represents better than any other Hitchcock film the extreme polarities of his universe: vicious unpredictability and moral and emotional disorder on the one hand, and rigorous stylistic control and formal organization, on the other.Classic Hitchcock horror film still gives the chills.The Birds is an effective horror movie, although in typical Hitchcock style, there is far more scary anticipation than actual gore.The Birds (1963), another Hitchcock thriller/masterpiece, his first film with Universal Studios, is the apocalyptic story of a northern California coastal townEven at his worst, Hitch still puts a smile on your face!Only Alfred Hitchcock could take a premise which is so patently ridiculous -- the birds come to life and try to kill everybody -- and construct a beautifully realized thriller.Hitchcock creature-feature gets off the ground but never soars....The Birds features characters worth rooting for and quirky little touches of morbid humour...Beneath all of this elaborate feather bedlam lies a Hitch cock-and-bull story that's essentially a fowl ball.Alfred Hitchcock's most abstract film (1963), and perhaps his subtlest, still yielding new meanings and inflections after a dozen or more viewings.One of Hitchcock's most overrated picturesUnmistakably, one of the master's best.The movie is a textbook of brilliantly edited set pieces and ingenious uses of color, sound, and landscape.The only thing dated is the special effects. The suspense holds up very well.Although not as horrifically shocking as \"Psycho,\" \"The Birds\" is a more sophisticated film, and represents a high watermark in the prolific career of a true maestro of cinema.The movie flaps to a plotless end.Perhaps only a director of Hitchcock's caliber can make such a fowl story fly.Feels like it was made by a brilliant filmmaker who simply felt challenged by the enormity of the task. In that regard, it's close to 100 percent successful.Hailed as one of Hitchcock's masterpieces by some and despised by others, The Birds is certainly among the director's more complex and fascinating works.Maybe not quite the pinnacle of Hitchcock's career but definitely in the top five.Genuinely disturbing thriller classic from the master of suspense.",

        "document": "In the end, this melancholy, inspiriting movie achieves a breathtaking emotional harmoniousness.So Yong Kim has made another minimalist masterpiece, a quiet movie of sharply observed details and two girls who will break your heart.I crossed. It's the sort of \"slice of life\" that defies words, which is perhaps why these little girls and their overwhelmingly grey world are rendered in such quietude.So Yong Kim's quiet film which takes its time observing the minutiae of every day life has an undercurrent of grander themes at play.Whatever magic filmmaker So Yong Kim used to get the two girls to feel so at ease, you wish she would have used a little of that on the rest of the film as well. While it is a fairly realistic and no-frills drama, it's also dull.Relying on the essentially inert performances of child actors, So Yong Kim draws on a deep understanding of how movies work but also taps into her own experiences. That's a potent combination....requires the commitment by the viewer to get involved in the lives of the little girls. But, for the real film buff, this is a true labor of love and worth the effort.Treeless Mountain casts a sad, pellucid spell. It looks at life from three feet off the ground and meets the hardening gaze of its 6-year-old protagonist head on.So Yong Kim's remarkable film never spells out exactly what Jin or Bin is thinking, the camera implies how they see.Kim is deft and sensitive with her tiny co-stars, but Treeless Mountain lacks the freshness and surprise of In Between Days.What makes this slight narrative compelling is that it is told entirely from the children's point of view, synced to their perceptions and to the mercurial emotions that color them.This very personal, naturalistic Korean film is all about emotional damage, and it's a real heartbreaker.[The film provides] an enveloping, but plausible recreation of a child's perspective -- fascinated by minutiae, sensitive to pain, and unaware of the workings of time.Treeless Mountain, in its crisp simplicity, resembles a good poem, with many layers lurking beneath the organized, metered surface.Cinematographer Anne Misawa shoots from a low angle the wonderful, subtly expressive faces of the siblings, the older melancholic, the younger endearingly clownish.While this minimalist tale could have been heartbreaking, what's most affecting is not the kids' plight but their pluck.There is no profound drama here, however, so you might end up resenting the film while it drags from you the emotional responses that the sight of anxious little children inevitably triggers.Drawing out beautifully natural performances from her child actors, Kim once again has a distinct way of letting her camera observe her characters with kind thoughtfulness, allowing for a quiet mood to wash over the scenes.Gentle and observational, this slice-of-life from Korea has only the thinnest frame of a plot as it follows two young girls on a dramatic journey. But it's so vague that audiences will find it hard to latch onto.So Yong eschews drama for a quiet sensitivity which suggests the young can get over almost anything adults put upon them simply with native wit and resource.Avoiding sentiment and whimsicality, the director coaxes exquisite performances from her dauntless leads as they bemusedly try to make sense of the grown-ups' aberrant behaviour.A glowing reminiscence of a difficult childhood, further illuminated by lovely performances, directorial nuance and gorgeous visuals.Occasionally drags, but it nonetheless manages to be a quietly engrossing, well-nuanced and sensitive drama filled with exquisite cinematography.The big payoff moment is so small and passes so quietly that it's almost unbearably beautiful.At times, Treeless Mountain almost feels like a fairy tale -- but without the magic.Too many filmmakers look down -- literally and figuratively -- on children. But in the carefully observed Treeless Mountain, So Young Kim gets us to immediately identify with her young heroines.Both lovely and wrenching, So Yong Kim's intimate drama feels so honest, it's often difficult to watch.Children rule the day in this semi-autobiographical film by new film maker So Yong Kim but it comes off more as an exercise in filmmaking than entertainment.A surrealistic charmer blessed with some breathtaking cinematography.Kim is undoubtedly a skilled director, but she's someone who seems more content to observe than state.very real magic emanates from Treeless Mountain like vapor from a block of dry iceTreeless Mountain has the tang of real life, though this is realism that has been filtered through 60 or so years of world art cinema.[An] affecting, semiautobiographical story of two sisters from Seoul who are abandoned by their parents at a brutally tender age.Interesting if occasionally limiting.Somewhere in between all the emptiness -- the film's laconic chapters are separated by repeated static shots of clouds and sky -- a beautiful little point is made.It's subtle, moving and, despite the grim subject, hopeful.In modest, lovingly observed ways, the director gives her characters -- and, one hazards, herself -- the gentlest gift of sweet possibility.Packed with moments that are both heartwarming and heartbreaking.The film's desire to avoid enforcing a story arc on the girls - who remain in a state of constant bemusement through out - makes it difficult to engage with the film as a whole.A series of plotless, episodic incidents that slowly build to understated emotional crescendos...the film is tender, touching and charming, a portrait of quiet resilience and sisterly devotion...So Yong Kim has a real gift for putting children at ease before the camera, and her two very young actresses (who are not sisters off-screen) reward her with performances of heartbreaking realism.The film is spare and a bit static, the plot a buildup of mundane moments, but Kim's conceptual smarts and firm direction are impressive, as are the performances from such little children.A sparse but incredibly moving film about love turning to longing turning to resentment.A wonder-inducing drama about a six-year-old Korean girl who takes on adult responsibilities when she and her little sister are abandoned by their mother.Skillfully unsentimental -- because of, but also despite, the presence of two irresistible, unself-conscious performers in virtually every scene.Deeply rooted in the perspectives of its ill-fated heroines, Treeless Mountain finds a place in the modern abandoned-child narratives alongside Ramin Bahrani's Chop Shop and the inferior period piece Blame It On Fidel.The problem with this American indie filmed in Korea is that, despite the captivating faces and sad predicament of these little girls, nothing much happens.With Treeless Mountain, Kim establishes herself as a first-class filmmaker.The writer-director So Yong Kim, drawing on events from her childhood, directs so unobtrusively you may forget the camera is there, but you won't forget its evocation of a child's yearning for a missed parent.The low-key Korean drama Treeless Mountain speaks volumes about the heartbreak and resilience of childhood.A work of tremendous poise and poignancy that assumes and articulates the perspective and emotional tenor of its two juvenile protagonists.Is it fair for the director to strip away so much and leave us feeling so helpless? I'm still in pain; I don't know.It's a familiar subject, well handled and performed.Like breath on the window of a late-night bus, Treeless Mountain is a work of diaphanous and fugitive beauty.A film of small gestures closely observed, it's surprisingly unsentimental, despite its heart-tugging qualities.A beautiful, meditative and deeply humanistic coming-of-age tale dealing with abandonment, resilience and perseverance in the face of apparent futility.[The Film] offers a stark analysis of the human potential for random cruelty that recalls nothing less than Bresson's 'Mouchette', albeit with a denouement that holds a glimmer of optimism for the future.Wonderful performances from the two young leads and a gently heart-breaking narrative arc make this a slow winner.Not an easy watch, but worth sticking with.A touching, gentle examination of the giddy rush and sickening sense of dislocation that comes with being left on your own when you're young.",

Instead, [director] Yung trains his lens mainly on the cultural impact.Visually stunning, this documentary by Chinese-Canadian filmmaker Yung Chang is part travelogue, part social critique of China's economic miracle and the sweeping cultural changes it is forcing in its wake.Chang gracefully juxtaposes the country and the metropolitan to express the knotted-up mixture of anguish, anger, hope, and trepidation of those in the dammed river's wake.This, the film argues, is the way of the future: One form of poverty-stricken squalor replaced by a tackier, more plasticized life of similarly deadend subservience, all in the guise of economic progress.Myth and reality, past and present, tradition and progress go head to head in Yung Chang's remarkable documentary about China's longest river, Up the Yangtze.The tone is finally one of wistful resignation.Up the Yangtze provides a devastating view of top-down, broad-stroke social programs.floats across the screen, leaving indelible metaphoric imagery of China's rapidly changing way of lifeIf Up the Yangtze makes you think, 'How can a film so lovely be about something so horrible?' then it has done its job.Like all the best documentaries, Up the Yangtze shows us something we've never seen before, with insight and meaning. Up the Ynagtze goes down in movie history as a work of lasting valueThe movie never editorializes; it simply presents. It is tragedy, not statistics.Though it is a bit slow-moving, this documentary feature is visually stunning.A searing lament for China and the eradication of its historic farming culture, Yangtze is a stunning documentary that details every gut-churning step of inevitability.Yung gets to the broken heart of a dying culture by conveying the impact of the dam on two individuals affected by, and participating in, the government's vision for 'progress.'Very visually documents the human cost of the abrupt changes in the Chinese economy, and intimately into the sociological changes wrought by the astounding Three Gorges Dam.Modernization is a double-edged sword as this superb documentary illustrates.Up the Yangtze drips with irony, something only the rich can afford.Chang's fluid camera captures the river's vanishing beauty, as well as the dichotomy between Yu Shui's rural poverty and Chen Bo Yu's urban lifestyle.[Induces] culture shock at discovering [an] unseen world...A cruise on the Yangtze, site of the Three Gorges Dam (the largest hydroelectric project in the world) is a fitting metaphor for the promise and cost of China's rapid modernization.Up the Yangtze is a reminder that every little family matters and that economic miracles are zero-sum games.Yung Chang's always illuminating, often heart-rending, documentary.With all these lyrical elements in play, [director Yung] Chang's extraneous voiceover narration is baffling, and all but unbearable.By journey's end, Chang has found, in the Yangtze, a brilliant natural metaphor for upward mobility in modern China: Whether they hail from the lowlands or the urban centers, everyone here is scrambling to reach higher ground.[Director Yung Chang] and lenser Wang Shi Qing use powerful images, subtlety and a little humour to apprise the viewer of the human and cultural issues at stake.No one (as far as we see) died. Progress advanced. A sad, slow lament in the music ebbs away.One of the real pluses of Up the Yangtze, aside from its empathy with its subjects, is its striking visual quality.This is a sad film to be sure, but highly accomplished and very effective.What Chinese Canadian filmmaker Yung Chang achieves in his documentary Up the Yangtze is remarkable.In personalizing Mao's gargantuan Three Gorges Dam project, Yung Chang enables us to connect emotionally ... with the millions whose homes and livelihoods have been snatched out from under them ...Far too many disparate themes are never woven together to explain the underlying purpose of the film's journey.Up the Yangtze is a beautifully crafted documentary. Chang displays artistry in the way he assembles his material. He captures China at a crossroads where he finds both guarded hope and epic sadness.China is on the world's mind. The once-mysterious communist \"enemy\" is now the economic friend of all the essential profiteers. Up the Yangtze is a new documentary that expounds upon China in transition.Chang's sensitive observational style allows the contrast between the unreality of the ship and the crushing hardship of the lives of Yu Shui's family to develop naturallyUp The Yangtze goes from sleepily hypnotic to riveting over the course of 90 minutes.China's public image suffers another blow with Up the Yangtze, a docu mentary by Chinese-Canadian Yung Chang.A gloriously cinematic doc of epic, poetic sadness.Its range of subjects and emotions cuts a surprisingly wide swath.almost unbearably intimateNo words could be more eloquent or descriptive than Chang and cinematographer Wang Shi Qing's amazing footage.Up the Yangtze shows us the individual impact of a big picture that is changing the lives of millions.For all its tranquil pace, Up The Yangtze captures perfectly a sense of frenzy and discontent that permeates everything.Filmmaker Yung Chang finds a sad and beautiful way to glimpse the big picture of dislocation through an exquisitely poised small study.Yung Chang is a Canadian director whose grandparents came from China, and his witty, lovely and profoundly unsettling documentary Up the Yangtze takes him back to the legendary river of his grandfather's homeland, now transformed beyond recognition.In his masterful and haunting documentary Up the Yangtze, Yung Chang shows the old China drowning helplessly under the weight of the new.Just where is China taking us besides up the Yangtze River? Mr. Yung's film does not even pretend to know, and that is its great strength as it plunges more deeply into the truly unknown.",

        "document": "An unusually cheery movie from veteran British writer-director Mike Leigh; one of the ten best films of 2008Happy-Go-Lucky is flibbertigibbet cinema. Mike Leigh directed Sally Hawkins in this paean to a peahen. Mike Leigh, let me introduce you to Fran Drescher, Kathy Griffin, and Nancy Grace. They're your kind of women.England's addlepated answer to Amelie!Fresh, spunky and well acted. Sally Hawkins is enchanting and the rest of the cast is enjoyable.Few actors could have pulled off this role successfully, as it requires great energy, charisma and depth to make Poppy credible and so much more than first impressions.Sally Hawkins is a comic revelation, an impish, endlessly charming sprite...Leigh's most visually beautiful picture since Topsy-Turvy, Happy-Go-Lucky is all about the clashing and connecting of such emotional biospheres.While Sally Hawkins turns out an award-worthy performance as Poppy, I quickly became bored with her life and all the turmoil surrounding it.You just want to protect her, from the world, from everything, but really she's much stronger than you are.If you leave the theater feeling uplifted (and unless your heart is made of cold gray concrete, you will), it wasn't due to manipulation, but a result of the film having honestly earned it.It's rather grim, the laughs are few, and the only lesson it teaches is that, for all its sins, Hollywood is much better at making this kind of life-affirming Pollyanna movie.Absolutely extraordinary in its grounded optimism, Happy-Go-Lucky features an Oscar-worthy performance from Sally Hawkins that must not, cannot be ignored.This is a film to share with a friend or loved one; you'll have plenty to discuss and laugh about afterward.There is something infectious and unique about Poppy's joy, and Leigh seems to have caught the bug. Poppy can't make everyone happy, but for many of us, she'll do all right.A character study in the classic sense of the phrase, featuring a lead who will stick with you for days and weeks to come. It's easily one of the best movies of the year.One of the best films of 2008 and one of the finest films to date from a man commonly regarded as one of the world's greatest filmmakers.I really thought I might really grow tired of her quickly, but by the end I had nothing but admiration.The new Mike Leigh film, Happy-Go-Lucky, is a real pleasure, and besides being Leigh's most buoyantly comic feature it's a marvelous showcase for Sally Hawkins, who has worked twice before with the British writer-director.It feels modest while you're watching it, but the more I think about it, the more I love it.Happy-Go-Lucky doesn't provide many insights (even Poppy seems ultimately unsure about whether happiness can be a permanent condition), but it does provide a little joy -- and that's worth celebrating, at the movies and elsewhere.Yes, Sally Hawkins does an amazing job, but she also plays a type of person that the majority of us can't stand. It's beyond Poppy's positive outlook.The intentions of this oddity are muddled, but the small portraits of ordinary people choosing their path through the daily range of depression and delight are fully alive.Leigh pushes the story in a more interesting direction, asking whether people find happiness or simply will it on themselves.Mike Leigh, cockeyed optimist?Leigh's creation is fixed and unchangeable, admirably optimistic as a person but completely unengaging as a movie character.She is charming and funny, and her blithe, carefree spirit actually comes across as a legitimate way of dealing with life -- or, at the very least, as being better than some of the alternatives.British director Mike Leigh has made the first great comedy for our new depression.Sally Hawkins, in a blinding, Oscar-worthy piece of acting so good you barely see it, plays Poppy, a perpetually upbeat elementary schoolteacher in London.I've never used this clich\u00e9 in a review before, and God forbid I ever use it again, so pay close attention: Happy-Go-Lucky is the feel-good movie of the year.It's a powerful argument for optimism.Indeed, playing someone sunny without making them totally irritating might be more of a challenge than portraying Lady Macbeth, and Hawkins makes Poppy's good cheer pragmatic and personable.Strange but wonderful ... up there with some of Leigh's best movies, driven by riveting performances from Sally Hawkins and Eddie Marsan.The trouble is that the movie in which Poppy does, in fact, exist never quite rises to her level.Poppy is upbeat \u2014 so relentlessly upbeat that it won't take long before you're wondering just how the director plans to wipe the smile off her face.The buoyant tone of Leigh's latest, Happy-Go-Lucky, is such an unexpected and welcome change-of-pace. For his part, Leigh is just as grumpy as ever, but he has produced a motion picture that can best be described as optimistic.Writer-director Leigh, maintaining a deceptively freewheeling tone throughout, creates a comedy that's also something much more.The sunshiny primary-school teacher nicknamed Poppy (Sally Hawkins) in Mike Leigh's exuberant comedy Happy-Go-Lucky is the kind of relentless optimist one might worry about in real life.It is a rare blessing to have movies like Happy-Go-Lucky and Rachel Getting Married arrive back to back.At the very least, the spectacle of Poppy's devotion and desire, not to mention her all-around sunny disposish, left this viewer feeling unaccountably happy -- at least for the moment.We take Mike Leigh's gifts for granted, knowing the collaborative nature of his filmmaking will inevitably produce something brimming with humanity. Yet what the director and cast do with this character study is miraculous.This is writer/director Mike Leigh's best film since 1993's \"Naked\" and, in a sense, its photo negative twin - female centric as opposed to male, light vs. dark, optimistic vs. nihilistic...There are times during Happy-Go-Lucky where Poppy is entirely endearing and others where she comes off as the bubbliest of emotional terrorists, but Leigh never emphasizes one facet as paramount over another.Oddball and ingenious.I want to believe in someone like [Poppy]. I want to believe life can be approached from such an uncompromisingly joyous perspective.As refreshing as it is to find a movie that leaves you smiling, it's something much rarer to discover a film that makes you think about what a commitment to happiness really means.An oddball British movie that makes a courageous attempt to profile a woman who lives up to the title, always, in every situation.It's a small, radiant gem in a movie season cluttered with rhinestones. You leave the theater feeling both clearheaded and buoyant.Director Mike Leigh creates an air-headed vision of inner contentment in the guise of 30-year-old British primary school teacher and student driver Poppy (played by Sally Hawkins).As Poppy likes to say, it's lovely.Cute but inconsequential, pleasant to a degree but so willowy that it hardly seems to exist at all.One of the best portraits of an enthusiastic person ever put on the screen.He may be taking a breather, but this is still a Mike Leigh actors' showcase; expect to hear more about Sally Hawkins (and the amazing \"En-rah-ha\" Eddie Marsan) as Oscar season approaches.Happy-Go-Lucky is triumphant proof that a creative middle way is always possible.Like Poppy herself, Happy-Go-Lucky is deceptively simple, thoroughly charming and always surprising.I was ready to give it a negative review, but when the movie turned out to have a point, I realized that it was kind of brilliant.The movie isn't witty or memorable, but it keeps you on edge, and it's the first war-on-terror film to weave its anti-U.S. politics so deeply into the narrative that the characters don't need to speechify.[Leigh's] legitimately uplifting film benefits from its own refusal to unduly sentimentalize or moralize.this adeptly-made movie will wake us up to how cynical we really are (in comparison to Mike Leigh's the title character).Hawkins' Poppy charms us even as she makes us concerned about what all the giggling is covering up. She is, after all, a very sympathetic case study.Deceptively lighthearted, Mike Leigh's new film offers a sober, poignant look at the difficulties of maintaining happiness in our harsh modern world, boasting a towering, Oscar-worthy performance from Sally Hawkins.A lighter register than most Leigh films, but the content is as psychologically and dramatically rich as ever.A wonderfully life-affirming tale of a woman who always looks on the bright side of things...[which avoids] either comic caricature or teary treacle.Coming from the man who made his name as a director of often grim social-realist films such as Vera Drake, All or Nothing and Secrets & Lies, Mike Leigh's Happy-Go-Lucky strikes one as a film fantasy.The British actress Sally Hawkins delivers a nervy, utterly captivating tour de force performance in Happy-Go-Lucky, Mike Leigh's transporting new film.Expertly directed by Mike Leigh, Happy-Go-Lucky is not only joyous but substantial.Sally Hawkins been in movies before, including Leigh's \"Vera Drake\" and Woody Allen's \"Cassandra's Dream,\" but this is her star-making role. She was named best actress at Berlin 2008. I will deliberately employ a cliche: She is a joy to behold.I kept hoping Miss Happy-Go-Lucky would get cancer.Mr. Leigh has executed a richly exuberant entertainment for our troubled times, and deserves still another of my honorary Oscars for his astoundingly skillful effort.Happy-Go-Lucky isn't one of Leigh's epic social canvases like Secrets & Lies or even Topsy-Turvy; rather, it's an edgy character study whose message only gradually emerges.Happy-Go-Lucky is some sort of cinematic proof that beauty is in the eye of the beholder.Frivolity is used as a tool to unmask anger and Leigh's mastery has never been more apparent than in the creation of his richly layered charactersAt 65, director Mike Leigh proves an old dog can turn new tricks.It's an exhilarating film, one of the best he has given us.In the end, Hawkins' vivid characterization alone justifies Happy-Go-Lucky. The hamfistedness of the script sadly undermines what probably should have registered as a towering performance....a slightly uneven yet thoroughly engaging slice-of-life effort from writer/director Mike Leigh.Poppy is almost a real person, waiting for us somewhere in London, humming to herself and wearing her favorite tan boots.This gangly brunette is bananas, and the music on the soundtrack is perfectly in sync with her kooky mode of social expression, so that she suggests Mary Pickford as well as Polly Jean Harvey.Hawkins is delightful, connecting with the audience when a lesser actress would have been merely cloying in the role.In the factory-farmed blandness of the movies, Happy-Go-Lucky has a strong, real taste.Very funny and, despite the lack of a central plot, finds surprising truth in its characters.There are no house-call abortionists or down-on-their-luck families who only find hope in the next pint, just a chipper Finsbury Park bird who always looks at the brighter sideThe opening scenes of Mike Leigh's latest slice-of-life dramedy Happy-Go-Lucky introduce a protagonist who appears psychologically disordered at worst, and highly annoying at best.Happy-Go-Lucky doesn't condemn the optimistic way Poppy approaches life. It's wondering why there aren't more people like her.Thoughtful comedy's charm outweighs mild iffiness.I don't know how Mike Leigh does it.Has feel-good factor in super-abundance.Watching Mike Leigh's sublimely fresh Happy-Go-Lucky, you could be forgiven for wondering what the rest of humanity is so depressed about, anyway.Happy-Go-Lucky is closely tuned to the pulse of communal life, to the rhythms of how people work, play and struggle together.So joyous and uplifting that you just want to pluck it off the screen, put it in your pocket and carry it around with you.Your tolerance for it all will depend heavily on whether you consider Hawkins' mannered performance insufferably cloying or irresistibly charming.Like anyone given over to giggling more than griping, Poppy - and as an indirect result, Happy-Go-Lucky - slowly becomes addictive.Initially, the new Mike Leigh film, \"Happy-Go-Lucky,\" is so overbearing, it's a turn-off. But b the end of it, you might be calling it \"Up with Poppy.\"I found Poppy to be annoying, bordering on the delusional, but of course I'm a big old crab.Stop the presses! A favorable portrayal of a happy person in a movie!A cute but shallow and generally sloppy enterprise.The inexplicably overrated, overbearing and overly improvised tale of peppy PoppyThe scenes between Poppy (Sally Hawkins) and driving-instructor Scott (Eddie Marsan) have real bite.Happy-Go-Lucky isn't just a film that demonstrates the goodness of humankind, but makes you believe in it as well.Almost like viewing a nature documentary. I could imagine David Attenborough's voice: 'See here this woman whose way of positively viewing life can grate on those around her.'The main character in Happy-Go-Lucky will drive you to distraction. But just try looking away.A delightful comedy that sinks its teeth into your heart with unexpected power.A light-hearted look at a free spirit, with some funny and thought-provoking moments.A film that should be required viewing nationwide. A good blast of fresh air that sweeps you off your feet.Fresh, funny and uplifting. A zingy, irresistible sorbet of light-footed comedy and everyday humanity. Only hardened churls will roll their weary eyes at Hawkins' gusto. Leigh's most open and optimistic film since Life Is Sweet.An improvisational comedy drama, it's very funny and establishes Hawkins as a major talent to watch.Happy-Go-Lucky might have sit-com spin-off potential, but like one of Poppy's driving lessons, it lurches around, grinding gears, and ends up back where it started.It's a funny film - a surprise perhaps after 'Vera Drake' - and, crucially, it aches with truth.Mike Leigh draws a bravura performance out of Sally Hawkins, and she in return makes Poppy one of Leigh's best characters yet - up there with the likes of Vera Drake or Beverly from Abigail's Party.'Enormous crowd-pleaser' and 'directed by Mike Leigh' were not phrases this critic ever thought he would be putting together in the same sentence, but Leigh's Happy-Go-Lucky is exactly that.The character of Poppy is an entirely original female film protagonist, sort of a British working class version of Annie Hall.The way these two characters react to each other while staying completely in character displays Leigh's method the way nothing else can.Is it possible to enjoy the company of the world's most irritating woman? Mike Leigh's surprisingly sunny dramedy makes a pretty good case that, in fact, it is.The key to enjoying the film, a minor effort by Leigh, is warming up to Poppy. Her bubbly personality may be too much for some. She's like a walking, talking smiley face.It is a decidedly clear-eyed exploration of the challenges of being happy. And, as such, it's both an enjoyable comedy and a fascinating character study.WWPD%u2014What Would Poppy Do?It was a film The Secret would want me to see.Poppy, memorably played by Sally Hawkins, is one of those individuals who sees every glass as half-full.Happy-Go-Lucky ultimately charms -- just like its dizzy, disarming heroine.No list of the year's best performances should be made without [Sally Hawkins].A picture so seemingly light that it might be hours (or even days) before you realize how deep and rich it really is.As surprising as it is delicious with an indelible performance by new star Sally Hawkins.As usual, Leigh's trademark extended rehearsal process pays off with vivid characterizations from ensemble cast.Sally Hawkins' enchanting performance is yet another example that Leigh's trademark technique is working.Leigh finally discovers the entire other half of human experience that he's always ignored, and in the process directs his best film since Secrets & Lies.For the most part, the British comedy-drama Happy-Go-Lucky lives up to its title....the rare movie that seems better the more you think about it.se taksideyei me aksiozileyti anesi kai finetsa, se mia eidylliaka fantasiaki ensarkosi tis endedeigmenis antidrasis ki antistasis toy anthropoy, apenanti sta mayra synnefa tis Morntor poy skepazoyn ti zoi toyThat smile is so winning it's almost transcendent (kind of like Julia Roberts' smile, back when she used to smile). But it's Hawkins' depth that ultimately sells the film's premise.In this bleak economic climate, are you looking for a glass that's half-full instead of half-empty? Here's a lighthearted, life-affirming comedy to be thankful for.One of Leigh's most upbeat films, as well as one of the best.Here's what makes Mike Leigh's films so good: We expect, since we're watching a movie, that we'll eventually see the other side of these characters.Hawkins wears her grin in almost every scene, but she gives us hints that this dizzy 30-year-old is deep, as are the disappointments that might have caused Poppy to don this mask. It's a performance of sustained, childlike wonder and adult wit.Cheerleaders for melancholy have often linked it with profundity. But it's Leigh's achievement to show that happiness, too, can have its depths, and even its darkness.What it's ultimately about isn't Poppy's unflagging cheerfulness, but about how she uses her cheerfulness to cling on to an increasingly precious commodity: hope.Roguishly insightful and quietly riveting, Happy-Go-Lucky is innocuously entertaining in its free-wheeling spirit...methodically merry-minded and meaningful...An upbeat seriocomedy about an ever-smiling eternal optimist.A winning character study by the king of chronicling the British working-class, Mike Leigh.Mike Leigh seems to have had a great time writing about this woman who uses her sunny attitude as armor against life and more surprisingly finds that it works for her.Scenes that would be throwaways in most films -- girls gabbing on their night out, a walk by the seaside -- have been set up to tell us a lot about the people in them, if we'll only pay close attention.Any character who bears even a slight resemblance to Robin Williams' insufferable Patch Adams deserves no less a fate than being simultaneously electrocuted and beheaded at film's end, yet here's writer-director Mike Leigh bucking some formidable odds.And, boy, do you pull for her, because if the indomitable Poppy can't find what she's looking for, then there's no hope for the rest of us.Poppy is not a contradiction of but an artistic first cousin to Leigh's previous heroine, Vera Drake; both are open, fearless, unselfish and compassionate women, trying to craft the best life possible out of the potentially dreary material of existence.",

        "document": "A diverting study in the rolling disaster of adolescence, gathering speed and danger as it goes.The strength of the movie -- which makes sure to show the pressures its characters face, so that all of them are weak but none of them is a villain -- is its recognition of the strength within Meg.It's that central dance between teacher and student that makes the movie both hard to watch and worth your attention -- a subtle waltz of power in which it's difficult to tell who's leading until too late.The story is so well-acted and honestly written that after a while it stops bothering us that we know where it's going.We've seen this unhappy scenario played out many times before, but seldom with a better eye for detail.The film is strengthened by the two leading performances.It's rare that a movie makes a viewer experience the psychodynamics of an encounter so profoundly -- usually theater is a better medium for that -- but Moncrieff has exceptional skills.Certainly no feel-good flick of the summer. But it's always tough and honest.Even with its drawbacks, Blue Car remains an intimate, thoughtful drama, with a performance no one is likely to forget.Has the feel of a novel in which the characters linger in one's memory well after the book has been read.A quietly devastating song for our lonely age.Intimate, honest, if occasionally contrived.It's a writer-director's important debut and a giant leap to leading roles for a brave actress.Incorporates every stereotype of 'sensitivity' and 'angst' without ever approaching a genuine emotion.Strathairn's portrayal of a flawed man is so moving and Bruckner's Meg so painfully true -- a breakthrough performance -- that thoughts of Lolita are left far behind.Blue Car is a beautifully crafted and well-acted drama about the tug and pull of yearning in the lives of a tormented young eighteen-year-old poet and her high school English teacher.It's rare that a first-time director demonstrates such a sure hand, but Moncrieff is the real deal.One of the rare female coming-of-age stories in which the overall sense of authenticity more than compensates for the narrative lapses.No mere run-of-the-mill coming of age tale but a complex, poignant drama of a teacher-student relationship exquisitely acted.Thanks to Bruckner and Strathairn, who's queasy beyond the call of duty, this is one indie that resonates well beyond the end credits....perhaps slight of budget but full of heart, soul, and a ton of acting talent, all well stirred by a new director who has expertly transferred her story of family failures and teen dreams to the big screen.Moody, thoughtful drama is a brilliant debut for new actress Agnes Bruckner and a triumph for veteran David Strathairn.The movie unfolds, wobbling between scenes that feel fresh and genuine and others that feel seriously overfreighted with ethical judgments.A convincing piece of drama that makes teen angst look like a perfectly reasonable reaction to events.A valuable cautionary tale.... this film is so smart ...The movie crams a hell of a lot of dysfunction into its 88 minutes . . . Rare are the movies that convincingly depict a small child going mad.A beautifully crafted and painfully sincere movie that makes most dramas about teenagers seem about as real and relevant as American Pie.For the most part, Blue Car succeeds in fulfilling Meg's assignment to 'touch the hidden nerve.'The performances here top-notch across the board.Handles a difficult subject with an admirable mixture of sensitivity and frankness.A teacher-student tangle that uses its So-Called Lifeness as a beard for interactions that veer from everyday surreal to hauntingly injurious.Its refusal to come alive as a film, rather than just a good piece of writing, ultimately strands its good intentions.A coming-of-age tale acted with such honesty, and directed with such quiet understanding of its troubled characters, that its nearly unrelenting grimness takes on a poetic quality.From the rain-streaked windshield to the unaffected line readings from a stellar cast, there is not a shot in Blue Car that doesn't ring true.As bitterness piles upon disappointment piles upon loneliness, Blue Car stalls under the weight of its emotional baggage.I didn't like Blue Car, and the only thing I found appalling is how blatantly predicable and pseudo-daring the supposedly appalling stuff is.An affecting look at one talented girl's efforts to survive in a world of confused and selfish adults.A well-intentioned coming-of-age film anchored by two indelible performances but weakened by an overabundance of drama.Blue Car isn't an easy ride, but it's worth taking.Easily my favorite American independent movie since You Can Count on Me.Moncrieff (who studied acting) has such a fine cast that she makes the nuances come together as the portrait of a brief, piercing time in peoples' lives.Worth watching for the coming-out party of Agnes Bruckner, a relative newcomer who shows her mettle with an extraordinary performance in this very ordinary tear-jerker.An impressive first effort from Ms. Moncrieff, but the eternal Aristotelian in me finds it depressing to watch characters always walking around in moral quicksand.Karen Moncrieff's evocation of the awkward, clashing relationships... and her clear-eyed look at the idealization of an inspirational teacher by a student in need of a daddy have an unsettlingly honest feel.Blue Car boasts great talent in Bruckner, Straithairn and Moncrieff... [but] that talent isn't enough to get over the obstacles in the movie's second half.borrows heavily from her television soap experience but doesn't collapse totally into the banal...leaves Strathairn's possible predator frustratingly out of focus.Moncrieff unfolds the tale with the bare-bones grace of an expert novelist, making subtle connections but never telling the audience how to feel.Sad, spare coming-of-age story.A cozy, well-made vehicle without the capacity to carry everything that writer-director Karen Moncrieff piles into it.The false notes at the beginning give way to a darkly satisfying coming-of-age drama, capped by a truly cathartic poetry reading.Story provides such a poignant and believable characterization of Meg that it easily touches your heart.In its studied, naturalistic way, the movie can nonetheless resemble a week of Oprah sobfests.Blue Car may not be in the category of a classic, but it's certainly not a total wreck (more like a fixer-upper that's serviceable).This film is ultimately disappointing if not only for the lack of originality in the final scenes.Strathairn works miracles by finding the humanity in a deeply flawed man. And Bruckner is an amazement, piercing the heart without begging for sympathy.Moncrieff offers a rare, unromantic take on female adolescence as sharp as a razor: It cuts right to the bone.Ms. Moncrieff's low-key directing is matched by fine acting from Agnes Bruckner as Meg and David Strathairn as her mentor.There's nothing particularly original about the plotline, but the execution is pretty good and may be enough to keep you in your seat.The film raises predictability to new levels.If three-dimensional characters, a well-rounded screenplay, doomed love and dramatic insight 'do it' for you, this film is sure to stimulate.Not unlike Robert J. Siegel's Swimming, this little gem plays out an awful lot like adolescence.[Blue Car contains] a fantastic (and most likely star-making) performance by Agnes Bruckner and a script that never strikes a false or phony note.A most impressive writing and directing debut for Karen Moncrieff.A fine first film, and one you won't easily forget.When Meg looks mournfully over a box of scattered pictures (lighting the corners of her mind, no doubt), Blue Car, already maudlin, suddenly and terrifyingly becomes Purple Rain.A moody, almost somnolent film in which good performances outweigh the oppressive subject matter.An unflinchingly honest coming-of-age portrait.It's an incredibly strong debut reinforced by astonishingly good performances by all the principals.An overtly earnest, mopey first feature.Painful to watch, yet it never sinks to melodrama.Moncrieff grabs us with details and dialogue so authentic ... that she often makes us feel as if we're standing on our toes and peering in the window of one of our neighbors.Ms. Moncrieff's mature direction distills nuanced performances from her actors to tell a well-balanced, compelling and enlightening story with refreshing candor.Vivid performances . . . the film's warmly luminous look and the richly rendered view of a troubled but talented teen's struggles with the adult world sustain the film.Cuts both ways: the poetry and the acting were hot, the story and the cinematography were not so hot....falters because it hews too closely to the witless cant of the average guy as a potential sex criminal.Though the story is fragile, Bruckner's superlative acting registers Meg's feelings with the dead-on accuracy of an emotional geiger counter.Moncrieff, though seemingly incapable of lacing a story with surprises, writes snappy dialogue.The truest depiction I have ever seen on film of how children grow up with divorced parents. Hollywood blockbuster hype notwithstanding, this is actually the must-see movie of the summer.I found this movie fascinating -- but not an easy one to sit through. It's seems excruciatingly real.At the film's center Bruckner more than holds her own, beautifully capturing the anger, uncertainty and yearnings of an unhappy kid impatient for her 'real' life to begin.",

        "document": "An alternate and superior British version of Rounders with elements of Reindeer Games and hilariously unnecessary voiceover narration thrown in.Clive Owen conveys a sharp, cynical intelligence that rolls off the screen in waves whenever he widens his glittering blue eyes.The choice of Clive Owen as the star is a good one. He's got the same sort of physical reserve as Sean Connery in the Bond pictures.With its fascinating, multi-layered plot, intelligent screenplay, and subtle-yet-undeniable tension building, Croupier is an engrossing, stylish thriller that never threatens to wear out its welcome.Actor Clive Owen proves to be powerfully unflappable -- a working-stiff James Bond, whose understated intensity draws you into the movie and refuses to let you leave.Don't let Croupier go by without a look.Seldom will you see a film so well crafted, and you will likely go a long way to find performances even half this good, especially Owen's and McKee's.Owen is superb.Stylish but cold.Croupier also offers an intriguing look at the writing process and the allure of writing, which in part is the ability to pull strings.Not since 1971's Get Carter has British director Mike Hodges made a movie as deep, dark and compelling as this thriller.Wonderfully wry and suspenseful.It's a real surprise to watch Hodges examine the humanity of his characters instead of just having them run around and kill each other.Croupier is taut, tense and enthralling, as smart and surprising as its protagonist.It's more of an art movie than a thriller, but it's still gripping, persuasive, unsettling stuff.For once here is a British film that is both tough and intelligent, and so well-researched that it will probably tell you more about how casinos work than had it been a documentary....a model of what might be accomplished by a capable director working on a small budget - namely one of the best films of the year.One of the very best movies of this beloved and sleazy genre.For refusing to lie down and let his film die and for returning some much needed cred to British cinema, Hodges deserves another roll of the dice.Clive Owen's breakthrough roleUltimately, it's the finely drawn characters, the unusual setting and a completely engrossing story that make this one a winner.Far more successful at the gambler's rush than Matt Damon's schoolboy lessons in Rounders, Croupier is worth taking a chance on.Croupier is a stylish, riveting dramatic crime story, loaded to the gills with subtext, character development, and plot twists you'll be puzzling over all night.A spare, seductive, almost novelistic suspense drama.One of the most exciting discoveries of the 2000 Floating Film Festival.It's a testimony to how well Croupier works for 90% of its running time that the train wreck of a conclusion can't derail the whole film.Croupier is a thriller without car chases or explosions which works as an intense, swiftly-paced winner.This is an overlooked noir thriller...It's amazing the level of suspense that Hodges builds as Jack/Jake intermingles with other people.Clive Owen is like man heroin...he gets into your blood and gets addictive!A quite satisfying examination of a man caught between his need to feel and his fear of feeling too much.Viewers who stick with it will be rewarded, not only by Owen's masterful turn, but by Hodges' prickly, not-quite-a-surprise ending.As for director Hodges, he has made a thinking man's thriller that comes up aces.For 95 percent of the way, it is an engrossing tour of an attractively seamy side of life and a fascinating character study, despite having a novelist for a hero.Airless, mannered mess.It's very cool. It's only kind of good.Clive Owen impresses in this monochromatic card-sharp drama.With a sleek look and feel, the movie has stylish atmospherics and a detached approach that is a far cry from the typical in-your-face Hollywood production.A pleasant surprise.The real star of Croupier is Hodges, whose ability to create gripping tension and icy humor makes every second of his film infectiously watchable.Polished and adroit ado about next to nothing, Hodges's film owes everything to Owen, who nails the vaguely unsavory, unreadable, half-lidded hunks that inhabit every profitable entertainment-industry outpost.Gambling and gamblers are a movie staple, but Croupier comes at the sport and its population from a fresh and, finally, rewardingly wide perspective.",

        "document": "The film never manages to build into the clever comedy it initially seems destined to be.I was never engaged in the film's story nor did I care about its main character.It simply lacks the kind of audacity, confidence and substance that was the hallmark of Kasdan's best work in the '80s.It's hard to tell what drew Kasdan to imagine Mumford - the town and the man - since the flimsily whimsical, rambling result never declares its intentions.There are cute moments and some very nice performances. All that's missing is a movie.Neither funny, heart-warming nor star-powered enough to motivate the public to turn out in very large numbers.This pleasant romantic fantasy is slight enough to go straight to cable -- to network, even.Simply a nice film. But that's not as much of a compliment as it sounds.Mumford is such an instantly forgettable piece of work.Mumford doesn't go very far or deep in detailing our impostor's road to redemption.The performances are disarming and Mumford is the kind of comedy that grows on you if you give it a chance.Writer-director Kasdan has a nice way with his oddball crew.Mumford is so carefully visualized in Lawrence Kasdan's new film that you'd sort of like to live there.Mumford is a movie full of insightful moments, and some of them are even pure therapy.After watching Mumford, I not only felt a little better, I was downright happy.A restful, realistic remedy for the past summer's wild ride....a sweet fable that reminds one of the work of Frank Capra or Preston Sturges.Not to be mistaken for any movie that has a gun in it.Kasdan makes good use of all the actors involved, and each one hits the right note -- Dean, Davis and Lee are particularly good.The great performance comes from Davis who - not surprisingly - takes an increasing amount of Mumford's attention.Mumford is agreeably entertaining, peppered with rich laughs and very nice actorly touches.The film is quite well acted, notably by Dean.It's witty, entertaining, often funny as hell and even, at times, surprisingly wise about the human condition.It turns the tricks of psychology into duplicitous high play.This film is smart, but also entertaining -- made to go with popcorn, a cola and, well, Prozac.Director Lawrence Kasdan's Mumford blends likable characters with a humorous, gentle look at small town life.An excellent ensemble effort.It's a cozy film with fun characters, fine dialogue and an inspiringly warm and fuzzy theme.Humongously entertaining.This eccentric fairy tale with the feel of Our Town has a number of remarkable performances, chiefly those of Loren Dean.Hope Davis deserves much of credit for making Mumford work.Kasdan's new comedy, Mumford, is so wonderfully odd, even spiritual, that audiences won't be able to do anything but smile.Some viewers may find themselves bored, confused and turned off, especially in the first half.An intellectually vacant and pointless excursion to a town that is almost frightening in its artificiality.There is a curious absence of development in this film.Kasdan fans are better off renting Body Heat.There was nothing fantastic about this fantasy film, not even the fantasy.Not even the master mirthmaker in Kasdan can save Dean or Mumford from bouts of mediocrity.Let's see, no stars, little action, but a fine little script. Hey, don't they call that a 'play?'Imperfect.Veteran writer-director Lawrence Kasdan knows his film history.After so many gross offenses committed in the name of comedy lately, here's a film whose humor rests on the audacious assumption that you, the moviegoer, have a brain.Clever dialogue.A satisfying feel-good experience that challenges, the film affords us the opportunities to self-examine and laugh openly, and often simultaneously.A likable semi-screwball comedy.A movie filled with gems!The Mumford character requires an actor who doesn't try too hard, and Loren Dean doesn't.Somewhere in the middle, when we hear Mumford's real history, we stop laughing and we never start up again.Director Lawrence Kasdan's small-town fable beguiles.... it ends up being little more than a mellow tour of quirky characters that are better as representatives of different personality types than actual characters we believe in.Mumford may look okay on your television some dead afternoon, but it isn't a movie.Great characters, but for older teens and up.Continues Kasdan's slump into mediocrity.An endearing portrait of a wounded healer who uses his own experiences of pain and compulsivness to help others.Simple and sweet, but unforgivably trite.A film without conviction, about a town full of people with problems without depth, aided by a guru without soul.The performances are uneven.A frustrating, mundane piece of filmmaking that only serves to emphasize the spottiness of Kasdan's post-Body Heat output.",

        "document": "This is first-rate filmmaking, horrific and tender, raw and lyrical.It has an underlying warmth that elevates it to greatness.There aren't many films coming out of Hollywood that work on this many levels.The structure lacks purpose, the film struggles to justify its two-and-a-half-hour running time and the faint-hearted might find it a little gory.The production is first rate on all levels.The filmmakers offer little hope for these characters.\"Amores Perros\" is simply a great film.Nominated for an Oscar as best foreign-language film, it's a movie that's all over the lot (and interestingly so).In a single film, director Alejandro Gonz\u0440lez I\u044b\u0440rritu balances stories and moods as diverse as canine breeds.The occasional juxtaposition of human copulation and dog-on-dog violence makes for a pretty sophomoric metaphor. Otherwise, the movie's perception is on target.A tightly edited, wildly energetic paean to the trauma of relationships, between people and between people and their dogs.Seething, unsettling.Compels almost effortlessly, and skilfully conceals its thefts (from Tarantino, mostly), easy ironies, and insubstantiality.An extraordinary cinematic feat.It may not have won the Oscar, but this is ... an ambitious and thrilling work.Inarritu and his cast are able to make the audience care for these deeply flawed characters and share their often intertwined feelings of pleasure and pain.We end up completely fascinated with and at least partially caring about characters that otherwise would be decidedly less than sympathetic in any other situation.Give me Los Olvidados instead, but this pumped telenovela is very much the film Kieslowski would have made had he followed Bu\u044buel's lead and gone to Mexico.You will walk away reeling from the jolt to your senses.[Inarritu] may well be the millennium's first new master film maker.Please for the love of everything holy, go check this film out.Richly dramatic and resonates with complex emotions.A harrowing portrait.An eye-opening feat of technical prowess and storytelling.Stylishly gritty.an impressive film debutInventively restless and relentlessly potent.\"A compelling, savage breakthrough for Mexican cinema\"Embodies all the excitement we looked forward to after the dog days of Pulp Fiction.Has the patience to glean real emotions from surreal situations and the intelligence not to offer up fake closure.Definitely fierce and most definitely human.Divided into three chapters, pic is cunningly constructed and, until near the end, briskly paced.I\u044b\u0440rritu's characters are full of life and earthy flaws, and things that are too much for them to comprehend.The level of violence is so gratuitous and so disgusting that I picked up my coat several times and started to walk out, something I almost never do.Apart from the first story, the film just doesn't live up to its promise.Succumbs to the dangers of such a fractured narrative practice: too much bravado, not enough soul.Amores feels like the first classic of the new decade, with sequences that will probably make their way into history.In his eager passion to fill Amores Perros with explosive imagery, I\u044barritu nearly drowns his audience in visual excess.Amores would have been an amazing enough film, but learning it's Alejandro Gonz\u0440lez I\u044b\u0440rritu's directorial debut is a little like getting the wind knocked out of you.Amores Perros es una historia de amor sin mensajes moralistas o edificantes. Simplemente es una experiencia inolvidableFor its more earthy treatment of celestially-inspired repayment for our sins deserves serious consideration by the Academy.A harrowing, powerful and often disturbing movie about three seemingly unrelated stories that collide after one horrific car accident in Mexico City.It is that rarest of features that shows a deep understanding of people, truly cinematic storytelling technique and brilliantly choreographed fight and chase scenes.... it is a hyperviolent movie against violence; a graphic portrayal of infidelity in the name of marriage; a tale of murderous sibling rivalry in the name of family.Solidly engaging, supersized 2000 Mexican drama.Dozens of shoddy imitators have done nothing to disguise the wit of its narrative construction.Screenwriter Guillermo Arriaga and director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu exert such control over the story that even a cute doggie disappearance develops into a toilet-trained take on \"The Telltale Heart.\" Warts and all, \"Amores Perros\" is love, actually.Recalling Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction - but edgier than both - this is a hell of a first film. For all its bonecrunching savagery, it's also a fundamentally moral work.One of the most honored and most expertly articulated Mexican films of recent years.Gonzalez Inarritu's sinfully enjoyable epic roars in on a wave of blood, gunshots and dog barks.Amores Perros signals the bold, audacious, fiercely human and ultra-violent feature directorial debut of Inarritu, a gifted Mexican director bound to make a mark on international cinema.Energetic and powerful, Amores Perros captures the surreal culture clashes of Mexico City to the beat of contemporary sounds, from salsa to Mexican rock.Gonz\u0440lez I\u044b\u0440rritu spares no detail in his telling, creating an ambitious, starkly realistic movie that just happens to be way too long.Just keeps coming at you, switching characters, tones, and rhythms to keep you off-guard.Ferocious and beautiful.[The] sense that even hair-trigger lives, always poised on the edge of self-destructive lunacy, deserve to be sympathetically understood is Amores Perros' redeeming grace.For those willing to submit to its terrible charms, it may be the single most important debut to come out of the Americas in years.An invigorating film, without a doubt.You know you're in the hands of a gifted storyteller.It finds the human beauty that spills out of the knife wounds.Amores Perros is more than just a strong debut; it's good, gritty filmmaking.Has the feel of an instant classic, a melodrama with an exacting precision and a visceral, propulsive energy.Once seen, it's impossible to shake from the mind.The work of a born filmmaker.An exhilarating debut.Never fails to be smart, engaging, audacious and haunting.The raw, propulsive vigor of Inarritu's dances of death on the streets of Mexico City mark him as a director who's suddenly very much on the cinematic map.Ablaze with a raft of vital portrayals and rich in meaning and implication.The cinematic equivalent of a one-two gut punch. In a good way, that is.A film of tremendous complexity and depth, a galvanic force that sends the mind reeling.An overpowering and original piece of bravura filmmaking that constitutes one of the most breathtaking and impressive directing debuts in years.Often thrilling, if overwhelmingly brutal.A film with something to say and a remarkably adult understanding of human passion and the crazy places it leads us.A potent reminder that life is brutal and brief, and that bonds between people are much easier to sever than to tie.May be the most repellent great movie you will ever see.A fiercely brilliant film of such wrenching impact, nonstop drive and unpredictability that watching it becomes an exhilarating ride.Almost entirely a surface phenomenon, fascinating to look at but pretty empty beneath a raucously mesmerizing exterior.Six-degrees- of-separation has never felt so merciless and ironicI\u044barritu keeps us involved in at-times tune-outable material.A sophisticated, stylish, fast-moving piece of work.Though unflinching in its savagery, Amores Perros is always compulsive viewing.Inarritu's talent may be derivative, but it's applied to a setting he knows well and whose vibrancy he's keen to convey.Amores Perros es una cinta capaz de pegarnos intensamente en la mirada pero tambi\u0436n en el esp\u044critu.Directed with energy and ferocity by eye-opening newcomer Alejandro Gonzalez Innaritu.The biggest strength of Amores Perros is its display of humanity at its worst when it is driven by primal attachments.Fresh, shocking, violent, romantic, profane and profound, Amores Perros is a revelation, a jolt of cinematic power and a bracing act of faith.A good and extremely ambitious first effort.It's good and good-looking and features one of the best soundtracks in years ... but it's also slick and schematic, weak on feeling and overly indebted to Tarantino.Astonishingly powerful debut film from director Inarritu - brilliantly shot, superbly acted and deeply heartfelt, this is one of the best films of the year.It is a raw, intermittently brilliant film that heralds a sort of renaissance in Mexican film.Seemingly uneven, Questionably overlong, Indisputably intriguingAmores Perros (Love's a Bitch) is a great new film from Mexico that proves that somebody, somewhere, is still making upsetting, enthralling movies.This searing Mexican film depicts the toxicity of human betrayal.A strange range of humanity that, if nothing else, provides some much-needed alternatives to typical Mexican stereotypes.Always clever, and devastating in its depiction of human nature.A head-on hit -- and a tasty treat for lovers of Tarantino-style feasts of fine visual excess.Fierce, loving, and electric, this movie's got bite as well as bark.It's worth a trip to the arthouse ... that is, if you have a strong stomach.A truly stunning film, both horrible and beautiful.Punishingly overlong.Cannily balances the melodrama with starkly naturalistic detail.A stunningly made film, raw and authentic, with the ability to get way under the skin.First-time director Alejandro Gonz\u0440lez I\u044b\u0440rritu has taken an original story and fashioned it into a tale that is gritty, multifaceted, and brimming with edgy performances.The stories never come together in a way that really enlightens, but that's not to say the film is anything less than entertaining.Even with its flaws, it will be hard to find a film with as many complex characters inhabiting its world as this.It's a truly prodigious piece of work, resembling a career summation far more than a maiden voyage.The performances here are, again and again, natural and convincing, with many of the actors making their debuts.Grabs our attention... Innaritu is a clever visual stylist.Filmmaker Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu conveys an urgency and a compassion that ultimately make this grim picture strangely uplifting.An ambitious multi-plotted portrait of overlapping lives in contemporary Mexico City, Amores perros rarely relaxes its grip.One of the more exhilarating movie thrillers of late.",

        "document": "Is this movie just an excuse to film a bunch of people having sex? As far as I'm concerned, yup.What makes Shortbus unusual for an American movie is that it isn't frightened of sex, it doesn't reduce the act to insensitive frat boy gyrations, and it doesn't employ it as a bludgeoning weapon.A film that's thoughtful and exuberant, achingly sad and wildly funny.... in the end it will be remembered for proving that the most important sexual organ is the brain.A movie that's not quite porn enough for the skin-flick fans and not substantial enough for filmgoers who seek a film that somehow combines sex, heart and intelligence.Rises above late-night basic cable trash thanks to the courageous cast and Mitchell's accomplished direction.Few arthouse directors have put real sex to such narratively constructive and credibly, humorously human use.I would like to commend Mitchell for making a warm, funny and very human film about people who don't just want sex but want to enjoy sex with someone they love. What a concept!Wearing its controversy-courting eagerness to shock on its sleeve, the film aims to challenge taboos, but comes up short.The explicit sexual content may be too extreme for some but this is a thoroughly enjoyable, frequently hilarious romcom that deserves to be seen.The kind of film that keeps Rick Santorum up at night....the end result [is] a movie that has little to offer all but the most avant garde viewer.Simply brilliant.The sex is repetitious, leaving little to the imagintion.The graphic sex is certainly inventive and enthusiastic but fails to shed much light on character.Walking a fine line between high camp and serious dissection of sexual mores of New York's hip crowd, straight and gay, Shortbus is a sexually explicit film that reflects Mitchell's determination to break taboos.Mitchell, despite appearances, is more interested in what makes his characters tick rather than their physical peccadilloes.Playfully and provocatively entertaining for roughly the first half, but loses staying power thereafter when investment in the uncompelling characters' problems is requested.Its sexual provocations aside, the film works best as an idealized portrait of a specific time and place, a hipster bohemia where everyone struggles to find meaning in the everyday acts of living.It's a grand ambition, only partially realized. But watching Mitchell try makes for an exhilarating trip.More than a stunt...a sincere film that explores cynical sexual discord and hopefully concludes that forgiveness and sexual healing can repair the disrupted currents of modern urban life.I can't believe that the same person who wrote and directed the brilliant \"Hedwig and the Angry Inch\" made the ludicrously bad \"Shortbus\".[Shortbus] spends a lot of time in those messy gray areas, discovering how sex can clear things up or make them cloudierPorn is porn, even if it's somewhat artistic.If the brush strokes are sometimes a bit sloppy, the grand design of Shortbus endears.If Mitchell's attempt was to bring moments like this to the mainstream of nonchalant intimacy, he fails since the sex scenes have the atmosphere of exhibitionism more than an expression of love or feeling.Not surprisingly, the graphic sex on display in Shortbus has eclipsed all other considerations, including the fact that it's a fairly interesting movie.Mitchell adds his quirky auteur touch (most notably with a series of 3-D animated cityscapes that look almost handmade), and the result is eminently more satisfying.Shortbus doesn't quite delve as deeply as it ought into its characters' emotions: It has more breadth than depth, perhaps due to its improvisational methods.It runs out of energy before the end.full review in GreekAnother telling example (\"The Brown Bunny,\" \"Anatomy of Hell,\" Bellocchio's \"Devil in the Flesh\") that hardcore sex seems better suited to hardcore sex films.This is a film for the adventurous. A colourful and wondrously imaginative sexual adventure that integrates humour, symbolism and emotionDespite the movie's matter-of-fact approach to (and depiction of) graphic acts, the point isn't the sex, it's the genuine emotion generated by the actors, who helped develop their roles with Mitchell.You know something is amiss when the spiky-haired dominatrix is a more relatable character than the movie's ostensible leading lady.Simply a terrific movie -- the most courageous (not just because of the sex), inventive, moving and captivating film I've seen this year.One woman's quest for the perfect orgasm may strike sophisticated viewers as the stuff of sexual farce at best, but Sook-Yin Lee's Sofia brings both emotion and eroticism to the proceedings, and for this Mr. Mitchell should be commended.[Shortbus] will give adults who aren't put off by zoo-naked sex more to talk about, even in disparagement, than anything showing at the Cineplex.I must admit I found Shortbus to be an unsuccessful hybrid -- effective neither as porn (it's often strangely unerotic) nor as art or storytelling.Despite the buzz about its hard-core hanky-panky, writer-director John Cameron Mitchell paints a bland, bleak portrait of navel-gazing New Yorkers driven by carnal pleasures -- or lack of them.A wild, surging burlesque of free-flowing sexuality you're more likely to see on the Internet than in a movie theater.It's actually a rather sweet and sharply funny ode to sexual liberation, and I suppose it wouldn't make sense that a film celebrating the freedom for consenting adults to say \"yes\" would say \"no\" to showing it.The premise of this story is pretty fascinating but it seems that it gets diluted, not enhanced by the sheer amount of sex. I would be fakin' it if I recommended this movie.Suffers from a vague, ad lib-y script and a cast that, while hardly shy, isn't exactly charismatic.There's no real prurience or eroticism, but the movie does have an aura of self-gratification...Offers poignant and comedic insight into sex and relationships through some very honest, forthright performances.Mitchell's gift as a filmmaker is to take people who seem way out and show us they're actually looking for the same things we all are.At a time when American moviegoers have become numb to the rampant, mainstream pornography of violence, it's refreshing to see a non-mainstream movie that wears its heart and lust on its sleeve, and has anything but violence on its mind.Surprisingly sweet and unabashedly graphic.Indulgent, immature, self-preoccupied and downright silly a good deal of the time, Shortbus manages to make sex look like no fun at all.Obviously, Shortbus isn't for everyone. But adventurous filmgoers will find here an entertaining, funny and, yes, moral look at sex, love and all the stops in between.Shortbus' surprisingly sweet, compassionate tone never flags, helping the movie overcome its own flaws.Shortbus feels uninhibited but uninhabited, a clinical schematic exercise in the intercourse of human events.The actors, while physically supple, can't draw us through Mitchell's sketchy script.Shortbus strains at times with its acrobatic, real sex and search for bigger meanings. But beneath those elements lies a kind, open heart.Lancingly funny, brash and alive, this hotsie-totsie peeper aches for love, and the gay fire of pre-AIDs partydom.A rather sweet, wistful little movie that just happens to have a lot of explicit sex in it.Gets points for originality of design, but as is often the case with scripts written by committee, the execution is dramatically uninteresting.The characters' lack of any real substance--it's really only all about attitude--make one gradually lose interest until the next in flagrante delicto moment.a project that has brains as well as bravado. It's also very funny, which helps to diffuse much of the nervousness that its graphic sex scenes might inspire in viewers. ...an imaginative, involving and ultimately touching story.Incredibly sexy without being titilating, this is a very well crafted flick that deserves a bigger audience than it will inevitably receive.Fetishists are people, too!Shortbus flips through varying moods with overall success, fleshing out the characters who show flesh.There may be a variety of erotic practices on parade here, but the film leaves viewers with few real insights into either human nature or sexuality.Director John Cameron Mitchell (\"Hedwig and The Angry Inch\") flaunts cinematic tradition with a raucous sex comedy filled with truly shocking sex acts that underscore his vision of New York as a playground of debauchery.Shortbus is not, above all, 'dirty.' What it is, in fact, is a nice movie, one of the nicest to come down the pike since March of the Penguins.This isn't an exploit into pornographic ideals, but a movie with genuine ideas that are completely freed from political correctness.Genuinely enliveningWell-stocked with witty lines, funny situations and credible, intelligent character insights.As the loving story unfolds in the second and third acts, you realize that no mere porno would ever go this far into the emotional realm of its copulating couples.Shortbus is sexually explicit, yes, but it is more about the people portrayed and how they cope with their ever-changing lives as they find themselves.On its own, the movie feels, while engaging, provocative and hugely watchable (and you'll have to trust me on this, not simply because of its genuinely daring sex scenes) also slightly tentative and vague.Shortbus is very funny, and quite moving at times. There are some neat low-budget stylistic touches as well.All manners of sexual behavior ultimately detract from a poignant message about the slim and subtle connections between physical and emotional love.The reality of the film is that it's just an obvious and tedious melodrama about lovers negotiating the minefields of emotion and sex, and not quite connecting.If [Mitchell's] goal was to integrate actual sex into fictional characters' lives in ways that are not distracting, a reality check is in order.A sweet, very funny, volcanically romantic comedy-drama about relationships in post-9/11 New York City.The film proves that nudity and unbridled sexuality alone are not enough to entertain.Yes, Shortbus is all about hooking up, but in emotional as much as sexual ways. That's what makes the movie engaging, and sometimes even moving.The premise -- a roundelay of New Yorkers looking for connection, or to escape it -- feels tired.Don't try this at home.A fun ride with a satisfying finish. Appropriately enough.I kid you not, 'heartwarming' is the best word to describe it.It would have helped had the characters in Shortbus been a little more interesting than the sexual positions in which they frequently find themselves entangled.[Mitchell] reclaims sex -- filming it, watching it, talking about it, doing it -- as something both deeply funny and transcendently human: a revolving door that leads to the senses and to the heart.It's more than a porno movie with a plot. The reality of the heart manages to always temper the allure of the flesh. Ultimately, Mr. Mitchell shows us that sex doesn't mean a whole lot without a deeper connection....the largest and most impressive organ on display in Shortbus is the movie's heart.Rankly sentimental...though the prudish should definitely steer clear, what ultimately derails Shortbus is that it's actually far less daring than it pretends to be.Bajo la piel de una pel%uFFFDcula sexualmente muy expl%uFFFDcita hay un delicado y sensible estudio de personajes, sus relaciones, sus frustraciones, y una irreverente y fresca mirada a la Nueva York pos-11 de setiembre.The hallmarks of a true collaboration between the director and his actors are everywhere, and their performances are what raise the film above any of its shortcomings.If you want to explore the ideas of love and emotional permeability while seeing a narratively complex world of sexual self-exploration to which few are privy, then this is the movie for you. Otherwise, run for your life.Sex and the self-centered.Mitchell worked with his cast to develop the various stories and the improvisatory effort may not have resulted in a Mike Leigh sort of drama but it has yielded wondrous moments. The cast is very good with the best performances coming from Lee as Sofia (wUm raro exemplo de produ\u0437\u0433o norte-americana que encara o sexo com maturidade, o filme \u0439 um estudo de personagens com sucesso apenas moderado, j\u0431 que n\u0433o consegue desenvolver todas as subtramas com o mesmo cuidado ou interesse.Oozes hardly more than body fluids in its telling tale.Everything comes to a head in a touchy-feely climax (if you catch our drift) where, ironically, it isn't the strong sex but all the singing and handholding that's the real turn-off.A gleefully subversive but over-simplistic rude little indie that's starting to gain cult status.Everybody has a right to pursue what makes them happy, so long as they don't hurt anyone else in the process. That's a sweet notion, but not a particularly deep one. The movie's all skin and heart; very little brain.The whole experience is enough to make one give thanks for the missionary position, and heterosexual complacency in surely not the reaction Shortbus was looking for.Mitchell uses a dubious but vividly aestheticized tableau of New York City to sweep in and out of the lives of characters whose problems are so weakly articulated they hardly inspire sympathy.The movie is so open about sex, and approaches it with such affectionate bewilderment, that it feels like an anomaly in our so-called sex-obsessed culture: I've felt sleazier looking at ads for Captain Morgan's rum.[Mitchell's] greatest innovation may be stripping on-screen sex of its heavy symbolic freight and letting it be as silly, serious, intense or detached as the people having it.John Cameron Mitchell's ode to the joy and sweet release of sex also manages to be a sincere, modest political venture that finds humor where you might least expect it.positively orgasmicAs with Brokeback Mountain, though, it's not the sexual content that seems revolutionary; it's the mainstream friendliness.Following Mitchell's delightful 2001 rock musical Hedwig and the Angry Inch, the director's Shortbus is another marvelous mix of very adult, very overt themes and images coupled with a sense of childlike innocence and awe.Never amounts to more than a case of hardcore triviality.Shortbus has the potential to become one of the films that redefine audience expectations, a watershed that divides other movies with similar themes into before and after. It's that good.Shortbus is perhaps the most wittily and gleefully performed feature film to contain actual sex scenes.Mitchell's energy and occasional ingenuity make Shortbus an engaging viewing experience, provided you can stomach it.On one hand... [Shortbus] is a libertine's dream; on the other, it's a deliriously moral film.The boldest provocation of Mitchell's sweet, tender and gently funny film may be its exuberant celebration of community and togetherness at a cultural moment rife with fatalism and disconnect.Mitchell has stated that his goal with Shortbus was to make a serious film that incorporates hardcore material. To an extent, he has done that. The problem is it's not a good movie.It's not art, it's not shocking and worst of all, it's not even particularly new.[Shortbus] takes place in a fantasy New York [...] between two temporal landmarks: September 11, 2001, and the blackout of 2003 [...] through brownouts and breakdowns, Mitchell posits a place of healing and humor and light and lots and lots of sex.Shortbus is chipper, it's fresh, it emits a distinct musk of controversy. I'll take the longbus.While it may not be the tour de force of Mitchell's directing debut (Hedwig and the Angry Inch), this risky project is still a lot of fun.Prozac porn.",

        "document": "Without a doubt, the animation is vibrant and electrifying; it's only the story that lacks.I sat there in stone silent disbelief, wondering what the studio thought they were doing.It is truly a film for the entire family and a portend of the road the new Dreamworks studio is creating.The casting is priceless and something any adult will appreciate.Antz works best just showing off its prodigious voice talent and playing lightheartedly with the curious possibilities of a buggy world.A delight, loaded with wit, style and charm.Thank goodness the seven-year-old in the theater seats won't have a clue about the dialogue. What would happen if they gave Z a chance and refused to comply with everything their mommies and daddies want them (for their own good, of course) to do?It is hipper and funnier than anything Disney has put out for years.My only complaint: the ants inexplicably look like they've been carved out of wood instead of looking real.Antz takes a huge step forward for computer animation!Antz crawling with detail, humor, Woody Allen style.The computer animation is first rate and filled with the kind of \"Wow! Look at that!\" wizardry that is eventually going to make Toy Story look about as technically sophisticated as South Park.The voice acting is excellent!Charming, Fun!It's a weird thrill to hear Allen's kvetching schtick without having to look at his increasingly saggy, pathetic face.There are still moviegoers who dream of seeing Woody Allen in a comedy like his early ones 'when they were funny.' Well, the film is here, but no one expected it would be.It's fresh, exhilarating, funny, able to tell an old story in a beguiling new way!Distinctive, delightful!Dreamworks SKG's first stab at animation is good enough to make Mickey Mouse proud.Kids may be puzzled by rebellious worker ants chanting Marxist slogans, but their parental guides may welcome the relief from the prevailing blandness of family films.This computer-animated comedy is much smarter than you'd be led to believe.Ultimately, it is difficult to mine warmth from a story about an ant colony; worse, the only real guffaws come from Allen doing Allen.It's a well-written, witty tale, expertly executed!Antz is about the relief felt by star actors freed from the constraints of their physical selves and the egos that go with them.This fully computer-animated feature with a phenomenal voice cast delivers a pleasurable 83 minutes of fantasy.A marvelously crafted, technologically amazing and downright fun tale!That's Ant-ertainment!The script, although a little too short (bringing the film to about an hour and 20 minutes, more or less), is sharp and witty, and the story really works.Antz is a dazzling, witty tale that will appeal to children and adults alike.Amusing and inventive.Has a smart script that will keep adults equally as entertained, if not more, as the young 'uns.This is an undeniably unique motion picture.HormiguitaZ es un claro ejemplo de lo que va a tener que luchar Disney para mantener su estatus de excelenciaAntz is crawling -- you'll excuse the pun -- with classic movie comedy.Antz is, quite simply, a delight....A spectacular computer-animated cartoon that is sure to give Disney's upcoming A Bug's Life a run for its sugar grains.There's plenty of action in this computer-animated comedy, but it's no match for Toy Story in humor and originality.How often have you been happy to find ants marching in your own back yard? This may mark the one and only time.Star-studded, gloriously animated, beautifully written, this cartoon will appeal just as much, if not more, to adults as to children.More story, less silly antics. Maybe then I'll be inclined to put down my can of Raid.A Woody Allen movie, with all the adult laughs, esteem issues and other accouterments that come with it, and a great kiddie flick, complete with the requisite warm and fuzzy character-building lessons.A few chuckles here and there, and a semi-interesting story line, but nothing too outstanding....the message of Antz is this: Freedom of choice is important, but one should use their freedom to be decent, responsible, humble, and helpful.The philosophical debates that centre the film are rather complex for little ones, but give us older ones something to talk about.A film of small, transient pleasures, diminished slightly by the clunkiness with which it wields it pat, Disney-esque self-determination moral.Truly one of the most extraordinary visual achievements in film history.Allen provides plenty of comic relief, and the computer-generated animation is pretty impressive.It enters into a microscopic world and makes it into a world so vast and threatening that comparisons with Star Wars are not unjustified!The kids will like it. You'll laugh.Visually, it's more impressive than Disney's Toy Story. On a script level, it was developed as much with a mature audience in mind as with the usual pre-pubescent crowd.A clever and appealing piece of work!The innovative animation is awesome!Antz is brief enough, clocking in at 83 minutes, but its story is too predictable to make an impact even in such a short space.A dazzling delight!...beautiful and visually appealing, but uninspired in the script department.Most live-action movies aren't this entertaining.The film breaks new ground in its dazzling re-creation of life from an ant's-eye view!In some ways this is Starship Troopers, as seen from the other side.An excellent piece of work!What really works is the dialogue, which is fast and funny and helps carry the action through the slow spots.A clever, funny, fascinating to watch film that could have been more.Succeeds at pushing the technology as well as and offering intelligent family fare that won't leave adults bored. Great fun.Has enough of a story to keep a child engaged and a script clever enough to keep an adult amused.The computer graphics in Antz are imaginative and remarkably detailed!By any standard, the film is a remarkable technical achievement.exciting, often hilarious and frequently wondrous film... Adults who live in fear of seeing non-Disney animated movies would be well-advised to overcome their prejudices.A Engaging and awe-inspiring animation once again elevates Shrek's world to fantastic heights, and the laughs are just as freewheeling as we have come to expect.Great effects, but surprisingly violent. Lacks kid appeal.Though the story is standard formula kids' fare, the Allen presence brings an adult swing to it, making it more than passable for both.Visually striking and dynamically shot, this has strong characters and no shortage of incident.Appeals to your daydreams when you were a kid and you wondered about the daily physical hassles of an ant.The artwork is spectacular, vocal performances uniformly capable and the jokes appealing to both adults and children.Uma formiga que deseja ter um pouco de individualidade? Puro Woody Allen.It's a perfect picnic, without the pesky human interference.This is actually one of the most clever and fun films I've seen in '98.The filmmakers seem to have deliberately snubbed the traditional audience for animated features.Hilarious stuff, superbly achieving that elusive goal of being entertaining kids fare and having a lot to offer the adults.The best thing about Antz, I'll say it right away, is Gene Hackman (General Mandible). Just for him, it's worth seeing Antz.Allen is certainly more lovable here than he has been in any of his own films for years, and he has delicious chemistry with the unlikely Stone and Stallone.The American myth of individualism as an antidote to conformity comes across loud and clear in Antz. Here freedom is glorified as the central virtue of life...a visually stunning film, embracing varied and sympathetic characters and a surprisingly coherent story.Antz is refreshingly naughty and nice.A kids' movie that will leave grown-ups quoting the best lines to one another.",

The devil is (quite literally) in the details.Then it comes, the make-or-break ending that had a theater full of teenagers on a Saturday night commenting on its stupidity. I joined them in spirit....precisely the sort of disposable trash horror film that we've come to expect at the end of the summer...Horror flick fans will struggle with the preacher, a camera guy and the producer sticking around as the possession gets more frightening and more violent. But that's horror.A nice little late-summer surprise, a horror film with a shred of intelligence and uncommonly good performances.a thoroughly enjoyable thrill ride, enough to keep you scared when you go home and try to go asleep with all the lights out and the house going bump in the nightDaniel Stamm's The Last Exorcism is one of the most interesting and accomplished horror debuts of the last few years.The Last Exorcism takes the best elements from 'The Exorcist' and 'The Blair Witch Project,' but the ending is scary for all the wrong reasons.Riddled with poor lighting, inappropriate use of music, and a plot you could fit in a tea cup, \"The Last Exorcism\" has all the appeal of a glorified, but poorly shot, student film.Self-possessed performances elevate this creepy but half-cocked faux-doc.Satan stalks the bible belt, as the occult locks horns so to speak, with free lance forensics, family dysfunction, and more sociopathic urges. And a not too hip Lucifer who thinks he's offering a doubting demon buster man of the cloth a 'blowing job.'Doesn't need any viral campaign. It's a good movie.It's hard to be frightened by something when you're too busy laughing at it.A smart horror film will fatten its pigs before the slaughter, and the mock doc The Last Exorcism feeds its prize hog nicely.With a small, well-chosen cast, sly script, and slippery, ambivalent characters, The Last Exorcism gives a welcome titty-twist to the demonic-possession movie revival.As taut and economical a horror film as I've seen in a long time...a gripping little movie that will give you the willies.The best thing about this film is the way it continually subverts our expectations.The Last Exorcism makes first-rate use of religious doubt and religious extremism to concoct a novel horror-thriller clever enough to seduce unbelievers while satisfying the bloodlust of its congregation/fanbase.A worthy addition to the horror climate.The movie loses points for being one of the later examples of a now-familiar genre, but it does have a highly charismatic flawed hero in Fabian's Cotton Marcus.For the most part, The Last Exorcism is an unconventional and fairly satisfying horror film.The Last Exorcism is as much a mystery about our faith in religion (and movies) as it is trying to make us squirm in our seats.The movie loses points for being one of the later examples of a now-familiar genre, but it does have a highly engaging and charismatic flawed hero, as well as a fine performance by television actor Patrick Fabian.The Last Exorcism refuses to conform to expectations by remaining ambiguous about the exact nature of the horror at hand instead of plunging straight into FX-laden freakiness.An unusually restrained and genuinely eerie little movie perched at the intersection of faith, folklore and female puberty.The film is like enjoying a beautifully tender filet mignon where every bite is delicious. But, at the end you find a disgusting fungus-filled toe nail on the plate.It's fun and it will have you jumping out of your underpants.Stamm creates an anxious psychological horror that's vaguely familiar yet refreshingly original.The Last Exorcism is one of the scariest movies to come along in a long time -- until the last five minutes or so, when it completely falls apart.Why should I care if no effort or skill is used to generate sympathy for the film's characters or make us identify with them. \"The Last Exorcism\" is a film without a heart.Demons and rednecks form a terrifying tag-team in this creepy 'Exorcist'/'Blair Witch Project' mash-up.A muddled pass at realism, with scoring cues helping to goose the suspense, a cast of established actors indicating up a storm when they sense the camera is locked on them, and a general cheating of angles to capture the dark magic.Director Daniel Stamm and his screenwriters studiously keep a lid on the proceedings, only letting short puffs of steam escape as the tension mounts.The more hellish the story gets, the sillier and less involving the movie becomes.A modestly chilling, drawn out affair in which the characters and possible \"scientific explanations\" are more interesting than its predictable final destination.It's about the dark side of piety -- the cultish wrath that can emerge out of the high and the mighty. At the center of it all, once again, is a teenage girl's gnashing wrath.Sturdy entry in the ever growing horror mockumentary genre ... benefits from better acting and more clever ideas than usual in the typically one-note films.Creepy, disturbing fun... and very surprising in the way it handles the subject matter differently than how it's been handled in the past.I really liked The Last Exorcism. Surprised the heck out of me.Resorts to a clich\u00e9d and over-the-top ending that negates all of the effective ambiguity that made the middle third of the film so nail-bitingly tense.Is \"The Last Exorcism\" this generation's version of \"The Exorcist\"? No, it comes across more like an unholy hybrid of \"The Blair Witch Project\" and \"The Exorcism of Emily Rose.\"Although the ramshackle closing moments leave something to be desired, overall The Last Exorcism has done a decent job of creating tension without becoming too telegraphed.It pulled the rug out from under me. I left surprised and smiling.A creepy, smartly written and very entertaining low-budget chiller.The prospect of journeying to Hell and back seems less daunting than sitting through another horror yarn made in the faux-documentary style of The Blair Witch Project, but The Last Exorcism proves to be a pleasant surprise.Though sharply uneven and marred by a compromised ending, this cheaply-made horror flick still manages to be creepy for half of its time and provocative in its ideas about religion, faith, and the very medium of film.[A]bsolutely worth seeing... if only for the intriguing debate to be had afterward, if it wouldn't be an even stronger film were the last five minutes or so to be chopped off.the terror it evokes is of such a primal nature, that it is not easily thrown off, burrowing relentlessly into the very marrow on one's bones, and into the deepest, darkest part of one's psycheFor the first three quarters of its running time, The Last Exorcism positively purred and then, as it rounded the final lap, the film completely ruined any good feelings I had for it with a diabolically stupid ending.This is the rare horror film that would have been entertaining even if nothing scary happened.The pseudo-documentary premise is paper-thin at the outset and wears out long before Botko and Gurland's script lurches toward the dumbest and least plausible solution to the mystery.The Last Exorcism is fueled by the arrogance of its smarmy outsider, the expert who knows everything except what an ass he is.Suspenseful, surprising, somewhat terrifying and clever despite its rushed, lazy conclusion.It's human-scaled horror, which is rare enough these days, and enough of it works that The Last Exorcism lingers long after the debate about what is or isn't \"real\" wraps up.A tense and generally understated chiller that might creep you right the hell out.A decently constructed little horror pic that had me constantly amused and entertained throughout, be that from regular and haunted house type laughs and scares. (Parental Review also Available)But producer Eli Roth's The Last Exorcism doesn't reconcile the real identity crisis: a script that can't stop making jokes, undermining the scary stuff with too many giggles and not enough shrieks.Horror movies these days are so often frivolous -- formulaic larks calculated to provide mechanical thrills. Here's one that delivers an experience.It's difficult to find an ending for horror movies. Often the getting there is the fun. That's especially true here.If you ignore the marketing, this is actually a clever and creepy (if ultimately pointless) little thriller possessed by the soul of a horror movie.Every generation gets the devil it deserves, and this faux documentary pulls few punches in its nihilistic depiction of religious belief vs. religious disbelief.A lean and witty variation on the documentary-gone-wrong theme.The purity of the docu conceit falls apart thanks to the intrusion of a spooky score and deliberately eerie camera shots.Doesn't know how to integrate its sillier supernatural elements into the realistic format.It's not just the hand-held camera that will shake you up. The Last Exorcism gives you good reason to be very afraid of the dark.The cast is effective, with everyone sliding believably into their roles.A horror film for the Christian fundamentalist set, The Last Exorcism employs the aesthetic of The Blair Witch Project for a musty demonic-possession tale that promotes strict, anti-modern doctrinal faith as the most righteous path.Boasts a steadier camera, a smarter screenplay and a more fascinating lead performance than [The Blair Witch Project had].That this comes via minimal special effects is admirable, but the movie also cheats a bit: Tinkly piano music is layered onto the spooky moments, which kills the faux-doc \"realism.In its eagerness to deliver familiar genre pleasures, it somehow misplaces its soul.Suspense is nil, phoniness abounds...At my tent revival, I'll pray The Last Exorcism goes platinum.While Daniel Stamm doesn't reinvent the form with the low-budget pseudo-doc The Last Exorcism, he exploits it well.It's like director Daniel Stamm and his crew realized they were treading awfully close to making a film with real depth and edge that horror audiences might hate, and they just couldn't pull the trigger.An ill-considered, laughably dumb coda sequence only compounds Exorcism's numerous problems.The Last Exorcism pulls off its sweetly scary magic trick with great style and panache.Satan gets behind The Last Exorcism in a fiendishly clever plot that starts out creepily enthralling, then collapses in a heap.It's easy to sum up what's wrong with The Last Exorcism -- nothing happensMore than a decade after The Blair Witch project turned the mock-doc format into a horror cliche, this low-tech horror show uses it to chilling effect in this story of cynicism vs. things that go bump in the night.full review at Movies for the MassesA perfectly acceptable, rather low key addition to the horror-mockumentary genre, following a fraudulent Pastor who's decided to allow a camera crew to film one last job extracting the devil from an innocent girl.The Last Exorcism is a rare reminder that the genre label \"horror\" derives from the word horrifying, not horrible.If you're not too found-footaged out after two Paranormal Activities in the past year, The Last Exorcism is sure to be good for a bad, shaky-cam fright or three.Unfortunately the predictable and unoriginal finale undermines the overall impact.The conceit of the premise is entirely plausible and there is enough character establishment in the preparatory scenes to build engagement on a deeper level.What's more, it has something of a twist at the endThe climax owes a debt to a seminal 1960s horror film which it would be unfair to name -- suffice it to say the comparison doesn't do The Last Exorcism any favours.The viewer is placed squarely in the position of anonymous documentarian in this charmingly comic, ably performed, surprisingly sincere and often chilling first-person funhouse of a film.Unfortunately, at about the half-way point, the brittle mood so carefully created by the single-camera coverage is broken by multi-camera editing and the overlaying of creepy music, just like in standard horror fare.A man very much of these times, Cotton is that rarity in the horror genre: a genuinely intriguing character.The Last Exorcism stirs up a caldron of handheld-camera technique, faith-challenged drama and solid acting for a suitably squirmy tale of demonic possession.The scenes of Nell's possession have been done before, but it hardly matters in light of the attention to character in The Last Exorcism.Fabian never makes a false move. Neither does Stamm, who understands that what's left off-screen is often more terrifying than what's on it.The finale is where the biggest problems come in, but director Daniel Stamm is fully capable of ratcheting up a sense of eerie disquiet and mounting tension.The Last Exorcism's cynical take on faith is worse than pandering, it's ineffective.'The Exorcist' meets 'The Blair Witch Project' and gives birth to 'Rosemary's Baby'...a cheesy horror movie in the now commonplace verite style that manages a few easy jolts but overall isn't very scary.It never loses sight of its characters and making sure that the audience remains invested in them through all the hell that follows.Mostly good fun if only for the sentiment expressed by a colleague and shared by a big contingent of horror fans: \"I'm always up for a nice exorcism movie.\"I like that director Daniel Stamm tries to con me with faux supernatural realism in the same way Cotton tries to con the girl he's \"exorcising.\"Oh come on now...this is garbage.Exorcism Genuinely Frightening Despite EndingA spare demonic possession drama that wrings plenty of spooky and often amusing engagement out of its set-up, but is crucially undone by editorial choices which betray its mock-doc framework.the devil remains in the details as to whether this ends up being just another film about satanic goings-on, or a work of multi-layered charlatanism designed to give us, in return for our money, precisely the cathartic treatment that we desire.Slow-burning and well acted it's intriguing without being especially terrifying...\"The Last Exorcism\" Starts Out as a Sharp Religious Satire But Kind of Forgets That When Angling for \"Paranormal Activity\" Scares.The denouement is a letdown, but the faux-documentary premise brings a fresh twist to a tired horror subgenre.At last, a possession movie for lapsed horror acolytes to believe in.Yet another Blair Witch wannabe, The Last Exorcism sets up a relationship between on-screen speakers and \"you,\" addressed as such.Any film that forges as unruly a connection as this one does with its audience deserves some applause, especially when the film belongs to a genre where all too many of its peers come across as rote or as thoughtlessly, remorselessly heartless.The method is well-worn and the subject-matter familiar, but this is a smart, scary little picture.The credibility of faux-documentary filmmaking relies on clear plotting and convincing, semi-improvised acting.The opening 20 minutes offer a brilliant insight into the world of an evangelical minister who is being filmed for a documentary.Anyone with a decent knowledge of horror flicks will surely recoil in terror at how terribly several masterpieces of the genre have been shamelessly ripped off.The latest entry in the pseudo-documentary horror film sweepstakes, The Last Exorcism has its terrifying moments and its silly ones.the proliferation of similarly framed horror movies makes this one feel all the more derivative and overly familiarSomething that helps distinguish The Last Exorcism is the care with which it sets out its stall.The direction and performances are solid enough to hold the attention right up to the maddeningly mishandled ending.Very much an Exorcist for our times.What follows is a masterclass in merciless, gut-twisting terror. But The Last Exorcism also knows when to hold back.The only thing finally astonishing about The Last Exorcism is its goofiness.It's quite refreshing to see a horror movie with high-quality performances like Patrick Fabian and Ashley Bell deliver here.A few good scenes, and a decent performance by Fabian, but standard hokum for the most part.A clever, small film that depicts showman-preachers and horror movies with a wink and nod, The Last Exorcism spends most of its 88 minutes staying a cut above the average horror flick.The characters are better than in any of the other pseudo-documentary films.When I left the theater, I was exhausted and freaked out and totally bejeezus-less.Another cheap horror film dressed up like a documentary.Stamm effectively crafts a dozen or so marvellously creepy moments. Audience faith in the existence of decent horror films is reaffirmed.Ultimately comes across as a bizarre coupling of This is Spinal Tap and Rosemary's Baby.Draws on The Blair Witch Project and The Exorcist to supremely creepy effect.(The film) is at its best when it poses as many practical as theological explanations...thought-provoking and intense until the over-the-top, Blair Witch-y finale.Despite some solid acting from Fabian and Bell the convoluted plot becomes silly and predictable at the end.These are very assured strides into the mainstream from director Daniel Stamm, and he's certainly guaranteed himself a few enticing offers when the time for his next film comes around.Eli Roth-produced frighter looks neat, but that's itBrilliantly directed, superbly written and genuinely scary, this is a hugely enjoyable horror flick with a terrific, star-making central performance from Patrick Fabian.Satan stalks the bible belt, as the occult locks horns so to speak, with free lance forensics, family dysfunction, and more sociopathic urges. And a not too hip Lucifer who thinks he's offering a doubting demon buster man of the cloth a 'blowing job.'Neither as good as I'd hoped, nor as bad I'd feared -- nor as unintentionally funny as the trailer -- The Last Exorcism is a pretty good little horror picture.The finale may come out of nowhere -- you probably won't see it coming -- but this can (un) happily join The Blair Witch Project and Paranormal Activity as superior horror.A textbook example of fumbling the ball on the goal line.Hardcore gore-hounds will be disappointed by the lack of flashy special effects, but The Last Exorcism is more concerned with psychological chills and succeeds admirably in evoking them.Does a great job of sustaining tension by distracting you with (get this) interesting characters and a novel approach.If you make a film about exorcism, you better be ready to be compared to one of the best films ever made. Surprisingly, the film holds its own in that regard.The seams are obvious in this faux documentary, but the thrills are fairly genuine.Its mature focus on characterization really sets the film apart.Even if you take \"The Last Exorcism\" on its own terms, you're going to be in for quite an uneventful movie.A fairly absorbing pseudo-documentary demonic-possession flick with all the bodily contortions and jittery camerawork you'd expect.It's disappointing--if not exactly surprising--when at the halfway point the film turns into THE LINDA BLAIR WITCH PROJECT.The Last Exorcism is completely boring, devoid of any scares, tension or unease and has one of the worst endings ever. Avoid at all costs.The Last Exorcism is a tasty slice of religious themed exploitation of little innovation, yet with plenty of thrills....ultimately fares a whole lot better in its first half than in its second...",

The best thing that can be said of the film is that it is well intentionedIf it is to be remembered, it'll be for all the wrong reasons.The modestly scaled film delivers some moving and affecting moments amid a preponderance of scenes of frequently annoying people behaving badly.A strong romantic drama in which Robert Pattinson and Emilie de Ravin really shine.There is much to be impressed with here.Tween and teen girls will weep in the cheap seats, while adults will be narked by the ending, a shameful piggyback on a national tragedy, which will further the career of the heart-throb.Remember Me provides some mild domestic spats and lots of picturesque male brooding, but it's a pallid and oddly exploitative affair.It is the cinematic equivalent of a mournful track from a cool indie band until we get to that awkward finale.Pattinson's young female fans are likely to find this film less unbearable than anyone else. But even they may find the big emotional climax, which exploits a major terrorist disaster, cheap and pretentious.R-Patz shows he can act, standing toe to toe with the fine Chris Cooper and looking like James Dean in comparison to the annoying Tate Ellington, who plays Tyler's \"comedy\" flatmate.Much better than you might expect.A sleepy weepie with an 11th-hour reveal which is a trifling reward for enduring the soapy slusher that precedes it.Screenwriter Will Fetters stretches 30 minutes of drama to almost two hours of screen time, relying on the actors to scowl and brood while they wait for something to happen to their characters.Even before the manipulative final act, this film will get on the nerves of most viewers with its over-serious tone and sentimentalised plotThis shameless romantic drama tries to wring tears out of susceptible audiences by exploiting one of the most infamous, tragic moments in America's recent past.[Pattinson is] like Luke Perry doing James Dean in the dreariest John Hughes movie ever made: Some Kind of Terrible.Pattinson's hero is well drawn, emerging as yet another descendent of Holden Caulfield.If you thought New Moon was genius, this movie will be your Casablanca.The whole thing plods along to you-know-what, which would probably provoke a pretty good ethics-in-storytelling debate if weren't so overtly manipulative, mawkish and dependent on a moment too emotionally obscure for Remember Me's target audience.An endless parade of melodrama blind with rage and completely irrational.There are no less than four tremendous performances in the film.Robert Pattinson's hair will get the teens in for this mopey New York romance, but goodness, do they have a shock in store.Until the end, the film works as a look into lives under stress looking for redemption, and for that, it's difficult to write off the whole for a relatively tiny sliver.\"Remember Me\" is only slightly more than forgettable, but its good intentions and good performances can't make up for a central romance that feels more rushed than real thanks to the triumph of casting and celebrity over chemistry and charm.Put it this way, Coulter, there are over 3000 true stories you could have told, and this film may insult every single one.... leaden and lifeless, everything keyed to the lugubrious brooding of Pattinson's hilariously bad performance ...Pattinson divides his time between get-even mating, wall sex and addressing grade school bullying by terrorizing a classroom full of mean girls while tossing their desks around. Which comes off as even scarier than his obsession around sucking necks.Arrogant in forcing a large-scale weight to a story and characters much too flimsy to deserve, much less support, it.Sometimes the worst filmmaking choices are those in which the good intentions can still be felt.Pattinson broods the whole time in this only okay film.A teen-pleasing, low-key indie romance with one of the most demented final twists ever.Pattinson, while unlikely to win over doubters, acquits himself well enough to suggest a career beyond moody bloodsucking.If Remember Me does well at the box office, it will in no way be a reflection of the film's merits.Dear oh dear, the problems and the acting-out with which the wealthy must content.Remember Me actually does know exactly where it's going. It just takes too long to get there.Remember Me is a sweet and sombre melodrama of two wounded souls finding hope and love in pre 9/11 New York.Without providing proper context to justify the citation of this devastating chapter in history, the twist exposes Mr. Fetters as a mere lazy opportunist.The shamelessly exploitative ending simply knocks it down another peg, ironically turning \"Remember Me\" into a film that will fade from memory pretty quickly.Thoughtful and a step above the typical romantic drama.It's a mope-a-thon that rivals New Moon for downbeat moodiness.A disappointingly schamltzy romantic melodrama that will not do much to promote Robert (Twilight) Pattinson's career as legit actor.I hate this movie. I hate it a lot.Live in the moment. Carpe Diem. Get Busy Livin. We get it, already.Overwritten and overcooked, Remember Me still manages a few explosive sequences between Pattinson and Pierce Brosnan.Even if you disapprove of just where the film goes, the story building up to the final climatic twist is moving and real.Allows [Robert] Pattinson to be a livelier, looser presence on screen than he is as Edward Cullen, but the broody star still doesn't show much range.A tearjerker piled on a tearjerker...a gloomily mawkish, manipulative soap opera that uses the sad historical context in a way many will consider offensive.... too overripe in the melodrama department for modern audiences, but it features some credible acting and a ten hanky weep for those in the mood.A romantic drama about the tender bloom of love in a garden of death, grief, and great loss.Pattinson's and de Ravin's charisma elevate what could have been a dreary affair, though the final sucker-punch is arguably unnecessary.With any luck, Robert Pattinson's naysayers will be silenced after they take a gander at his convincing, even magnetic work in Remember Me, a romantic drama more interested in character nuance than story innovation.Parental Content ReviewOverloaded with hair-trigger melodrama that leaves the its cast in a permanent state of hackneyed hysterics. And oh yeah, they go \"there\" and there's nothing we can do to stop that locomotive.Full of hot air.For me, [the ending] was enough to tip the already teetering scales into a \"thumbs down.\"\"Remember Me\" is a movie with an urgent message. The message is: Please consider seeing another movie.Remember Me is best low to the ground, modestly picking apart neuroses and grief. Taking matters to pointlessly epic proportions only reinforces just how anemic the rest of the picture is.a turgid excuse for a perceptive character study/romance that pins its hopes on a twist that is not so much a jolt as an affrontThe positives are trampled by the heavy boots of poor plot points, a trumped-up third act conflict and an emotionally exploitative ending that is, quite simply, appalling.I hate the ending. I hate it. I hate it. I hate it. I hate it more than Kim Basinger hates Alec Baldwin. I hate more than Garfield hates Mondays.After the first hint of what's coming -- which crops up less than 10 minutes into the movie and then doesn't let up -- the foreshadowing becomes so distracting that, by the time the darn thing goes off, there's only a sense of relief.Time for a quick game of One of These Things Is Not Like the Others: Marlon Brando. James Dean. Robert Pattinson.Romantic, angst-ridden melodrama, aimed specifically at Pattinson's young female fans.Remember Me represents Robert Pattinson's attempt to prove he can do more than sparkle like a faux vampire, but the case he presents is not convincing.Limp and witless. A romantic drama with all the body of chicken noodle soup.The film's tone is all wrong, the pacing is dead and the veering between sex, sadness and sado-masochistic violence is enough to give you motion sickness. It's a bad movie.Remember Me is a touching love story, but its broader tale of familial relations packs a greater emotional punch.So many terrible things happen to the people in Allen Coulter's Remember Me that when the last awful twist comes -- something so resounding and meaningful that it instantly, horribly cheapens the rest of the movie -- you're almost numb to it.The final scenes of the film are bold and provocative. I salute that, but they also left a bad taste in my mouth.Somewhere the heart that must anchor a romantic drama has gone missing. We don't so much feel the relationships as see them.The commercials make it seem like a typical angst-filled college romance and, in large part, it is. But in the end, it becomes something more, but describing exactly what would do a disservice to its often subtly crafted story.A seemingly inconsequential action at the climax becomes a profound life-changer, giving each character's journey an unpredictable -- and I would argue, contrived -- conclusion.If Remember Me is remembered for anything at all, other than being yet another Robert Pattinson vehicle, it will be for its over-the-top ending, which ranks high amongst the most shameless jerkers of tears ever unleashed upon lachrymose teens.It's all weepy drool until the twist ending, which turns it shockingly offensive.There's no shame in exploring tragedy through art. But exploiting it to make your very ordinary movie feel more important? That's another story.It turns out Robert Pattinson sparkles after all. [T]he script shimmers with sensitivity and a meticulous attention to emotional detail...Only slightly edgier and no more sensible than a Nicholas Sparks story.Remember Me is a far more accurate barometer of Robert Pattinson's acting chops than that teen vampire franchise.The film gets bogged down by plot points that plod toward an event of devastating proportions.This mawkish trash is bad enough even before it stoops to using the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks for sympathy. Unforgivable.In Remember Me love means never having to say you're sorry, particularly to the audience.There's a sense of construction to Remember Me that undercuts its emotional impact, and emotional impact is pretty much all this film is shooting for.A small, dense chamber study of unhappy people looking for hope in the darkness, often literally.There are enough layers to the drama in Remember Me that makes it hard to immediately discount or dismiss it as frivolous teen girl fare.Pattinson gets to sink his teeth into something more than posturing.Ambitious but overwrought, with a polarizing final act.The finale manages to be tasteful and exploitative at the same time. It touts forgiveness while being mildly infuriating. Such is the danger of borrowing from the enormous to merely entertain. If that....in a matter of minutes Remember Me goes from something that might have been memorable to a wholly unnecessary disappointment.It takes a lot to act horribly troubled for no obvious reason and have an audience buy it. Amiable as he is, Pattinson doesn't attain that in Remember Me.An insignificant film that desperately wants to be significant. Still, thanks to a decent cast and mostly solid direction, it manages to be at least moderately entertaining through its running time.Dark, disturbing romance not for Twilight's preteen fans.A simple romance for swooners that wins points for noting that two lovers bring with them a clashing mess of family and friends[The ending] shamelessly exploits a real-life event, an iconic moment whose heartbreak far eclipses anything this cheap melodrama contrives.Pattinson has gone from brooding, adoring Bella, saving Bella, and trying not to kill anyone to brooding, adoring Ally saving various people, and trying not to kill anyone.Robert Pattinson is charismatic and charming in much of \"Remember Me,\" but the bad news for his fans is they have to content themselves with good work in a ridiculous film.What was a well acted, heartfelt love story of two wounded souls finding each other and learning to heal is obliterated in one vile, manipulative swoop. This ending wasn't deep or thought-provoking; this was a sucker punch.The ill-conceived climax will strike the easily manipulated as deep but will cause most discerning viewers to recognize it for a cheap trick that should come with some sort of trigger warning before it unfolds.The script calls for several scenes with gut-wrenching, hard-core emotional outbursts. They're so bad they're embarrassing. Robert Pattinson should stick to sulking.Sadly, the most memorable aspect of the film is a groan-inducing surprise ending that trivializes a horrific catastrophe and reminds viewers how vapid the rest of the movie is....too manipulative to set itself apart as truly original, but too emotionally invested to be completely dismissed.Robert Pattinson can really act when he is supported by a great cast. As the film reached it's climax I slowly moved my hand over my mouth in shock.Robert Pattinson's star vehicle runs out of gascalculated and ham handedThe New Yorkers who inhabit this overwrought melodrama with a mega twist are so self-centered that the message -- life should be savored, not squandered -- gets lost.In \"Remember Me,\" Robert Pattinson, the producer and leading man, displays genuine acting chops as a \"Rent\"-related cousin of the \"Rebel Without a Cause.\"If this movie is playing at a theatre near you, you might want to consider moving somewhere else.A movie that surprises in many ways, one being how much better it is than expected.The fact is, Remember Me is a well-made movie. I cared about the characters. I felt for them.The more you wait for the biggest plot development of the last decade to reduce everybody's problems to a hill of beans, the more Remember Me starts to make you feel cheap.[Q]uietly charming and coarsely handsome, a sensitively observed story about young people in love seen through a keen eye for the unglamorous side of New York City that we don't often see on film these days...Slaps, screams, and airborne fire extinguishers thoroughly destroy the film's air of mopey sincerity to bits.There's a distinctly bittersweet undertow to the picture that draws you in and helps you overlook the film's weaknesses.A movie with all the hyperventilating hysteria of a 1960s teen-tragedy pop song and all the disposability, too.Bless you, R.Patz & Co., because this gloriously steaming pile is officially in the bad-movies-we-love pantheon.A distasteful meal that Pattinson's partisans might mistake for profundity.Anyone longing to watch Pattinson do his best James Dean will see it in this deliberately paced story set in the summer of 2001.More tacky and preposterous than the worst blockbuster phone-in.I laughed the hollow laugh of a cynical old movie critic during the eye-rolling final scene, which is certainly not meant to be funny....Pattinson's magnetic work as the protagonist plays a significant role in cementing Remember Me's mild success...[The lead] character appears to consist solely of his reluctance to shave and his massive cigarette habit that is given more screentime than most of the named characters.Remember Me is charged up with stormy melodrama. Pattinson's various fan contingents should eat it up...Ultimately rendered unwatchable by an unbelievably crass ending that is both manipulative and reprehensible.The drama -- a far cry from the vampire stories of Twilight -- allows Pattinson to show broader emotional range. But the script is rife with clich\u00e9s, and the sex is so artily lit it seems direct from cable.I kept expecting Pattinson to scream, 'You're tearing me apart,' or claim that he 'coulda been a contender,' which, unfortunately, he never does.Remember asks too much of its audience.Robert Pattinson proves he can do more than fanged heartthrob, but while the film should sate his legion fans til their next Twilight fix, there's not a lot here for the rest of us.Be warned, if you're vulnerable to outrageous, cringe-inducing implausibilities -- not least the ludicrous stand-up row between Tyler and his father in the latter's Twin Towers boardroom -- you'd best give this one a miss.Decently shot and directed as it is, it lacks any real flame.Best forgotten.When the film finally goes for broke with that ambitious, colossally misconceived finale, a tremendous emotional investment in these characters is necessary to pull it off -- and even then, its prospects would be questionable.Although clearly it was mapped by a team of consultants, Remember Me is a horrific misstep in the branding of Robert Pattinson.Allen Coulter directed this morose and sluggish drama, which gets more mileage from Pattinson's anguished profile than from Will Fetters's thunderously overwritten screenplay.Shame on them!Angst-ridden, wanna-be tear-jerker - featuring Robert Pattinson as another tortured, brooding James Dean-type - doesn't come close to earning its big payoff.",

        "document": "You absolutely have to see this film if only for Waltz' performance as Landa -- it's the most inspired, carefully nuanced and perfectly pitched performance of the year.Throw a dozen outrageous characters at the screen and stick them in equally shocking plots and sub-plots and see what sticks. With Inglourious Basterds everything sticks.'Subtle' is not a word in Tarantino's lexicon. At the film's heart is a fatal attempt to conflate fact with fiction and a celebration of vengeance that's misplaced and embarrassing.An entertaining yet uneven movie that provides comedy, drama and some interesting psychological twists and turns, but never quite delivers on that 'men on a mission' promise.The film is by no means terrible but those things we think of as being Tarantino-esque, the long\u2028 stretches of wickedly funny dialogue, the humor in the violence and outsized \u2028characters strutting across the screen, are largely missing.Tarantino swaps fact for pulp fiction; Quentin Tarantino has made a glorious, silly, blood-spattered return.It's a film that's only interested in film, a masterclass in gorgeously-constructed self-pastiche. Tarantino desperately needs an editor willing to trim his indulgences.With a confidence typical of its director, the last line of Inglourious Basterds is, \"This might just be my masterpiece.\" While that may not be true, this is an often dazzling movie that sees QT back on exhilarating form.Damn Gud FunChristoph Waltz delivers one of the most brilliant portrayals of a villain I've seen since Anthony Hopkins transformed himself into Hannibal Lecter.By far the best World War II film I've ever seen....The more knowledgeable you are about WWII history and 20th Century pop culture, the more you will appreciate this Tarantino absurdity. What a wildly violent and memorable absurdity it is.Quentin Tarantino has finally made a movie that means something, though I think that's happened entirely by accident...This is a FILM with blood in its veins, a heart in its body and a red hot engine in its chassis. It is alive with ideas and a geniune belief in the power of FILM to express them.A whole lot of movie, but it's also technically mature filmmaking to a thematically juvenile end.A film geek's revisionist history of the Third Reich's death knell as portrayed by the Quentin Tarantino players.\"Basterds\" is very audacious with comic book-like characters and dialogue, a B-movie sensibility and a serial-like disdain for logic.Quentin is back with his best film ever - a rip roaring action adventure wrapped up as a fairy tale of sortsI got the feeling that shock, confusion, and even disgust greeted the misinformed Jewish patrons itching for rapture.Tension, twists, humor, and it's constant. This is the best adult 'Once Upon a Time' I can think of.Just like 100-degree plus weather and muggy conditions, it's been a miserable summer movie season but fortunately Quentin Tarantino is ready to cool us off with a welcome refreshing dose of quality entertainment with his latest ingenious work 'InglouriousInglourious Basterds is as much fun as you can have in a cinema without embarrassing an usher or making your popcorn too salty.[Quentin Tarantino has] whacked history over the head and cut away all the boring bits, leaving behind a blood-drenched war epic like no other.Satire and sanctimony -- Tarantino rules.Basterds is not great Tarantino but it's solidly good Tarantino, and that's sweet news for his fans.That isn't the way the history books tell it, but after seeing this overripe wonder you may prefer Tarantino's take.This spaghetti-western-inspired war film is a watchable mix of the good, the bad and the ugly.Ideological sentimentality is not a charge that could be made against Tarantino, but his film thereafter, though consistently gripping, is uneven and fractured.These Basterds blend into a much richer story, a hugely entertaining one with stars you don't immediately see shining.Tarantino's wartime fantasies may leave history in the dust, but his movie is a surprisingly satisfying contribution to movies about the Holocaust.Quentin Tarantino is like a kid in a candy store reinventing WWII... [with] a wallop of a climax that reimagines a cinema auditorium as a Holocaust gas chamber by way of the throne of the great and powerful wizard of Oz.Waltz as an actor proves to be the best match for Tarantino's dialogue since Samuel L. Jackson -- his ability to mix casual chitchat with a dark undercurrent of menace (in three different languages, no less) makes him a mesmerizing presence.Despite the injection of content from a variety of directions, Basterds lacks the crackly excitement of Tarantino's other efforts, mainly because he can't seem to tie the whole package together.Vintage Tarantino returns to the big screen and he's brought all his trademark moves with him.It has been a problem in the past that Tarantino's voice could be heard in the lines he wrote, but the mesmerising Waltz takes that gleeful relish of language and presents it as a vital aspect of Landa's professional pride.A failure so complete that it is infuriating as opposed to merely disappointingInglourious Basterds will be loved and hated, sometimes in the same scene, eventually leading to at least grudging admiration.If you really like movies, chances are you like Tarantino. And if you like Tarantino, chances are you'll like Inglourious Basterds.It may be an unexpected adventure of unusual proportions and design, but it's still the most glorious adventure of the summer.At the end of the day, Basterds is a series of strongly made, if expertly (over)written, pieces that never really come together into one coherent whole.[It] gets by on typical Tarantino gumption.Tarantino's ensemble converses at length in basement taverns and cinema lobbies and war rooms, and the best exchanges are tricky, chesslike psycho-verbal games of subterfuge.This has to be regarded as the most unusual movie of the year. The movie is imaginative and so full of curveball ideas that you can't wait to see what will happen next.As entertaining as it is audacious, a film that showcases Tarantino in top form and boasts a multitude of characters who could easily carry a movie of their own.Amongst all the filmmakers working today, no one inspires more passionate discussion, debate and analysis than Quentin Tarantino.Quentin Tarantino is back on form with a bang with what might just be his finest film yet.Nobody but Tarantino could have made Inglourious Basterds and, in a homogenising culture such as Hollywood, that's worth celebrating....a wartime opus whose shortcomings upon first viewing are as immediately recognizable as the fact they will after many more of them prove to be virtues...Strip away Tarantino's pulp fiction and his love for post-modern pastiche and the film is a slice of entertainment grounded in moral seriousness.A brutal, audacious, triumphant piece of filmmaking that hits harder than a baseball bat to the jawbone.The true moral universe in which the film unfolds is that of the spaghetti westerns...: a world in which the strong are above the law and the way to tell the good guys from the bad guys is not by their acts but by the kind of hats they wear.Is this Tarantino's masterpiece, as the movie's final shot not so subtly seems to suggest? I believe it's one of them. In the end, we're left with superior storytelling from one of cinema's most talented practitioners.Intermittently-inspired World War II epic ... the thread of the drama is left disjointed and the focus ever-changing.It's a violent wish-fulfillment fantasy, and if such a thing is necessarily immoral, then Inglourious Basterds is immoral. But it's also -- necessarily -- a provocation.A sprawling feast of a movie that's by turns funny, exciting, outrageous and just plain exhilarating, Inglourious Basterds actually is the event it was touted to be.This is filmmaking at its bravest, and whether Tarantino is a genius or a fool, he does nothing by accident.Tarantino is much less interested in the gory possibilities of the premise than he is in old-fashioned suspense and tension... a rollicking, wish-fulfillment revenge fantasy about getting Hitler that is presented with a graphic novel ambiance punctuated with moments of brilliant tension....dont expect a pure action adventure. Thats not what this ones about.Enough action and ghoulish humor to offset all the boring \"my dinner with Fritz\" pace-killing scenes, adolescent slasher gore, misogyny and Bush-Cheney-inspired anything-goes war rules.Generally thrilling, even if some stretches of conversation tend to the long side.The cameo by Rod Taylor and the references to Yvette Mimieux (the stars of 'The Time Machine') are the tip-offs: This is Tarantino's celebration of cinema as time machine -- a device that can erase the years and, on an imaginative level, change the past.The stylish Inglourious Basterds means next to nothing, but its pure outlandishness draws eyes to the screen.Fierce, fascinating, literate, ballsy, shocking, whimsical, devastating, brazenly inventive, and nothing less than wholly hypnotic.Inglorious Basterds is an entertainment but an uneasy one; it represents 153 minutes of bravura stalling, after which its creator loses interest and walks away.One of the best war movies of the decade not because it's about war, but because it's about war movies.Tonally schizoid and rife with anachronisms (a David Bowie song on the sound track, out-of-era vernacular), Tarantino's Third Reich folly is utterly exasperating.Inglourious Basterds is sporadically enjoyable, but it's also a dismal squandering of a once-promising talent.Inglourious Basterds is sprawling, flawed and hugely self-indulgent. It's also hugely enjoyable.Inglourious Basterds constantly challenges its viewer's emotions, making us question whether or not we should be feeling the compassion, hatred, or empathy that we do.Don't go into Inglourious Basterds expecting a serious WWII film and you'll probably end up having fun with it.For anyone who has been hoping to see Tarantino back at the top of his game, the must-see movie of the summer has finally arrived.Tarantino seems to have gotten high on the fumes of his own (admittedly addictive) creation here and just not known when to quit.Lively and literate, Inglourious Basterds feels fresher than any Tarantino film in a while. Even so, smart as his writing is, it wouldn't kill him to see a blue pencil now and again.This exploitation epic is a unique beast that molests history, wrong-foots expectations and royally entertains. The movies' coolest Basterd is back on his game.Parental Content ReviewOnce again, Tarantino refuses to deliver something easily dissected or discussed, something that has made him one of the most polarizing filmmakers of the last two decades. If only there were more like him.Despite the trailer's first impressions, Inglourious Basterds is much more than Brad Pitt with a funny accent and a few Hitler-stache cameos.Tarantino engages with the power of language, not only spoken but cinematic language in particular. He relishes the way movies speak to an audience, the manipulative power of cinematic dialect to tell facts differently, and how film language can replace mBravura filmmaking at its finest.The Dirty Dozen it most definitely is not. It's a war movie like no other, a 21st century film nerd's take on the 20th century's most tragic chapter. Cinderella's slipper and Sherlock Holmes' pipe are among the unlikely delights in QT's best film to date.It's not quite on par with the genre-busting Pulp Fiction, but Tarantino's seventh film is just as assuredly paced and remarkably more mature.Who could possibly resist a World War II movie with a climax that somehow manages to work in exact visual quotes from not one, but two Brian DePalma movies?'I've had no issues in working with the Weinsteins. They're ma boyz!,' Tarantino exclaimed in our Chicago interview both with anticipated media training but also with genuine indebtedness to the brotherly duo. 'They're coming back in a big way.'After two and a half hours, it's impossible to question the greatness within but hard to ignore what also makes it his most laboring and flawed feature to date.a war film about war. That's rarer than you think.Christoph Waltz matches Lecter, Vader, and the Wicked Witch of the West with a performance that shows off his fluency in English, German, French, Italian...and evil.Tarantino fans, among many others, will have a great good time.The story is wildly, daringly imaginative, the sort of thing that very few filmmakers could even conceive, let alone execute.There are no pure heroes or villains in Tarantino's vision of WWII, just varying degrees of the dredges of humanity in a time and place where the shadows have free reign.It's a meditation on movies, but also an exploration of the art of seduction.There's a feast here, particularly in the amazing opening, an unexpected essay on King Kong, and performances by Pitt, Laurent, and Waltz. It's just been placed on a huge table with no consideration of whether it adds up to a meal.Exciting, if uneven, exhilarating in the theme of Jewish empowerment and righteous revenge.Tarantino's finest effort, the best movie of the year to this point, and a sure-fire contender for Best Picture, plus several acting honors.The film serves up revenge with a whopping side of 'merry.' Looking at the sunny side of the strasse, Christoph Waltz' giddy Col. Landa throws 1 hell of a Nazi party, practically skipping in his jackboots.Tarantino seems to be scrutinizing his obsession with the cinema by cleverly placing it into an apt historical context.Tarantino understands that the key ingredient in a thriller is the suspense...it's the tension that thrills you, that makes you squirm and feel totally alive to the moment.A bold, gory and glorious cinematic fest liberally doused with humour, satire and entertainment valueBe prepared for unsettling shifts in pace and tone, be prepared to be shocked and amused, to laugh and guffaw and to be always surprised in this comic fantasy which is cheeky enough to reinvent history and has audiences clapping as it does soA spellbinding picture that helps prove the superiority of historical fiction over documentaries.A glourious rude mix 'n match of subtitles, nazi scalps, guerrilla cinema and testicle blood-soaked subterranean French cellar saloon shootouts, the film is a vintage QT Western European western. In other words, Tarantino's WWII heartfelt warsploit rocks.A tense, thrilling, brilliantly acted and superbly directed war flick that just might be Tarantino's masterpiece.Even though it's long and indulgent, this is a deeply entertaining romp, crafted to perfection by Tarantino and his amazing cast.A fundamentally silly piece of fiction and far too few occasions when Tarantino manages to produce the kind of spectacular cinematic moment combining character, script and editing that first signalled him out as a virtuoso director.QT is rediscovering his form: Basterds is a tense, punchy and darkly funny film.What really makes Inglourious Basterds stick out like a Royale with cheese...is its sheer playfulness. Tarantino does digress, as is his wont, but these are not the irritating indulgences they were in Kill Bill.If the accomplishment of this first scene were upheld throughout then we might have a masterpiece on our hands. Alas, it is uneven as well as unpredictable.Whirled around the floor of a story that goes absolutely nowhere, contains no human verities, has no significant heft as historical drama, yet still proves, now and then, an entertaining piece of Pop Disco Art from the cinema's most talented tease.When a man makes a movie this good, you can forgive him the occasional indulgence.His latest is too long, too talkative and a touch too self-indulgent. But it's a heck of a lot better than anything he's done since Pulp.The endless twists and turns coupled with Tarantino's trademark black comedy help take the edge off the violence a little.As relentlessly audacious and engrossing as anything within Quentin Tarantino's flawless body of work...MagnificentA piece of bravura filmmaking, a scrumptiously over the top revenge fantasy that melds high comedy with tragic melodrama for pure hypnotic effect. I've never enjoyed a Tarantino movie more.Some of it is good; much of it is preposterous. In trying to meld comedy and tragedy it entertains fitfully and requires more patience than most Tarantino films do.Tarantino's best movie to date turns out to be his latest movie, which clashes together history and fantasy, intentionally echoes back to many of the World War II movies that came before it, and uses them to inform it.A brilliantly made, polarizing affair.If you love Quentin, get ready for a hell of a ride!This is a revenge fantasy where the non-Jewish Tarantino wants us to cheer on the violent Jews because - as we see - their victims more than deserve their fates....a long, strange pop artifact, studded with instant-classic moments and sealed with a legitimately great image...At times Inglourious Basterds is arguably the best picture of the year, full of the joy and verve and filmmaking prowess that has so marked Mr. Tarantino's best work.The final impression of the movie - that it's crass, juvenile and profoundly distasteful - overrides its more enjoyable moments.Quentin Tarantino's extremely witty revenge fantasy Inglourious Basterds may be the most fun you'll have at the movies this summer.By turns surprising, nutty, windy, audacious and a bit caught up in its own cleverness, the picture is a completely distinctive piece of American pop art with a strong Euro flavor that's new for the director.This unashamed slice of Second World War hokum finds Quentin Tarantino in mischievous form as he takes on the Second World War with the driving force of a roller coaster ride.Call it Pulp War Fiction--likely to divide critics, Tarantino's WWII fable interweaves little fact with much fiction, serving as a vessel for his playful, self-reflexive, postmodern commentary on a genre he knows and admires.After some indulgent side trips (Grindhouse, Deathproof), Quentin Tarantino is back to form with this World War II fantasy fiasco. It's mad, it's bad and it's thoroughly entertaining, with some of the most disciplined storytelling Tarantino has produced.Glorious.Tarantino tries his hand at an international ensemble with some rather 'Inglourious' results.Every film that Quentin Tarantino makes is a cinematic event of mammoth proportions, and this one is no different. It lives up to the director's brilliant international reputation and accordingly so does he.Hysterically fun and gloriously excessive, Quentin Tarantino's latest is right up there with Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill.F**k I loved this movie!In an age when everyone rushes to remake old movies and old TV shows and comic books and toys and whatever, Quentin [Tarantino] decided to remake World War II. And this time? It ends right.Quentin Tarantino is starting to remind me of late-stage Kubrick.Every moment of genre-mashing, basking in the glow of left-field sound cues or funking up a scene's rhythm with unexpected edits has been a dress rehearsal of sorts for Inglourious Basterds.Whatever Inglourious Basterds lacks as a satisfying whole, it makes up for in the sum total of its assertive parts.For all its visual bravura and occasional bursts of antic inspiration, it feels trivial, the work of a kid who can't stop grabbing his favorite shiny plaything.The movie is an ungainly pastiche, yet on some wacked-out Jungian level it's all of a piece.Inglourious Basterds is not boring, but it's ridiculous and appallingly insensitive-a Louisville Slugger applied to the head of anyone who has ever taken the Nazis, the war, or the Resistance seriously.[A] bleakly comic revenge fantasy... [that] is, hilariously, all about acknowledging the power of cinema: have your revenge, but have it on film...Ballsy, brash and utterly committed to the revolutionary power of cinema, Inglourious Basterds is a completely remarkable film.Scenes like the showdown in the tavern and the movie-premiere finale are as imaginative, energetic and, in their own weird, brutal way, beautiful as cinema gets.Tarantino's signature nastiness and his juvenile delight in shocking the audience undercut the movie's larger purpose.Quentin Tarantino does it again. Again.War reduced to pop entertainment should at least be easy to swallow, but this stuff keeps getting stuck in our craw. The trash that Tarantino used to elevate he now imitates.Simply another testament to his movie love. The problem is that by making the star attraction of his latest film a most delightful Nazi, one whose smooth talk is as lovingly presented as his murderous violence, Mr. Tarantino has polluted that love.All the trademark Tarantino flourishes are here -- the joyous splaying of gore; the self-referential dialogue; the artful artificiality and the juxtaposition of humor and violence -- but they don't add up to much.The pop-art auteur's least-focused film to date, a rambling wreck of shrewd ideas and cinematic influences that never interlock into their own identifiable movie.The movie is fun -- Tarantino makes clever use of language and the mechanics of making and projecting movies -- but his ability to juggle multiple storylines isn't as sure as it was in Pulp Fiction, which Basterds resembles structurally.One basterd of a movie... Who wants to hear Quentin Tarantino dialogue in a foreign language, thus having to read it?Tarantino has a created a more moving tale about the Jews and the Nazis during World War II than, for example, last year's much more reverent Defiance, which was actually based on a true story yet came off as shtick.Its biggest flaw, though, for those who care about such things, may be its moral attitude. That might seem a stodgy thing to bring up in the context of a Quentin Tarantino movie, but it takes such center stage that it needs to be examined.97% mature, solid, suspenseful, respectful, artistic, violent, sophisticated, tremulous, funny, surprisingWhy is Basterds such a colossal disappointment? It's mostly because Tarantino indulges all of his worst impulses as a filmmaker and ignores what he does best.By letting his brilliant dialogue-centered screenplay showcase his superb cast and keeping the gory violence in check, this fictional WWII saga is Tarantino's masterpiece. Who knew?t's so rich in cinematic value, it's difficult for me to understand how a film critic could fail to be impressed by it.Everything else [except the Basterds themselves] works so beautifullyIt fails as conventional war movie, as genre spoof, as trash and as pulp.An unrealistic over-the-top madcap WW II drama that seamlessly mixes violence, vulgarian comedy and cinema lore.Gloriously directed and written, 'Inglourious Basterds' is a must for Quentin Tarantino fans.Pretentious? Narcissistic? Gory? What's Not to Love?Austrian actor Christoph Waltz creates the most compelling big-screen villain since Heath Ledger's Joker. An Oscar-worthy performance.Sensationally entertaining, relentlessly suspenseful and thrilling with a terrific ensemble cast and wickedly funny and witty dialogue. Tarantino fans rejoice!If only Quentin Tarantino the director weren't so completely in love with Quentin Tarantino the writer, Inglourious Basterds might have been a great movie rather than just a good movie with moments of greatness.There will be blood.Energetic, inventive, swaggering fun, Quentin Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds is a consummate Hollywood entertainment -- rich in fantasy and blithely amoral.Even if you wish Tarantino would calm down a bit and rely more on his considerable skills at straightforward storytelling, this World War II saga is undeniably suspenseful, violent and entertaining.As is often the case with Tarantino's post-1990's output, great scenes are adrift in an undisciplined sea of ugly-spirited, juvenile self-indulgence.Tarantino's most polished work to date.Like all Quentin Tarentino movies, this feverish Jews-take-out-the-Nazis-during-World-War-II movie is really all about Quentin Tarentino. Not that that's necessarily a bad thing.World War II was more serious, complex and horrifying than all this comic embellishment, but if I sound critical, I apologize in advance. I had a helluva time watching Inglourious Basterds.QT manipulates WWII horror into hip pornography -- Jewish revenge looks just like the sadism in Eli Roth's Hostel movie. Our political and moral responses are discombobulated.Inglourious Basterds is a mixture that some will think is a masterpiece; others will think it an audacious hodgepodge. I think I'm among the latter.Inglourious is slow, dumb -- and in a first for QT in his cinema savant career -- incompetent.It's nasty and exhilarating stuff.One of the best performances of the decade in one of the most entertaining movies of the year.I don't know if I've ever seen a revenge fantasy so willfully messed up, sometimes offensively so, that still manages to be worthwhile for whole sections of its 2 1/2 hours. The opening is as good a sequence as Tarantino has ever created.Although Inglourious Basterds is not the best representation of Tarantino's genius, he can do no wrong, even if it is sometimes misguided and laborious.Tarantino perfectly balances brilliantly written dialogue with completely insane violence. I was pumping my fist in the air the entire time.Everything with Brad Pitt and The Basterds is awesome. The rest of the movie stinks.A nerve-jangling, suspenseful, violent, rollicking good time.As it progresses, it increasingly takes its cues from Ernst Lubitsch's great Nazi farce To Be or Not to Be, except eventually even wackier and less realistic.Gutsy, pleasurable and very satisfying. Packaged together by the amazing Quentin Tarantino, this film will slap you in the face and say: \"Damn good, what a way to end the summer!\"N\u0103o importando a qual g\u0119nero perten\u00e7am ou que hist\u00f3ria estejam contando, os filmes de Quentin Tarantino giram primordialmente em torno de duas coisas: o Cinema e o amor que o diretor sente por este.Hitler is introduced in a cape like a comic-book villain, so moral relativism clearly isn't part of the plan. With its intentionally brash rewriting of history, Inglourious Basterds is what Quentin Tarantino's back-half of Grindhouse should've been.It's great in parts.Simply Tarantino's best. A very intelligent script that combines war movie elements with some pointed observations about violence in movies and in society.Quentin Tarantino's dual loves of vengeance and cinema have never had a purer expression than the face of a Jewish cinematheque owner projected Oz-like onto the smoke of Nazis aflame.Un divertido disparate sobre tema serio que es, en definitiva, una celebraci\u00f3n y reivindicaci\u00f3n del cine como espect\u00e1culo. Gran trabajo del austriaco Christoph Waltz en el papel de Hans Landa.Tarantino's World War II epic is both bloody and talky.Tarantino's visual style and flare for the fantasy make for an intriguing and colorful World War II drama.Superbly acted and well constructed, each scene is paced to a chaotic climatic frenzy.The film might not be Tarantino's masterpiece but it is his most entertaining and exhilarating effort since Pulp Fiction.It's a Second World War fantasy made up of bits and pieces of Second World War movies and reassembled into a wordy pastiche that is irresistibly absurd. It's positively inglorious.A smart, sophisticated and perplexing blend of wisdom and attitude that takes bold risks, sneers at convention and then still has enough audacity to rewrite the history books for one last daring climax.In this film, WWII was settled in a movie theater -- a notion that obviously feels appropriate to anyone who loves old movies as much as this director.The intricate plot offers a wealth of opportunities for scene-stopping showpieces of all kinds, from epic spectacle to intimate character work.Personally, I wearied of Tarantino's breathless shtick long ago, but I must admit I enjoyed Inglourious Basterds more than anything he's done in years.Basterds has multiple plot strands that eventually converge in a spectacular finale, which takes place, fittingly, in a movie theater in Paris.It's a lot to take in. But in the end, Tarantino leaves you wanting more.Watching Tarantino pull out his filmmaking toys and play with each of them is a thrill.The dialogue is fabulous.Tarantino crams enough movie-loving passion into the film to keep you not just entertained but occasionally riveted. Above all else, it's a really enjoyable ride.With Inglourious Basterds, Quentin Tarantino has made his best movie since Pulp Fiction. He has also made what could arguably be considered the most audacious World War II movie of all-time.This is a seriously provocative film.This rollicking epic harks back to typical wordy Tarantino fare, with the added explicit violence that's to be expected from this cult director.Not enough scalps. While it's good and there are fun elements it's rather dialogue led than jam-packed with action.What I like most about Inglourious Basterds is its unpredictability.With its exploded notions of heroism, torture-rack dramatics and kamikaze gusto, it's a fiendishly entertaining flick.Watching WWII through the eyes of Quentin Tarantino is infinitely more fun than the real thing; the results are unforgettable.An accomplished work that can be partially described by its title, Inglourious Basterds is absolutely glorious.A brawny, rollicking mash-up that is a passionate exploration of the power of filmmaking from one of our finest directors and writers.Quentin Tarantino seems to be hanging on to a lost world of moviemaking. He may be nuts. But he's a nut who cares.One of the best films of 2009, and another home run for Tarantino.Quentin Tarantino's once blazing career continues to sputter thanks to his alternately brilliant and baffling Basterds.Revel in the Glourious-ness that is Inglourious Basterds, writer/director Quentin Tarantino's marvelously skewed take on WWII.Tarantino does not set out to make a war film like any one you have seen before. Instead, he's going for a genre mish-mash to deliver a unique film in and of itself.A delirious pastiche of WWII movie tropes via the naughty Nazi pictures that flooded Italy in The Night Porter's wake ... Tarantino knows exactly how vulgar it is to spin pulp entertainment from the iconography of mass murderers, and how bracinglyTarantino's scenes go on and on because he's in love with the sound of his character talking. This gets especially maddening in Inglorious Basterds because much of the dialogue is in German, so the words are three times as long.In this year of bland, boring, vision-less studio films Ingourious Basterds is a fun, inventive breath of fresh air that I just wanted to keep breathing in and hold as if my life depended on it.Tarantino assembles his complicated plot and multitude of players with only occasional allegiance to history. As a result, all bets are off, making the film and its twists harder to predict.Not only does it have all the Tarantino hallmarks -- crackling dialog, dark comedy, graphic violence -- but it's also got Brad Pitt and dead Nazis. Entertaining? Immensely.WWII revamped Quentin Tarantino style, Inglourious Basterds succeeds as the ultimate fantasy revenge story, a Kill Hitler which stands as one the best works in the career of its influential filmmaker.Dialogue is sharp, the imagery mesmerizing and both come together to create a wildly entertaining film. Impossible to watch without wanting to be a Basterd yourself.Despite some of the scenes dragging on too long, Inglourious Basterds is still a lot of fun, altering history for the better as the Nazis feel the force of redemption.Tarantino is at times like a flamboyant, egomaniacal orchestra conductor, gesticulating wildly and turning to the audience to make sure we know that the show's about him.Shows how most of us turn to film for both fantasy escape and an avenue to make the abstract past tangible, enough to even possibly, and powerfully, replace actual history.Inglourious Basterds is worthy of Dr. Strangelove.Pure Tarantino with the brash pop culture flourishes and disbelief suspension that entails, yet fine performances and memorable characters show real heart and thought behind Inglourious Basterds. I had a blast....rarely have I ever been as satisfied with a film as I was with this one...[but] you should know what you're going to see....heads are bashed in with baseball bats and people are brutally murdered. If that's not your thing...The film's real star is Christoph Waltz, who steals the show as Jekyll & Hyde inquisitor Hans Landa. He is a screwball menace, giggling one moment then strangling you the nextAustrian actor Christoph Waltz \u2028 triumphs, heroically, over Tarantino's brash, cine-drunk tall tale.Mr. Waltz's dynamic performance contrasts satirical and dramatic hues, effectively charismatic and repulsive at once.Inglourious Basterds is Quentin Tarantino's Crash.It's these fine sequences that can make you truly regret Tarantino's snarky, in-joke impulses, not to mention his arrogant -- perhaps even dangerous -- lack of concern with the story's moral dimensions.An amalgam of tension and frivolity and movie-love and wantonness and sleight-of-hand and mastery and glee.Landa is such a wily and despicable concoction that, in movie terms, he's almost impossible not to like. And therein lies part of my problem with this movie.I'm tempted to say Tarantino has done it again, but I doubt anyone has ever done anything like his dazzlingly original World War II movie, Inglourious Basterds.Inglorious Basterds is a meatier movie mash-up than his recent run of flicks, but it's still first and foremost a platform for Tarantino to indulge his very particular whims.What is not to like about dispatching armed and angry Jews to kill Nazis during the Second World War?Will Basterds polarize audiences? That's a given. But for anyone professing true movie love, there's no resisting it.Clocking in at 2 hours and 32 minutes, it is unforgivably leisurely, almost glacial, a film that loses its way in the thickets of alternative history and manages to be violent without the start-to-finish energy that violence on screen usually guarantees.May indeed be morally troublesome, but unlike, say, Death Proof, it's also fiendishly entertaining.It's a patient, layered, stupefying doozy of a motion picture. Once again Tarantino has come to bend the staples of cinema, and the results are characteristically spectacular.A well made film featuring one of the great performances of the year...The picture contains all the things his fans like about Tarantino -- the wit, the audacity, the sudden violence -- but this movie's emotional core and bigness of spirit are new.Quentin Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds is a big, bold, audacious war movie that will annoy some, startle others and demonstrate once again that he's the real thing, a director of quixotic delights.A celebration of film as its own entity, beholden to nothing but its own creative impulses.It's crazy, nasty fun, and pure unadulterated Tarantino.Effort still matters and originality is too damn scarce to lightly dismiss. Inglourious Basterds has plenty of both to spare.The movie's tone is dangerously close to triumphant, without the necessary satire or feeling to keep it from being smug and potentially offensive.They're inventing a new junk-food product line for Inglourious Basterds - the White Elephant Supreme.Like a bat to the head, it's not too subtle, but you can't help but watch.Although the actors are flawless, it is Tarantino whose name will go hand in hand with the film -- he is by the modern definition of the word an \"auteur.\"There is absolutely no one like Tarantino. I think he's capable of anything. It's almost too much power for one filmmaker to have.With Inglourious Basterds, he's managed to make a movie that will polarise more than ever; its lack of immediacy will frustrate casual audiences; its unfocused story will likely upset the QT hardcore.Tarantino devotes roughly equal time to discussing the cinema of G.W. Pabst and dramatizing the gory scalping of dead Nazi soldiers. It's just that kind of movie.Despite failing to achieve epic greatness (or moral relevance), Inglourius Basterds is a helluva cinematic experience, rewriting the fall of the Third Reich in a way few directors would ever dare.The experience is like savoring a box of imported French chocolates, only the last one is filled with the wrath of God.For all its originality, this hall of mirrors is the closest Tarantino has come to making a film with old-fashioned, movie-movie appeal.Waltz will be unknown to most American audiences -- he was certainly unknown to me -- but he's nothing less than sensational as the silky, polyglot SS officer charged by the Fuhrer to root out the remaining Jews in France.The film is long, certainly, but it's never dull; it's violent, of course, but hey, World War II was a violent business and war movies were never like this before.A two and half hour film made up of only a handful of beautifully crafted scenes. Superbly exagerated characters in high intensity moments. This is classic Tarantino.Something close to an ideal Tarantino flick, an impertinent and often tasteless epic that rewrites WII history as a fairy tale for gonzo genre kicks.Don't be put off by all the explicit gore, for it is ultimately vindicated by the flick's disturbing, self-referential way of delivering a thought-provoking message not only about war, but about our insatiable lust for movies about war.I think this is a key work in Tarantino's career, because it shows that he can pull off a masterpiece without resorting too much to his well-established bag of tricks.It's a lurid, wide-screen fantasy of how things might have gone if Sergio Leone or Sam Fuller had called the shots....an old-fashioned World War II movie showing war as fun adventure updated by graphic violence, abetted by Tarantino's chimerical speculation.This is the most fun I've had at the movies all year, and if you don't mind a little Nazi killin', you might just come out thinking the same.QT has let loose completely: flashes of cine-genius curdle with crude, crazy juvenility, although it doesn't stop this being his most purely enjoyable film since Kill Bill: Vol. 1.Landa is a man you will love to hate. His performance is a credible candidate for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar. He is the best thing in this patchy, overlong but ridiculously enjoyable return to form for the bad boy of American cinema.Tarantino's finest film since Pulp Fiction.Tarantino likes action, but more than anything he likes seeing actors delivering the dialogue he wrote for them. In the case of the surprising, original Inglourious Basterds, we are happy to indulge him.Basterds is not as the closing dialogue suggests, a masterpiece, but even an off-day Tarantino can still impose shock and awe.Inglourious Basterds not only knows that it is a fictional movie, but also that it is being watched by an audience, and herein lays its greatest achievement.Basterds isn't a deep film -- honestly, what Tarantino flick is? -- but it has moments as sharp as a bayonet and as perverse as war itself.Basterds is his fullest, richest and most complete novel. [Tarantino] presides over the tough material with the confidence of an artist who is done trying to impress everyone with gimmicks.For all its stylistic flourishes and interlocking storylines, Inglourious Basterds is, at its bullet-riddled core, a bloody good war movie, twisting and twisted and full of wordy shrapnel but no less kickass for it.an insane destruction of the war filmIs there another American filmmaker who takes such joy in telling stories and spinning cinematic spells as Quentin Tarantino?Inglourious Basterds is a social marker as startling as Easy Rider was in its day.It's so hollow and protracted that it transforms mayhem into monotony.Inglourious Basterds transcends the war genre to become its own kind of unique picture: A bloody blast of pure movie bliss.So long as you don't mind twisted history and elaborate riffs on genre convention, you should find that there's much to savor here, not least Waltz's magnetic villainy.Many Tarantino movies are female revenge fantasies, in which strong women plot the deaths of men who wronged them. In Shosanna and Bridget, the writer-director has fashioned two of his steeliest, most principled femmes fatales.Tarantino is the most fearlessly inventive filmmaker alive -- but we knew that. And while Inglourious Basterds is never anything less than ridiculously entertaining, it's nothing Tarantino hasn't done before.Quentin Tarantino has become the third Coen brother.It's a long but entertainingly showy melodrama full of cineaste jokes, tricksy wordplay and references to film-makers GW Pabst, Leni Riefenstahl and Sergio Leone.How does one do justice to a movie as warped, wacky and way out there as 'Inglourious Basterds'? Truth is, you can't. That's how glorious this bastardized version of World War II history becomes.A work that is experimental, offbeat, and most distinctly of a unique voice is a welcome rarity.Raises a host of fascinating questions about the nature of justice and vengeance, and how these things are understood in both the Jewish and Christian traditions.This film isn't about World War II, it's about World War II movies, as gleefully recounted by a giddy kid who's eaten way too much sugar.How welcome, then, that Basterds, while no masterpiece, manages to get at something more than its creator's too often frivolously exercised visual intelligence and esoteric preoccupations.A pretty good war movie that is audacious, occasionally fun and too in love with its own voice.The film's infamous ending offers Tarantino's most pronounced metaphor for cinema.Inglourious Basterds is naughty, apocalyptic fun -- Tarantino's version of a war movie, with history rewritten to avenge the guilty in ways that satisfy his pop-art cinephilia.Inglourious Basterds is almost as deliriously entertaining as a remixed Hitler tantrum.It's talky, foul-mouthed, over-the-top and probably too long by at least a half hour. However, those who enjoy Tarantino's brand of off-the-wall filmmaking and those who can withstand this film's constant assault on their sensibilities will be just fine.The outcome is gory and glorious.",

        "document": "Passionately humanistic as poetic, an urgent and timely portrait. . .of Sufi Muslim culture and everyday life antithetical to the extreme fundamentalist definition of Islam.A film that deliberately expresses its outrage with religious oppression, offering moments of humour and, at times, startling beauty.Jihadism is perpetually ablaze in the news, but the Mauritanian movie Timbuktu, a nominee for the best foreign film Oscar, gives those who suffer its condemnations a searingly human face.Sissako achieves the daunting task of humanizing the villains by playing on audience expectations and preconceptions.An emerging star in African and world cinema, [Sissako] is a talent every film lover should note.\"Timbuktu\" is culturally deep, visually ravishing, utterly heartbreaking work.There's no oasis to be found in this film's arid landscape. Peaceful co-existence is just a mirage.Timbuktu is a transfixing meditation on faith, occupation, and man's fallacies in the face of God. Abderrahmane Sissako presents an unnerving situation and elevates it into a fascinating microcosm.Rather than shock, Sissako envelops us in a heavy sadness as beauty and happiness is destroyed by the same species who had created it...A masterful and heartbreaking account of religion trumping humanity.A transcendent political poem as intellectually rigorous as it is beautiful.This is the clash of ancient and modern, of rulers and ruled, of rabid dogma and the joys of daily life. It is a portrait of the ugly folly of imposed ideology, a too-common condition for far too many.Well made, well told story, complete with humorThe film is a magnificent document of secular humanism.The performances are hushed and memorable. Cinematographer Sofian El Fanicaptures the beauty of this desert land. Amine Bouhafa's score is its own act of gorgeous grace and defiance.Wants us to slow down and think about what we're seeing.... a sharply observed yet sensitively rendered examination of patriarchal society and religious extremism that doesn't resort to heavy-handed political posturing.What sticks with you in writer-director Abderrahmane Sissako's devastating portrait of brutal, didactic rule is the indestructibility of the human spirit.A piercingly relevant study of life under the rule of Islamic jihadists.Even though the atrocities committed by radical jihadists dominate the headlines and airwaves, few in the West know what it's like to live under their reign. Timbuktu...is a moving, haunting and beautifully shot peek behind the closed cultural curtain.A lovely if sad story of contrasts one will not soon forget.... a better distillation of the struggle between freedom of expression and the urge to repress than any documentary collage of talking heads and archival footage could ever be ... a song of fury, a lyrical and forceful indictment of the enemies of joy.It is a film suffused with compassion as it celebrates the inner strength and quiet defiance of individuals at the mercy of a world where a shared humanity becomes the first casualty when intolerance and hatred take hold.Shot with a brilliant eye for composition by Sofian El Fani, Timbuktu is an essential work; it's a vital plea for understanding, compassion and peace that is marked by a deep wisdom and humanity.Sissako creates an interrelated series of characters and tableaux giving us scenes from the life of a traumatised nation.Exceptional human filmmaking.It has some of the same comic absurdism that ran through Chris Morris's Four Lions, but the satire is combined with lyricism and a sense of mounting tragedy.Abderrahmane Sissako watches as traditional life, in harmony with a beautiful landscape, is destroyed by the invaders' rules and Sharia....Sissako's film takes place on a simple, human scale that contrasts the absurdities of the militants' penchant for extreme and abstract values with the human scale of the villagers' lives.Director Abderrahmane Sissako, a Muslim from neighboring Mauritania, has made a movie that is worthy of comparisons on several levels to Terrence Malick's wheat-field tragedy \"Days of Heaven.\"Abderrahmane Sissako may not be the most prolific of filmmakers, but he is undoubtedly one of the most interesting and ambitious writer-directors working in film today, and quite possibly one of the best.Timbuktu inarguably stands on its own merits as a distinctive film told with both authenticity and artistry, that makes human and visceral the kind of stories that most Western eyes read only as news headlines, if that.The rebels are too flatly characterized for the religious conflict to deepen, and Sissako's other main story line, tracing a deadly feud between a fisherman and a cattle farmer, adds little to the movie's political thrust.It may approach the subject of religious fundamentalism in a somewhat passionless manner, but Timbuktu is still a thought-provoking, highly topical tale that surprisingly seeks to entertain as it educates.A spiritually powerful critique of Islamic fundamentalism and the havoc it causes in Timbuktu in 2012.Although the interlocking tales end in technical tragedy, there is yet a feeling that spirit will win out, like nature and the cycle of a gazelle that opens and closes.Timbuktu is frightening and frustrating viewing. You're watching the noose tighten over an entire town, and at times, it will cause you to gasp.The film's criticism isn't primarily rooted in satire, but rather in fury and condemnation for those who seek to be gods while shamefully feigning to follow and praise one god.It is a tragedy, yes, but a very human one, with an overall caustic, almost nihilistic absurdity running throughout.Sissako may be preaching to the converted here, but he does so with elegance, intelligence and beauty.Sissako, with a few blunt-force exceptions, usually refrains from showing violence, preferring to juxtapose cruel acts with poetic images.Timbuktu connects these disparate threads together with a poet's ease and a delightful grace.A breathing, bleeding response to a genuine human rights crisis that doesn't view tragedy as a zone exempt from beauty or humor.Sissako's precise, economic, style looks almost monastic, but unsurprisingly obtains a far more powerful effect.The release of \"Timbuktu\" could not be more timely, although the sad truth is that, nowadays, almost any time would do.In the hands of a master, indignation and tragedy can be rendered with clarity yet subtlety, setting hysteria aside for deeper, more richly shaded tones. Abderrahmane Sissako is just such a master.Timbuktu is a hard film to forget and once again brings Sissako to the center stage of African cinema.Sissako's vision is so offhandedly seductive, it's a while before you realise what a threat is gathering, and from where.Thoughtful, nightmarish, unblinking, and a most worthy Best Foreign Language Film Oscar nominee.Absurd? That's precisely the point of a film that sets up a dialectical opposition between Islam and fundamentalism. Absurd and bloody.An unflinching, quietly furious exploration of life under radical Islamist rule. It also makes a point about power that even nonextremist, democratically elected leaders would do well to keep in mind.A nuanced, humanistic portrait of a town besieged by jihadists, its images of violence suffused with almost surreal dreaminess.Through the filmmaker's poetic vision and rich grasp of the milieu, Timbuktu becomes politically perceptive and emotionally authentic, depicting visceral trauma without hysterics and eye-opening truths without didacticism.Even when the film tips over into violence, Sissako never denies the hostile occupiers their humanity, even when the traits they represent are jealousy, pettiness, and hypocrisy.It manages to ravish the heart while dazzling the eye simultaneously, neither at the expense of the other. It's a work of art that seems realized in an entirely organic way.Avoiding stereotypes, the movie shrinks larger political and religious battles down to the people of a desert town - city dwellers and nomadic Tuareg people out in the dunes - being forced to change by a handful of halfhearted oppressors.\"Timbuktu\" deserves every accolade it gets.The kind of mature polemical filmmaking that can't help but seem singular, because few political-issue-type directors try it, and even fewer get it right.Eye-opening but never didactic, Sissako's beautifully shot film immerses us in a reality we usually experience as no more than a headline.Sissako's gorgeous fourth feature reflects upon the role religion currently plays in Africa, and the foundational clash of cultures that shaped the continent.This unforgettable tragi-comedy shows a cross-section of ordinary Mali people trying to live normally while being harassed by swaggering jihadists toting Kalashnikov rifles.A film that's a mix of tones, of satire and melodrama and tragedy, that somehow jells.A movie about real people sinking into an abyss as unrelenting as the sand surrounding them. It offers no easy answers or hopeful pleas, but it demands to be seen.An extraordinary accomplishment, a heartbreaking, visually spectacular and largely accessible work from a cinematic master who is more than ready for international attention.The film throbs with humanity, and abounds in extraordinary images ...Not particularly useful to those who want good-vs.-evil 'moral clarity,' but it's useful to everyone else.A provocative, sometimes satiric drama about the sort of Islamic extremists who make life, especially in the outer reaches, so treacherous these days.[Sissako] has made a film of unforgettable anger, yet tempered his outrage with humor, compassion and visual poetry.Sissako captures his story with poetic precision rather than gritty realism. Each shot is deliberately composed, and the transitions to new scenes follow a unique rhythm.Timbuktu is bracingly original and unexpected-a welcome shock to the system for American moviegoers who've grown used to seeing prosaic melodrama in topical or torn-from-the-headline moviesThis is a film in which small pieces stand in for a daunting and horrifying whole.What we end up with is a film that adeptly meshes political anger with strong traditional narratives.A film that's guaranteed to resonate for years to come.Sissako's film offers a fearlessly poetic response to the jihadist occupation; its tone is never preachy and it is beautiful to watch.A mesmerizing political tone film of our times about intolerant Islamic fundamentalist taking control of a Muslim community in Timbuktu.The movie makes sure to never forget that these are all people, stupid, flawed people; the banality of evil is so prevalent here that you'll occasionally laugh just to keep from cry.What makes it so unusually compelling as a protest film is that it's also a richly poetic work of cinema - witty, beautiful and even, sobering though it is, highly entertaining.Visually surprising to all the surroundings..forcing us to see it from a new perspective and ignoring the routine and what is familiar.Seldom has a film about a subject as grim as this been so generous in its sympathy not just for the victims of a brutal system, but also the oppressors, often confused befuddled souls, who know not what they do.There are few filmmakers alive today wearing a mantle of moral authority comparable to that which Sissako has taken upon himself, and if his film has been met with an extraordinary amount of acclaim, it is because he manages to wear this mantle lightly.Timbuktu is an essential film for these medieval, 21st Century times.Dazzling and morally devastating ...\"Timbuktu\" is a terrific film, a quiet work of savage truth.In providing audiences a chance to bear witness to unspeakable suffering as well as dazzling defiance and human dignity, Sissako has created a film that's a privilege to watch.What daily life is like for locals living under the jihadist rule of insurgents: repressive, humiliating and too often tragic.Masterful...Abderrahmane Sissako's sad, handsome film is a response, a supplement, and a protest to the horrors that flash by on the news.The film's approach is meticulous and unwavering.Elegantly artful, maddeningly truthful.Terrible things happen in Timbuktu. There are also moments of striking poetry and subtle humour.",

        "document": "A film brimming with unexpected moments, bristling with creative energy and filled with humanity and compassion.These characters are sympathetic.It's an oddly affecting piece that manages to say something about isolation and loneliness in its own peculiar way.This is the good stuff you wade through years of outwardly similar dross to get to -- though its distinctiveness isn't immediately apparent.Here's a perfectly twee little romance all but smothered in a blanket of indie 'edge.'...July is playing on very dangerous ground here, making potential child molestation into comic plot points.If Todd Solondz were a humanist, he might make something like performance artist Miranda July's winning debut feature film.A charmingly odd movie about the adventure life has to offer, even in the form of department stores, hope chests and goldfish.An intriguing piece of humanistic cinema.So pure in its commitment to the world it has created, so fascinated by its bizarre characters and their idiosyncrasies and so wide-eyed and curious about life's possibilities that it is utterly unlike the work of any other filmmaker.July's suspiciously contrived awkwardness notwithstanding, the picture is at its best when it cleaves to her experimental video aesthetic; framing the mundane with the wonder of a child-like perspective.Much of this is far too precious - it's mostly for adults who impulsively put socks on their ears, as a character does here.This wobbly low fidelity romantic comedy is filled with distinctly unlikable characters and an unsubstantiated use of child sexuality that further clouds the film's morally rudderless course.breaks through its own whimsical stylisation to touch you in unexpected and mysterious ways.A clever screenwriter and inspired director, July takes us places no other filmmaker has ever visited.Precious with a capital 'P.'Micro budget, no-name cast, but a movie with boundless imagination.Me and You and Everyone We Know is as unexpected as life itself.With a film like Me and You and Everyone We Know there is much to talk about afterward, and half the fun is in its dissection.In a time in which the big screen is cluttered with retreads of old TV shows... July's film is an oasis of offbeat observations and provocative humor.The film conjures a heightened reality where characters verbalize their thoughts, desires, and impulses without submitting them to the usual filters first; July takes in their foibles unblinkingly and folds them into an awkward, heartfelt embrace.As in The Center of the World, July's focus is on people's deformed longing for human connection.July's handmade movie is so unique and so true to the artist's elementally feminine self, both in form and in content (it also picked up a batch of awards at Cannes), that it's impossible not to respond strongly to it.So strangely charming that you can't help but warm up to [Miranda July's] wonderfully odd view of the world...Performance artist Miranda July hits a grand slam as the writer, director and star of her first film.that rare first-time gem that does everything remarkably wellTruly independent, which is to say offbeat, daring, and the kind of offering Hollywood will never come close to embracing.At times funny, sinister, quirky and bittersweet, July's film is also obvious, contrived and too precious by far.Exceptionally Solondz-esque; incredibly impressive.Characterized by an ensemble of rich and delicious characters and witty, unexpected dialogue, July's script is also marked by a deep affection for children.Me and You and Everyone We Know is a real treasure in the guise of yet another Sundance dramedy (dare I say romantic comedy?) about quirky characters populating a quirky world.This first feature by multimedia performance artist Miranda July is a hit-and-miss affair. It has moments of unexpected, offbeat comedy, but most of the time neither the characters nor the situations engage the viewer.Me and You and Everyone We Know brings a fresh perspective to age-old human dilemmas: the longing of children to become adults, the yearning of adults to recapture the innocence of youth, and the difficulty of finding true love at age 7 or 70.There's a spell of magic and sense of wonderment in Miranda July's \"Me and You,\" the most original, charming, and visionary film at Sundance this year.The writer-director-star is so aggressively 'alternative' that she'll have the Gyllenhaals diving for cover, however her peculiar handle on humanity proves quite engaging.It seems quite possible that Me and You marks the arrival of an artist who may affect -- disturbingly yet helpfully -- films and audiences to come.The uneven romantic drama veers from raunchy comedy situations to making keen observations about desperate folks.An extremely enjoyable film that is by turns funny, moving and genuinely romantic.A journey from sexual innocence to youthful curiosity, middle-aged disconnection and finally death in the magical simultaneity of screen time.Life-affirming; a wonderfully serene treat of a film that you'd be sorry to miss.A terrarium of a movie, characterized by many charmed moments...a symptom of a gently transgressive spirit, a souvenir of an encounter with a playful spook.July's tender, original movie is a wonderfully uplifting experience.Click with it and there are elements to enjoy, but the title suggests a universal significance the film can't supply.Just as its calculated, self-conscious quirkiness threatens to become unbearable, the film suddenly pulls off a perfectly calibrated grace note so unexpected that it's almost breathtaking.How bearable you'll find [the film] has everything to do with your tolerance for stylized indie poetry, played mostly in a quirky, anesthetized deadpan.A strangely affecting and often very funny meditation on modern-day alienation.The dialogue is so contrived, the characters so self-consciously quirky that Me and You often feels like a parody of an indie movie.You laugh now and then, but mostly you smile -- at the simple connections people make, at the guileless screenplay, at the general tone of wonderment and love for mankind.Gorgeously loopy.Very personal, very funny vision of performance artist Miranda July.Miranda July's Me and You and Everyone We Know is a film that with quiet confidence creates a fragile magic.A wonderful filmNot just creepy and unsavory at such moments, but pleased to be so.Commercially, this IFC release is better suited for the IFC Channel.A graceful first step in what is sure to be a long and wonderfully imaginative evolution.While Miranda July's first feature film might be classified as romantic comedy, it introduces the playful qualities of installation art to the conventions of narrative cinema.The acting is marvelous, all the way down the line.A vanity project by a moderately talented artist that has moments of real brilliance in it.An effortlessly feel-good movie.proudly quirky and optimisticTakes a couple of neat swipes at the pretentiousness of the art scene, but as a commentary on the difficulty of connecting in contemporary society, it's too precious by half.A refreshingly original and touching film about the incredible loneliness of isolated individuals in this digital age of so-called connectedness.Many other characters also weave in and out of the story, which is sometimes sweet and ingenious, extremely explicit about adolescent sex. and occasionally too clever for its own good.July's tender view of these characters borders on the sentimental.Me and You and Everyone We Know brings a fresh perspective to age-old human dilemmas: the longing of children to become adults, the yearning of adults to recapture the innocence of youth, and the difficulty of finding true love at age 7 or 70.Set in a down-at-the-heels suburb that might be called Anywhere, America, the movie looks for connection in the oddest places, and, with an emotional impact out of all proportion to its gossamer touch, finds it.Refreshingly weird romance.In her roles as writer, director and star, July brings to the project a freshness of vision and tone that makes it feel as if nobody has done this sort of thing before.Totally original yet filled with familiar human frailties, Everyone leaps off the screen to become one of those rare movie-going experiences that linger in the part of the brain reserved for celluloid memories.An introspective, observant film with a deeply warped sense of humour.July's fertile imagination fills [the film] with incidents, many of which are charming and perceptive, some of which fall embarassingly flat.Hums with compassion for its outlandish, lonely but always sweet characters.... a playfully offbeat, willfully wide-eyed tale of lonely, inarticulate people looking for connection in a disconnected world.Delightfully light on its feet, suffused with a knowing humor that is more sweetly careworn than cynical.July's oddball vision grows on you, and I found myself looking forward to her next film.The sparks of brilliance littered throughout Miranda July's debut feature are just that\u0097sparks.It helps a great deal that the wispy, flower-like Miranda July appears in her own film, as her adorable, blue-eyed presence warms what would have been a cold... experience.Walks a thin line between sincerity and pretension, but ultimately deals with enough issues head-on to make the occassionally excessive quirkiness forgivable.Generally maintains a lovely humanism.Establishes a fragile tension that's both disquieting and hopeful but its poetic nature is abstract in the extreme.The debut film from performance art crossover Miranda July delivers an unlikely blend of irreverence and optimism. For all its dark humor and fringe qualities, the movie never descends into easy misanthropy.[T]ruly art: uncomfortable in the incisiveness of [its] observations, aggressively attuned to the ordinary...An original, elusive, heartfelt, funny-sad little movie that doesn't intend to change the world but kinda does.First-time feature director July's success has a great deal to do with her bold embrace of childhood and its gnarly truths.A film of indescribable and often unmentionable charm, Me and You and Everyone We Know is one of those completely unexpected artistic experiences, a work from an unknown with such a compelling, unique perspective that it boggles and inspires.Director Miranda July just might be the year's most exciting film discovery.It's funny, insightful, and makes you want to call up Miranda and say, 'Macaroni' (which means 'I get you').A comedy/drama that is unusually attuned to the halting, tentative way people connect with each other.Good builds, bad follow-throughs.July is a delightful discovery, as both a filmmaker and a performer.Although Me and You and Everyone We Know requires patience on the part of the viewer -- to get past the faux naivete of its grown-up characters, to get past its deadpan arty tone -- Miranda July's feature debut is worth the time.A film that bubbles with unique thought, trembling pain and immersive conversation.One leaves the theater grateful to have shared the time with these characters on-screen, but hoping we won't meet them in the lobby.Performance artist Miranda July has long trafficked in short pieces, and it shows: Her feature-length debut is packed with arresting images, moments, and single lines of dialogue.July, who also wrote the script, is a keenly observant filmmaker.It's a sturdy piece of writing wed to an utterly unique visual style.Frequently too sentimental and self-consciously adorable for my taste.July is without a doubt a brave new talent in the creatively beleaguered world of American cinema.For me and almost everyone I know, July's wispy film will only be a quirky diversion.A movie that's sweet without being sugary and quirky without being insufferable.A film that may take more than one viewing for its offbeat brilliance and tender sweetness to become fully apparent.July, who is staggeringly beautiful in a way that has more to do with Greek mythology than it does pop culture, has also sculpted a debut feature of astonishing, exquisite grace.Easily the year's most imaginative movie.",

        "document": "The rank pall of opportunism hangs over this sorry rogue enterprise from producer Kevin McClory, as he tries to assemble the component parts that make up a Bond movie and fails.ConneryBond gets worse as Sean gets older.Ah, yes, James, it is good to have you back again.Connery, Brandauer and Kim-sexy!Aside from some minor flaws, the film is a surprisingly standard Bond film, one that could easily be integrated into the \"official\" franchise with very few adjustments.Brandauer is a great Bond villain, and the role still fits Connery like an old tux.The action's good, the photography excellent, the sets decent; but the real clincher is the fact that Bond is once more played by a man with the right stuff.It's a major disappointment that, having lured back the original 007, the film makers couldn't offer him something better than this drawn-out, hackneyed story.As dull as dishwater.Never Say Never Again is the best acted Bond picture ever made, because it clearly surpasses any predecessors in the area of inventive and clever character delineation.It's not a rap against Roger Moore to say that this film seems to bring James Bond back to life. Sean Connery did, after all, define the character.Sean Connery is still up to par as James Bond in the latest adventure of Agent 007.The plot, which owes much to Thunderball, lurches badly at times, but the wild action set pieces, decked out in gals, gadgets and glib lines, are there to be cherished.A fitting farewell to 007's most enduring embodiment: as much a playful send-up as a loving final embrace.Can we just consider 1983 a lost year for James Bond? First, \"Octopussy,\" then Sean Connery's return in a depressing dilution of the 007 brand - one that ends with a fourth wall-breaking wink indicative less of arch fun, more of bored indifference.I know Bond fans were furious about this movie cause it wasn't an Eon production, and I think they're wrong. They should be furious at it because it's a horrendous film.The slick production values impress and Barbara Carrera and Klaus Maria Brandauer are good value villains, but Irvin Kershner appears to have nodded off in the director's chair.In Never Say Never Again, the formula is broadened to accommodate an older, seasoned man of much greater stature, and Mr. Connery expertly fills the bill.An ugly, unwanted epilogue [to Connery's Bond], in which the character who was so iconic and perfect is reduced to a self-conscious joke.After a 12-year hiatus, Sean Connery is back in action as James Bond. The new entry marks something of a retreat from the far-fetched technology of many of the later Bonds in favor of intrigue and romance.Like being trapped in a dream inside twin peaksIt's an aging and unenthusiastic Connery who returns to play Bond, who doesn't have the physicality to do justice any more to the demanding muscular role.Connery was perhaps wise to call it quits the first time round.There is a special place in movie hell for Never Say Never Again. Not that it's particularly bad -- though it's hardly good -- but because it's such a cheeseball experience with a strange and horrible pedigree.Connery proved plenty fit for one more outing...a likeable but somewhat mediocre adventure handsomely mounted in the traditional Bond style...[Blu-ray]Gone is the excessive gadgetry that mars Bond films, and, as a result, the characters are more prominent and colorful.It is good to see Connery's grave stylishness in this role again. It makes Bond's cynicism and opportunism seem the product of genuine worldliness (and world weariness) as opposed to Roger Moore's mere twirpishness.Connery has style, if not quite the energy quotient (he was 53 at the time) -- some nifty editing and a redundant dance routine make him look good.Without absolute conviction, no action film can survive: if there's no belief, there's no danger....one of the most sophisticated of the Bonds.Although this movie isn't perfect, it is good enough that you truly wish Connery had never said never again.The film's photography is pretty slick and the stuff in the Bahamas in particular has aged very well.",
        "summary": "While the rehashed story feels rather uninspired and unnecessary, the return of both Sean Connery and a more understated Bond make Never Say Never Again a watchable retread.",

        "document": "Wendy and Lucy is a short, sweet film with a premise as plain as they come: A girl and her dog drift into town.Dramatic arc is an elegant structure revealing the laws of emotional physicsIs Wendy and Lucy the Bicycle Thieves of the New Recession Cinema?I can't think of a more generous or humane filmmaker than Kelly Reichardt.Agonizingly slow-moving and it has a bare-bones plot in which nothing much happens.The very definition of a small film, Wendy and Lucy nonetheless packs some serious wallop thanks to a quietly extraordinary performance by Michelle Williams.Such is the resonant magic of Kelly Reichardt's remarkable little film, one of those exercises in minimalism where every word matters, every shot counts, until the kernel expands and a whole world emerges in 80 brief minutes.Even at 80 minutes, the film is like a short story that's a couple of pages too long. But the experience sticks with you, thanks largely to the actors.Wendy and Lucy, a minimalist character study starring Michelle Williams, is a deft, compact piece that makes every shot and moment count.Wendy and Lucy is a drama about loss. It's entirely character-driven, so not much of anything happens in the story, and yet it's a completely harrowing film.A spare and incredibly moving portrait of life on the fringes of contemporary AmericaKelly Reichardt's Wendy and Lucy is another illustration of how absorbing a film can be when the plot doesn't stand between us and a character.Whether she's warily cleaning up in a service-station restroom, or staring at the trains that offer a different travel option, or establishing her rapport with Lucy, Williams bravely explores the soul of a creature who's both gentle and determined.Given the woeful lack of inner life for young women in American movies, Williams's single gesture of fatigue and partial defeat in Wendy and Lucy is momentous.This is survival, revealed in all the blunt details of a documentary portrait and the simple power of [Michelle] Williams' unadorned, Oscar-worthy performance.Wendy and Lucy is a delicate and compassionate portrait of someone living precariously on the edge, and it asks us to respond to their predicament with kindness rather than indifference.Older audiences are hailing this slim story of a hand-to-mouth transient limping her way to Alaska as an insight into Gen X's unmoored ennui. It's like they've watched The Kite Runner and now think they understand Afghanistan.[Wendy's] story works on an empathetic, functional level, and it thankfully resists extreme turns of any kind, though that lack of distinction also contributes to the generalization of both her character and this particular scenario.You have to admire Wendy's determination to keep forging ahead, little by little, despite the seriously disappointing setbacks that keep coming her way.Like Reichardt, Williams does a lot with very little, culminating in a bittersweet, quietly moving finale.[Michelle] Williams delivers the goods and deserves the attention this fine role is getting.The movie, for all its morose impassivity, is beautiful and haunting.this quiet, unfussy film feels more important than a whole host of glossy blockbusters, raising urgent yet easily ignored questions about the often unforgiving economic environment of which everyone forms a part.The film is exquisitely realized, with a tremendous, naturalistic performance by Michelle Williams at its heart.Writing this review gave me more appreciation for the film as a work than I had while I was watching it. Perhaps it was intended to be more like a lovely poem or a painting.Paints a frequently affecting snapshot of a rudderless young woman in difficult straits, [though] its homespun approach never achieves a transcendent effect.Thanks to an extraordinary performance from Michelle Williams and an exceptionally deft hand from her director, this low-budget and loping little film is a genuine heartbreaker.Relentlessly solemn movies like Wendy and Lucy are why recession-plagued Americans paid $33 million last week to see Paul Blart, Mall Cop.Although the film itself is uneven and unresolved, there is no question that Michelle Williams delivers a career high performance as a desperate woman whose only companion is her faithful dog.Deliberately paced -- slow, even -- it's nevertheless an amazing, timely parable for increasingly desperate times.Williams's low-key, heartbreaking turn speaks volumes about the economic savagery of modern America, where even the companionship of a pet has a price beyond some people's means.Here's one movie that will make you want to go home and hug your dog.This sort of austere, elliptical portrait of the downtrodden owes much to the Italian neorealism made internationally famous by scriptwriter Cesare Zavattini and director Vittorio De Sica after World War II.Perfectly paced, with the many long silences you get in real life, Kelly Reichardt's film is undone by a fatal plot flaw involving the dog.Sensible people will see the film for what it is: Waiting for Dogot without Beckett... But you cannot argue with dog lovers: they see in a vacuum of nothingness an existential nirvana.Williams, with pageboy haircut and a martyrishly sad face, is quite lovely as this lost soul, while writer-director Kelly Reichardt catches something poignant in the windblown spaces of the American north-west.The story is told with a merciful lack of sentimentality, while Williams's performance seems totally natural. Added to that, Reichardt paints the smalltown scene with an attention to detail that a lot of other films miss.Superbly directed, brilliantly written and emotionally engaging drama with a terrific central performance from Michelle Williams.Kelly Reichardt's third film is another small story revolving around seemingly banal events which, like its predecessor Old Joy, builds into a moving cry of despair for its alienated lead character.One of those rare but keen pieces of art that engage and reflect the human condition with no apparent effort at all.A modest yet deeply felt road movie about an idealistic young drifter, her faithful canine and the wide-open spaces of the Pacific Northwest.After seeing these two films from Reichardt, I can't wait to see what she does next.It's easy to admire to Williams' performance, without ever feeling compelled to cry.Michelle Williams does her best but she cannot prevent Kelly Reichardt's Wendy and Lucy, a weak tale about being broke and on the road in rural America, from dwindling into boredom.A soulful tale of anomie in America.For all its virtues, Wendy and Lucy seems like the most overrated of art movies.A moment snatched from time, from a life coming from nowhere in particular, passing through interchangeable cities on a road map - and not bound for glory.A compassionate account of an enterprising young woman on her way to Alaska to find work who falls into peril due to a series of unforeseen circumstances beyond her control.Slow, ponderous, meticulously rendered realism that will appeal to specific audiences of slow, ponderous, meticulously rendered realism, with a heart.This is a low-budget movie with a limited release which deserves to be seen simply because it features one of America's best actresses on fine form.Nothing much happens in it, but it is still gently absorbing and oddly memorable.The classic indie-Sundance idiom of reticent performance, affectless dialogue, stonewashed colour photography and plain, sans-serif lettering on the credits.Wendy and Lucy is a sweet, slight and beautifully crafted film.This brilliant, desperately sad Steinbeckian fable from American director Kelly Reichardt. It's Reichardt's third full-length feature ('Old Joy' was in cinemas last year), but only her first masterpiece.Wendy and Lucy is quiet, deliberate filmmaking. See it knowing you will witness an idiosyncratic take on storytelling by a fundamentally independent filmmaker.The indie drama is a slow-motion exercise in economic frustration, as a young woman with already limited options sees her few choices evaporating around her.The current economic crisis has turned this fictional story of one woman's string of bad luck into a tale that seems real and relatable.Criminally overlooked this awards season, this modest indie is a treat.The simple construct yields such a rich world is a triumph, thanks in no small part to director Kelly Reichardt's hawk-like narrative focus and good casting sense.Wendy and Lucy is an old-school indie portrait of a woman in a desperate situation. It's quiet -- virtually silent in parts -- and at just 80 minutes, it makes its point without overstating it.Wendy and Lucy's minimalist aesthetic relaxes rather than taxes our awareness, allowing it to linger over minute details, which, in turn, become monumental developments.In happy sum, Reichardt is one more of the current American directors, most of them still young, who are endowing our film world with pleasure and hope.I expect there will be more stories like Wendy and Lucy's in the coming months and years. The wonder will be if they articulate their compassion and distress with such unforced eloquence.The climax is a heartbreaker, and in its haunting finale the movie recalls no less than Mervyn LeRoy's Depression-era classic I Am a Fugitive From a Chain Gang.It's a really simple story, but humanity, companionship and will power aren't that complicated either.Wendy and Lucy -- with its simple shots and edits and an elegantly musicless soundtrack -- proves you don't have to be flashy to be compelling.Wendy and Lucy is a little masterpiece about the painful realities of life among the have-nots during tough economic times.Wendy and Lucy refines Reichardt as a poet of the overlooked American working class.Even as Wendy's desperate situation magnifies every triumph and setback, Williams remains a remarkably grounded presence. It is quite likely the year's best screen acting.Decency is heartbreakingly trampled by strict, hard-nosed, boot-straps logic and the kind of hippie freedom nostalgia of movies like Easy Rider is quietly blown away like dust.Though it doesn't feature Old Joy's Air America radio call-in Greek chorus, Kelly Reichardt's follow-up Wendy and Lucy is nonetheless a somber politicized lament for hardscrabble lives struggling to exist on the economic precipice....slowly-but-surely grows on the viewer ...It's an arthouse Marley & Me, a one-woman/one-dog Grapes of Wrath and an Americanized Umberto D with a score comprised of Williams' occasional humming.The second coming of the Great Depression already has a version of The Grapes of Wrath.It's a quiet, undemonstrative movie but the points it makes go far, far beyond the breast-beating of more political film-makers.It is only marginally more absorbing than watching paint dry.Its effortless evocation of poverty's emotional brutality could hardly be more topical.It's easy to mistake the film's luxurious pacing and other minimalist filmmaking techniques for self-indulgence and navel-gazing introspection.The performance ranks right behind Melissa Leo's amazing thespian turn in \"Frozen River.\"Williams and Patton and the folks of this corner of Oregon serve up a slice of \"indie\" that, if it doesn't reach the level of \"inspires,\" at least feels timely and true.Wendy and Lucy is a film of small details and unassuming craftsmanship. It may be too slight for some, but if you let it get under your skin, it packs a devastating emotional coda.What comes across more powerfully is the sense of alienation and the simple tragedy of a human being whose only meaningful connection to the world comes through her friendship with an animal.Within the confines of this minimalist (with a microscopic m) picture, there are sequences so vital, timely and of-the-moment, so powerful and well-observed and precise, the effect can be emotionally overwhelming.Wendy And Lucy follows in noble traditions but steadfastly refuses to breach the poetry of its predecessors. Despite Michelle Williams's best efforts this is a very long, obvious, opaque 80 minutes.Told sparely and with deliberate pacing, it's a profoundly tender, deceptively simple story.'Wendy and Lucy' is the best feel-bad movie of the year.America is about to see a sharp upturn in hard-luck stories, which makes Kelly Reichardt's small-scale drama Wendy and Lucy sadly timely.A beautiful performance from Michelle Williams anchors this gentle examination of modern lifeIt's a resonant little mood piece that packs a great deal into a small compass.Williams is fascinating to watch on screen ... but a strong performance does not necessarily an entertaining movie make, and there seems to be little point or purpose to this.Keenly observational and quietly poignant, Wendy and Lucy is a personalized hymn to economic strife and the sort of everyday financial demands that keep one from getting the leg-up they need....timing with the current economic crisis makes Wendy's plight an Everyman's and the poignancy and fate of human kindnesses and transgressions make \"Wendy and Lucy\" feel like a Northwestern \"Umberto D.\"A prime specimen of American independent cinema.Modest but cosmic.Wendy and Lucy takes place mainly outdoors and registers the natural beauty of the Pacific Northwest with unostentatious affection.If you've ever lost a pet dog, or found yourself at the wrong end of an irreparably diminished bank account, Wendy And Lucy is the kind of film that will break your heart.For thoughtful filmgoers, this is a very timely and affecting study of what happens as one by one social props are stripped away and ties are broken.The narrative has been pared to the bone, and that was a problem for me. We know nothing about Wendy, who she really is, why she left Indiana, what she hopes to do in Alaska -- apart from find a job.Kelly Reichardt's devastating little film has attracted a lot of admiration since its debut at Cannes last year, partly because of its timeliness.This is not a saccharine, Marley & Me-type tale, but a wrenchingly ordinary story, emotionally manipulative in its own way -- I know my heart was in my throat -- about poverty in the land of plenty....an American Bicycle Thief, a simple, powerful film about the oppressive indignity of being poor in a wealthy country.[Williams] doesn't have to say much to convey the deep wells of hurt that Wendy's carrying around, and they're all the more poignant for remaining unspoken.A year from now it won't be a blip on my conscious mind. If someone mentions it to me, it'll register as 'oh, yeah, that depressing movie about the woman and her dog.'Like a worst-case-scenario, indie-movie clich\u00e9, Wendy and Lucy throws every bone it can at the screenExquisitely simple, this pearl of a film is an ode to freedom.The affecting, minimalist film Wendy and Lucy proves that small-town dramas aren't dead, but small towns, at least in the Mellencamp-idealist sense, are.An interesting film that needs the audience to serve as a mirror for Wendy's travails and emotions.Director Reichardt appears to owe a debt to the Dardenne brothers' similarly themed, Palme d'or-winning Rosetta, getting her intense effects from the point-of-view camera as much as from Williams's strong performance.A \"Grapes of Wrath\" for our age, even better than Ford's masterpiece in some ways since it disdains melodrama and delivers a more realistic view of the human condition under poverty and homelessness. A truly great movie.Wendy and Lucy is like Lassie Come Home directed by Antonioni.To her credit, Ms. Reichardt never allows her camera to become a voyeuristic witness to a young woman in distress. Instead, it remains focused on a largely indifferent American landscape of strangers in perpetual motion to nowhere.Michelle Williams memorably radiates an authentic, embattled humanity in Kelly Reichardt's tale of a girl and her dog.For all that the plot is minimal, it provides a non-judgmental look into the life of a woman who, while not undergoing a life-or-death ordeal, is facing something no less soul crushing.Everything about this small indie feels smart, just right, and well-acted.[A] thoroughly contemplative and reflective small scale feature. Tender and relentlessly subdued in its low-key poignancy...quaint yet [a] gut-wrenching narrative.With the right marketing Wendy and Lucy could find a small and dedicated arthouse audience that could turn this simple heart warmer into a modest box office hit.A car breaking down, a lost dog, a town with no jobs -- these are mundane points in a mundane America, but they are Wendy's world in its entirety, a floating world that we glimpse briefly before it moves on.If you liked \"Into the Wild\" you might have half a chance of getting into this extended melodrama. But beware, the story has none of the interesting characters and double the lameness.Reichardt seems to be challenging us to ask ourselves questions that the occluded, stricken, mysterious Wendy can't or won't ask. Questions like: How did we get here? And what do we do now?Wendy and Lucy is too laconic to be mistaken for a social drama, but it's set in a land whose harshness seems to a require a stronger critique than Reichardt's vignettes.It's a deceptively easy, effortlessly lovely film.Reichardt, working as she did in Old Joy from a short story by Jonathan Raymond, is unwilling (as she was in Old Joy) to either romanticize or condescend to her characters' self-willed marginality.The pace of real life is the rhythm that drives Reichardt's beautifully minimalist film.Kelly Reichardt spends the 75 minutes of Wendy and Lucy weaving an intimate, narrowly focused story of unanchored life on the road and just how tenuous such an existence is.Bruises while barely raising its voiceIf Wendy and Lucy isn't the most dynamic movie around, at least its tone and approach are sure-footed and appropriate.Wendy and Lucy gets under your nails, which is to say, it's the stuff of life.Reichardt serves her cause best when she forgoes the melodrama and focuses on the humanity, as well as the inhumanity, of the situation.Director co-writer Kelly Reichardt ... has fashioned a cautionary tale for the ages.Somewhere between a cautionary tale and a simple character study, Reichardt's film belongs to that part of all of us that finds hope on the other side of the horizon.Simple story, beautifully told.Though a less satisfying effort than Old Joy, Wendy and Lucy exhibits Reichardt and co-writer Jonathan Raymond's deftly subtle touch and both writers' compassionate take on how deeply poverty settles into their characters' bones.Reichardt is a gifted visual composer and a dream with actors, but a little from this filmmaker goes an awfully long way. Wendy steps further into Reichardt's cinematic meditation, yet shows her straining to reach lofty emotional goals.grim to the point of tediumSurprisingly gripping little movie about a drifter in a small Oregon town looking for her lost pooch, features Michelle Williams in a raw nerve of a performance.Turns the slimmest of narrative threads into a powerful meditation on the emotional cost of living.[With] very basic storytelling, we've got to be given a reason to care and it never happens.This indie film is slow and downright boring at its core.In a minimalist film of muted emotions, Michelle Williams gives as lovely a performance as a moviegoer could ask for. It's a portrait of a life going grievously wrong, or one that's never been right.Wendy and Lucy renews the spirit of American independent film. Its minimalism has a purpose, its sentiment seeks honest feeling when it could have been used for easy manipulation.Everyone who sees it is likely to remember it. It grows on you.It's difficult to think of a movie more relevant to this moment in American life than Wendy and Lucy. It's also difficult to think of a movie that more movingly conveys the plight of people caught in such a fix.Stark, heartbreaking and blunt in its notion that, even in these troubled times, sometimes the love of a four-legged best friend just isn't enough, Wendy and Lucy is a dog movie for grown-ups.None of this would work without Williams' painfully authentic performance. She plays Wendy as a gentle but self-possessed young woman who combats despair and fear with solemn defiance.Wendy and Lucy is the blues, pure and simple.The final scenes will tear your heart out, but perhaps not in the way you expect.Even when her character keeps her emotions firmly in check, Williams invests the role with heartfelt, heartbreaking feeling.Williams can hit the notes; she's slight, thin-legged, a serious waif. We can worry about her easily enough. The problem is that nothing sticks out more than poised acting in a naturalistic film.Evanescent and intangible, it dissolves into the air, leaving something tragic and mysterious behind.The film ends on a devastating farewell, but also imparts important empathy to Wendy: Although she's at the bottom of the barrel, there are those still inescapably trapped beneath its weight. This is the downbeat, dejected truth of pure pennilessness.Wendy and Lucy -- a film that might have seemed faintly academic six months ago -- becomes an anxious expression of its historical moment.In current times, the film's blank canvas and broadly sketched melancholic tones serve as an empty vessel for those who would like to turn the personal into the political.Wendy and Lucy is a glimpse at a portion of society rarely captured so eloquently or heartbreakingly on film. Don't miss it.For all its arthouse starkness, it packs a wallop. Michelle Williams' performance is incandescent.a small, spare, and genuinely beautiful film, very much the spiritual descendent of Italian neorealismDoesn't have any real surprises or insights and often drags, but at least it has a few heartfelt moments that leave you feeling quietly moved.Whether bad things are happening to Wendy or good, every one of them feels beautiful and human and true.The victories and insights gained in Wendy and Lucy are hard-won and small in stature, but they linger on the mind.If it was so simple to make, \"Wendy and Lucy\" wouldnt be the best American feature film of 2008. Which it is.It doesn't sound like much, but Reichardt and co-writer Jonathan Raymond create a loose universe in which the characters actually seem to be moving through time, waiting, making decisions, cursing fate, eating, sleeping and waiting some more.Breathtaking. With the sort of calm that only comes from the suppression of panic, Wendy and Lucy identifies the strength in weakness, and the weakness in strength.A quiet heartbreaker with a keen sense of the reality of lives like Wendy's.Reichardt, who directed Old Joy, doesn't so much tell a story as paint a finely detailed portrait of human suffering in this miniature marvel.[Director] Reichardt has an excellent sense of proportion: She doesn't try to do too much, but what she does do is fully realized. Animal-lovers are hereby advised to bring the Kleenex.America is full of people like Wendy Carroll, the young woman at the center of director Kelly Reichardt's small, supple new film Wendy and Lucy.Wendy and Lucy is a slow and meandering film, in no rush to get anywhere, least of all to anywhere important.Calling Wendy and Lucy spare is a monument to understatement. It's a drab, low-budget, unadorned film, often lacking the requisite elements that lend movies their motion: plot, conflict, character development, or even a soundtrack.Even at 80 minutes, this feels like a Chihuahua padded out to Great Dane proportions. It's far too hangdog to find much of an audience.As much as you can quibble about how the message is delivered, Reichardt never fails to get it across.The film works powerfully as both a wrenching character study and a mournful commentary on the economic desperation of rural Americans.With quirky support from Will Patton's caustic mechanic and Walter Dalton's sympathetic security guard, this is a bittersweet triumph.Michelle Williams is in every scene of Wendy and Lucy, and ably carries that burden -- with her dark pixie haircut and cut-offs, she looks frighteningly vulnerable, an indie urchin stuck in circumstances both dire and mundane.Coming from any other filmmaker, Wendy and Lucy's relatively clear-eyed and unsentimental tale of woe might be considered a minor triumph, but from one of Reichardt's unique talents, it is something of a letdown.Beautifully painful.Wendy serves as both detailed portrait and metaphorical expanse. Her pain is specific but also vague, her loss exact and all-encompassing.Reichardt does her best to make the grim story feel organic, bringing a muted, hypnotic stillness echoed by her marquee star. But given our nation's woes, it's likely viewers will cut Wendy and Lucy the teensiest bit of slack that it needs.",

Rather, by showing behavior, the film gets at the emotional truth that underlies it.thoughtful, serious, and compellingAn airlessly insular film, with too much concentration on minute details.Full of writer/director Fran\u00e7ois Ozon's lightly perverse touches and skewed vision of humanity, and all the more emotionally engaging because of it.Performed so straightforwardly, so seriously, and its characters are shown to be so intelligent, that it never seems a freakish supernatural tale.At the age of 33, Ozon has made a film with insights and compassion one might more reasonably expect from a director twice his age.It's Rampling's wonderful performance, walking a thin line between hope and delusion, that gives the film its fundamental essence.I loved the subversive nature frosting Ozon's other films, I found myself scratching my head after Under the Sand.Charlotte Rampling's performance, alone, is worth the price of admission...This beguiling film ... is blessed with a wonderfully complex performance by Charlotte Rampling.A compelling anatomy of grief as a solo journey through sorrow.This is a mournful, moving piece of filmic poetry.Rampling, working in French, remarkably delivers what is perhaps her deepest, most effortlessly nuanced performance.The acting is tremendous.Ozon ... displays a rare talent for being able to reveal life's interiority in unusually palpable terms.It crawls under the skin by placing you firmly in the shoes of the mourner.Where Rampling really bares herself is in the emotional revelations and rawness she delivers in just about every screen.Characters will do or say something that seems inexplicable until Ozon provides a context, and suddenly it all makes sense.An absorbing, visually poetic portrait of one woman's subconscious refusal to come to grips with loss and grief.Ozon shoots it all with such haunting economy and breathless intimacy, and Rampling acts it with such candor and recklessness, that the film keeps lingering in your mind after you see it.Ozon's sensitive and imaginative handling of the story is matched by Charlotte Rampling's deeply melancholic and vulnerable performance.Astute and penetrating.Under The Sand is vaguely disturbing, in an emotional sense, at all times.Under The Sand lifts the phantom-spouse syndrome to the level of art, yet another dimension for this popular form.A beautiful and challenging film.Charlotte Rampling is delightfully sincere and believable in her subtle performance.The film takes you slowly and confidently to the labyrinth of denial that often accompanies horrific loss.A stately and reticent portrait of arrived-at bereavement... and the capacity for self-delusion [anchored by] the beautiful and talented Rampling, enjoying her largest, most interesting role in some years.A measured yet deeply enthralling character study of loss and loyalty.Quando o filme chega ao fim, podemos at\u00e9 n\u0103o saber muito mais sobre o desaparecimento de Jean, mas certamente nos aprofundamos na complexa psiqu\u00e9 de sua esposa.Rampling carries Under the Sand with her assured turn as the dolefully loyal Marie.Though flawed, this is a mature discussion of loss, denial and sanity that engages both the audience's heart and its head.... this picture demands (and rewards) close study ...Instead of being intriguing, this art house snoozer just becomes tedious.A quiet, oblique, and finally mesmerizing work of psychological incision.A delicate and devastating film.Ozon may not be the next Truffaut -- not yet, anyway -- but he shows a deft touch here.A deliberately and gracefully ambiguous movie.An effective and moving account of the power of grief and denial.A wonderfully acted psychological study of a woman whose husband goes for a swim and disappears.Marie increasingly appears like the beach in the film: beautiful but vacant.Pairs the psycho-sexual oceanographics of Ozon's \"See the Sea\" with the emotional turbulence of Liv Ullman's \"Faithless.\" And Charlotte Rampling is simply stunning.An authentic study of loyalty and loss.Quietly haunting.Rampling has never been as beautiful, not to mention as emotionally naked, nuanced, and affecting as she is here.\"Under the Sand\" is best seen as a showcase for a fine actress at the height of her capabilities.A full-bodied, gripping film about the nature of trauma, memory and moving on.Rampling continues to reinvent sexual desire.Rampling shows a veteran's craftsmanship in evoking her patented compound of icy reserve and skittish disquietude.Ozon gives the movie to Ms. Rampling, whose performance is like a perfectly executed piano \u00e9tude.A sensitive and subtle meditation on aging, loss and bereavement.Rampling is superb as a woman pushed to the edge of madness by grief.Both of these Ozon films can do what few directors have mastered. They can make us feel exactly what the director intends, without overt or obvious cues.Each of the elements in Under the Sand is beautifully integrated and each in support of what is essentially an extended aria of loss and devotion.As long as you don't mind the lack of unsettling content, viewers should find the film to be an interesting story with a terrific lead performance.It's what we don't see -- what goes on inside the head of a middle-aged female university professor -- that makes this methodical, meditative drama about grief and denial so seductive.Evocative and resonating with pain and hopeOverall, Sand is alive to the senses.[Rampling] provides us with moments that you won't easily shake.Charlotte Rampling, given the chance to portray an older, yet still sexual, woman runs with itWhile ultimately the picture is somewhat frustrating as simple narrative, Rampling's extraordinary performance makes it a powerful depiction of grief.As the film exposes the haunted frailty beneath bourgeois exteriors, Under the Sand marks the advance of Ozon from promising auteur to artful interpreter of the human condition.A stark and surreal, non-literal and non-linear journey through the sand dunes of loss and denial.",

        "document": "Diaz's game charms are semi-squandered on a script that's two-thirds filler. Not quite detention, but on thin ice.It's brisk, puerile fun with added charm thanks to the game cast. A bit like watching your teachers make twits of themselves.Where the screenplay mostly falters is populating the school with unproductive supporting characters.Screenwriters Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg fare better here than with their first film, \"Year One.\" But like I said in my review of that film, if these guys are truly penning \"Ghostbusters III,\" they have a lot to learn.Diaz has a girlish charm that means she gets away with a series of cynical pranks, even though she's not quite as big and clever as she thinks she is.Cameron Diaz eats the screen in Bad Teacher and the screen says \"thank you\".Kasdan bundles together a mishmash of high-school movie clich\u00e9s and off-colour toilet humour, with the flimsy plot and faltering pace providing far too few laughs.Broader than Bad Santa and less consistently funny, it's still gleefully rude, crude and often a lot of fun.\"Bad Teacher\" immediately brings \"Bad Santa\" to mind and suffers by the comparison.Bad Teacher is more like a rebellious teen acting out against her parents than a truly rotten to the core degenerate kid. I guess you could say it's Kim Kardashian instead of being Lindsay Lohan.A fitfully amusing comedy that promises far more outrageousness than it actually delivers.There's a dark, acid-tongued comedy to be made from this premise with these characters, but this bland \"Teacher\" just isn't bad enough.If you've never seen Bad News Bears, Bad Santa, or one of a dozen other better movies about adults being mean to kids, maybe you'll think this is funny.Cameron Diaz is the reason charter schools exist.Diaz performs with gusto, but the screenplay doesn't give her many funny things to say.Diaz is absolutely fearless in portraying a character with almost no redeeming features.A high-school satire that is reasonably funny, though far from sure how badass it really wants to be.A disappointing, surprisingly unfunny comedy that fails thanks to a lazy, poorly structured plot, an uneven tone and a refusal to commit to its basic premise.Diaz shows off her comedy chops, displaying the kind of sunny charisma (despite the hangovers) that has charmed audiences since There's Something About Mary.If you can see past the dismal sexual politics of \"Bad Teacher,\" which I couldn't, you might applaud the gall of a film that expends so little effort in forcing us to like its central character.Bad Teacher should be held back for bad comedy. It's the kind of movie that after the first ten minutes, one decides whether to leave or stay hoping for one or two chuckles that might come.Provided you're in the mood for salacious fare, this titillating teensploit does deliver the requisite number of raunchy rib ticklers to be worth the investment for the testosterone-driven demographic.A great supporting cast isn't enough since Diaz and Timberlake just aren't funny.Both Bad Santa and the Bad Lieutenants (Keitel and Cage) were really bad, but they were entertaining. Cameron Diaz's Bad Teacher, Elizabeth, is neither.This is a case of a movie not being \"bad\" enough to be good.Joins the depressingly long list of movies that are simply hard to get worked up about one way or the other.If its master plot is utterly predictable, the way it unfolds is unapologetically cartoony and weird.Its trash-can humor is tasteless, no doubt, but hey, that doesn't make it unpalatable.Would 'Bridesmaids' have worked if audiences had been asked to sympathize with a meaner version of Rose Byrne and root against Kristen Wiig?Ms. Diaz has found her down-and-dirty element in the kind of broad comedy that threatens to get ugly and more or less succeeds on that threat.A nice idea poorly executed, underpinned by a script with too few laughs and an unsympathetic heroine.Makes a homecoming bonfire out of schoolroom pieties and drags heroic-educator yarns into the boy's bathroom for a swirlie.Bad Teacher isn't slick enough to make the grade. Diaz gets a gold star for effort, but it's Punch's chipper Miss Squirrel, as bushy-tailed as her namesake, who steals the film.And you thought Santa was bad....a failure of dishearteningly monumental proportions...Diaz manages to make Bad Teacher much more enjoyable than its mediocre script deservesFalls down is in its flippant approach to an idea that doesn't have any traction beyond a TV skit, about a morally bankrupt teacher in high heels trying to pay her way to a boob jobCompletely unfunny and utterly unpleasant.Ultimately, Bad Teacher is easy to like precisely because it doesn't try very hard to be liked.Attitude divorced from any insight or even coherence, mere posturing at best.I was wary going in, as I tend to be whenever a Hollywood movie announces through its advertising how \"outrageous\" it's going to be. The only outrageous thing about Bad Teacher is that director Jake Kasdan and two writers who earned an...Has every opportunity to turn mawkish but stays pitch black instead.The one element of Bad Teacher that's consistently strong throughout is Diaz's ferocious star turn.This film strains so badly to be a black comedy that it does itself an injury.Twenty minutes in, you'll begin to feel like you're in detention.It's a basic but amusing farce gifted with enough sharp lines to carry you through the lean patches.It's worth a look alone to see ex-real-life partners Diaz and Timberlake's former favourite sex position re-enacted - or just for Diaz in all her glory ...Bad Teacher could have dared to push the 15-rating further, and it probably would have been funnier as a result, but on the back of a refreshingly irreverent turn from Cameron Diaz, the flaws are easy to forgive.The film's main stock-in-trade is the kind of faintly bizarre, offbeat gags that you might find in a decent US sitcom - which is no bad thing and also makes sense given the writers' Office pedigree.A character so unpleasant and so self-centered, you watch her with the same repelled fascination usually aimed at a rattlesnake.The acting is uniformly on the button, but the script is patchier.It feels like Bad Teacher is crossing a line, and not just by a toe but hurdling all the way across. Good for everybody involved.Without more consistent laughs, the satire curdles on contact, removing the whole point of the character's bad behavior in the first place.It's a great idea, however the execution's not very impressive.Once again, the Judd Apatow-influenced school of witless comedy reinforces that we should bust a gut laughing at virtually the lowest of low humor. This is funny? No.Even though the picture is far from perfect, I was never less than amused. The terrific cast and some individual bits of comedy were enough to keep me invested.This is the type of story that would prompt a teacher to demand better character development, a stronger conflict and a bigger climax. If I had to give it a grade? A shaky C, and that is being generous.... more a succession of increasingly salacious sketches, most capped by Diaz dropping the f-bomb. Indeed, Diaz may establish some kind of record for onscreen profanity by an actress.Hard to root for such a selfish lead, but \"Bad Teacher\" has just enough politically incorrect humor to warrant a grade of B.When it hits, like a hysterically raunchy dry humping scene, Bad Teacher is a funny overachiever, though with a bit more effort it could've have won gold stars.If you're looking for a funny comedy about a cynical, hard-partying school teacher transformed by his students into a paragon of pedagogical awesomeness, skip Bad Teacher and go rent School of Rock instead.Cameron Diaz looks like she's having a blast in her best role in years.It's not often a movie features a cast of characters with absolutely no redeeming qualities, but \"Bad Teacher\" really hits that one out of the park.Kadan's direction is adequate with everything competently done, but there's nothing here that manages to make you laugh out loud. Could someone tell the current crop of Hollywood filmmakers to find some new jokes?The problem isn't that Diaz's character is such a mean-spirited person, it's that her motives for being that way are completely contrived.It might have been a good short film, but that's about it.In the end, despite how thinly-plotted the film is, there are several laughs to be had, and that goes a long way.Bad Teacher doesn't quite get an F. But an acceptable C+ is pretty fair.A raunchy comedy that promises, from its title to its casting, a \"Bad Santa\" riff on a sacred institution...But they don't deliver.Crass, charmless and not especially funny, Bad Teacher is like a school kid trying to be cool.A raunchy unpleasant comedy that wastes its talented cast.Cameron Diaz eats the screen up in Bad Teacher but can't withstand the enormously dim-witted script.Tries too hard, and seems inanely pleased with its own not very dirty jokes.[S]ucceeds due to the sheer determination of its towering lead performance... Diaz and her supporting cast routinely spin gold out of innocuous moments with blunt force dialogue delivery and physical determination.Lift the bonnet, unfortunately, and this movie's engine is too sputtering and feeble to get it anywhere.[The] film asks us to identify with a woman who behaves rather heinously, while it relies on her mean-spiritedly outrageous behavior to sustain all 92 minutes.It's no Bad Santa, but Bad Teacher brings just enough naughty behavior to the table to make it a decent watch for viewers tired of PG-13 timidity.Foul - and not even funny.While there are problems with ... a failure to maintain a consistent tone, Diaz is never less than exhilarating in a guilty pleasure way, even when hunched over her desk with an expression of glazed, disheveled contempt. Actually, especially then.Never fully clicks because the anti-hero protagonist never really becomes a sympathetic figure even when she sort of redeems herself.Bad Teacher gets a shiny new apple thanks to a raunchy turn by DiazA frustrating mix of smart flash and smirking impudence.Because the plot is thin and preposterous, the success of \"Bad Teacher\" depends on the performances of the cast. This is where things get ugly.Kasdan and company miss the opportunity to connect Elizabeth's venality to the greed and materialism that her pop consumer students absorb daily.Sure, Diaz' character doesn't undergo some clich\u00e9d redemption, but she doesn't evolve in any other way, either.The classroom comedy \"Bad Teacher\" could have been sent to detention for copying off of \"Bad Santa,\" but it's brazenly funny in its own right - until it turns into a goody two-shoes.For a one joke movie Bad Teacher plays a lot of attention to details.This movie is what you do when you have never been to school or don't like education. Or movies, comedies, women, breasts, sex, or dodgeball.\"Bad Teacher\" keeps threatening to become entertaining without quite getting there, but it took me a while to realize how truly awful it is.Barely makes the grade in either humor or provocation.a jolly, joke-filled escapeIn an era when schools are scandal zones, it's disappointing how timid a movie called Bad Teacher turns out to be... This movie needs more crassness in the classroom.Bad Teacher is hardly a perfect picture, but in the context of every other comedy on the summer movie landscape - from the faux empowerment of Bridesmaids to the neurotic frat-guy heteromania of The Hangover Part II - it feels revolutionary.Bad Teacher is a promising concept in need of more promising material.Diaz is funny, all right, but she is no miracle worker, so she can't erase the movie's slow spots or make it feel shorter than its 92-minute running time (it feels much, much longer, never a good sign for a comedy).This fitfully funny but mostly dull misfire defines exactly where the line can be drawn between truly subversive humor and lazy cynicism.As film school assignments go, Bad Teacher is a potentially \"A\" topic with a \"C\" result that would require considerable remedial writing to upgrade.The film is fast and often funny. And while it's not for children - really - I bet the adults who just spent a school year with them are going to love it.Yes, the plot is lacking but it is the lack of any socially redeeming qualities makes Cameron Diaz Bad Teacher as seductive to us as she is to Diaz.Although you should be prepared for its raunchiness, it starts off as brightly as Matilda on steroids.You'll be hot for Hot TeacherThere are just enough laughs in this movie to almost make you forget that there's very little supporting them.Has no appreciable arc for any of the characters and if it wasn't for the work of Jason Segel who appears to have shown up with his own script, this would have been an even more brutal affair.Bad Teacher is, for the most part, pretty good.Cameron Diaz is now officially on my roster of Hot Talented Actresses Who Should Stop Being in Romantic Comedies So Much.\"Bad Teacher\" is a pulled punch, a pot-smoking/kid cussing/teacher copulating farce that is less than the sum of its parts.Sets back feminism a few centuries, but who cares. Because if we're talking self-criticism of the species, some women are let's face it, what can only be termed female chauvinists. And Diaz reinforces every single negative female stereotype with relish.Surprisingly likable for a movie populated exclusively by idiots and jerks.Content to beat the same three jokes into a meaty paste, trusting Diaz's appearance will keep eyes on the screen while the film's winded sense of humor is swiftly choked out, never to recover.Though sporadically funny, this blackish comedy would have been far better had it been a lot darker...settles for sitcom-level shenanigans and mild raunchiness before coasting into an ending that effectively cops out.Bad teacher, worse movie...this summer comedy is an underachiever that should have been held back.The concept titillates - an oversexed, drug-abusing, foul-mouthed, doesn't-give-a-s--- woman put in charge of a classroom - but the result is drab, obvious, and disappointing.Bad Teacher isn't subtle in its \"borrowing\" from its clear inspiration, but it is savvy.Kasdan and writers Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg construct the film as a series of set pieces, some funnier than others.Bad Teacher isn't really bad enough. The R-rated elements don't jibe with the otherwise PG-13 tone of the film.Filthy and unredeeming in all of the right ways, Bad Teacher is a worthy successor to the benchmark black comedy Bad Santa (without being at all the same).Are actresses like Diaz and Punch really cool with punishing material based on the worst male-invented stereotypes of the way women deceptively control men and compete with one another?Bad Teacher delivers a watchable comic performance from Diaz - including a charity school car wash in denim hot pants - and some real laughs.[A] refreshing breath of just-so-wrongness... [T]he [sly], overarching joke that this is not, in fact, an attempt to outgross the grossouts... but is instead a parody of romantic comedies.The movie's nods to the bare-bones economics of educators' lives are subversive and admirable.Diaz has the sass and confidence to make the character funny, even when the material is inconsistent..There are worse ways to spend your time.A labored comedy.It doesn't quite go all the way into dark comedy but it's unapologetically cynical and that makes for good laughs.Its comic rhythms are out of whack, and sloppy continuity and unfilled story blanks suggest ample post-production surgery on a pic that commenced shooting more than a year ago.It's probably a coincidence that two of our most beautiful and sexiest stars (Julia Roberts is the other, in Larry Crowne) play foul-mouthed, heavy drinking teachers in high- concept comedies.The best lines were harvested for the trailer -- so if you've seen that, you've seen it all.Everyone loves an anti-hero, but usually there's something redeeming about the character that makes you want to root for them in the end. Not so much in Bad Teacher.Shame the flick's just a one-note joke because, sight unseen, Bad Teacher had me at the title.Diaz, always a deft comic, makes the most as this potty-mouthed party girl whose age is bearing down on her.I've always liked Cameron Diaz, who brings a spark to every part she plays, but she's only as good as her material, and Bad Teacher is bad news for her and her fans. I was wary going in, as I tend to be whenever a Hollywood movie announces through its...There are plenty of quality gags seeping through from the margins.Has its lewd funniness, though not often enough to make it worthy of not only Bad Santa but, more to the point, School of Rock.Diaz lets her wardrobe and bad attitude do the work for her, but she's left high and dry at the end of the film when it abruptly tries to redeem Elizabeth's bad behavior.A comedy that wants us to cheer for a nasty and self-absorbed teacher who breaks all the rules.Raunchy Diaz, Timberlake comedy aims low, misses the target.Simply serves Hollywood formula, while pretending to be above it.Although the script could be better, this is still a fairly entertaining film.\"Bad Teacher\" is exactly the one-joke movie that you probably expect it to be, but there are enough variations and shadings of that one joke to sustain its brief running time -- just barely.By no means terrible or unbearable, though it's slightly disappointing after the brilliance of Kasdan's previous movie.We're not on Elizabeth's side, or anyone else's, really. We're just watching a film try to pass off misanthropic blunt-wittedness as ''edge.''A refreshingly raucous comedy that comes surprisingly close to completely living up to its lack of conviction...A brainless comedy to escape from the grind.[VIDEO] For the first time since her unforgettable appearance in the Farrelly Brothers' 1998 gross out comedy \"There's Something About Mary\" Cameron Diaz fulfills her comedic promise.An amusing but wholly forgettable assemblage of scenes, some very funny, others thankfully brief, that you should absolutely catch bits of when it is on cable.Vainly strives for outrageousness via dry-humping, nude-pic blackmail scams, and desperate cracks about blacks, Jews, and \"Orientals.\"Diaz, costars Jason Segel and Justin Timberlake, and a sharp supporting cast (Lucy Punch, Phyllis Smith, Thomas Lennon, John Michael Higgins) manage to deliver a crappy good time, mercifully devoid of any heart-tugging teacher-student subplots.Have talented actors ever struggled so much to so little avail? Ms. Diaz sells her lines like a street vendor peddling fake Timexes.Having decided not to risk offending us, it could at least work a little harder to earn our affection.This puerile exercise in bad taste has all the appeal of a bratty child trying to shock the dinner table by uttering some mild profanity.Diaz's Bad Teacher might not give an F, but just about scrapes a B- herself.It's a comedy tour-de-force from Diaz, backed up by great performances all round.It's good for a few laughs but in the end neither outrageous nor accurate enough.This is one of those comedies that terribly misjudges the reverse appeal of its central character.While 'Bad Teacher' offers a few laughs here and there, it's far from the head of its class of raunchy, R-rated comedies.(Full Content Parental Review Also Available)When the end arrives at the 89-minute mark the immediate reaction is that it was too slight by a half and a lot safer than expected.There's so much wrong with the basic setup of [the film] that it never really gets a chance to be as funny as it could be.Viewers sick of being force-fed inspirational lessons who are looking to mentally flip the bird at authority, this will hit the spot.The film's rhythms are disjointed, and there are tedious patches and gaping holes in the story. No one bothered to create anything beyond a vague outline of a superficial character.Are you a fan of comedy based on the sole premise that it is funny to see a beautiful woman make outrageously crude and narcissistic statements? Go watch Sara Silverman.It provides a compact runtime (oh, how I've missed you, 90-minute movie) and a quality laughs/minute ratio.The picture doesn't inspire or reward high expectations, but it raises smiles.The main problem is that Hollywood finds it next to impossible to break out of the mold of the \"likeable\" characters.We're more concerned with the mock-shock screenplay futilely in search of a story, and the characters that could have been created on an Etch A Sketch.The ill-shaped script is an affront to the gods of plausibility.ena biastiko kai xiliopathmeno trabhgmeno sxoini kwmikoy romantzoy, panw sto opoio prepei na balei prwtagwnistria kai yposthriktikoys ermhneytes na kanoyn akrobatika gia na gemisei h eytyxws syntomh diarkeia toy panhgyrioy toyGross-out comedy big on cheap laughs, short on depthThe story is predictably thin and the jokes suitably unsophisticated, but the clever characterisations help this paint-by-numbers comedy limp over the line to \"watchable\".Weirdly ill-conceived. Diaz is good and very believable as ... the most dislikable character I've encountered in a film in a long time ... [which] makes for a lousy movie.The only way to understand this movie's argument about performance pay is to imagine Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker watching it.She's not somewhat bad, she's not repentantly bad and she's certainly not sympathetically bad. Nope, she's just plain ol' bad. And that is a thing of rare beauty.... more interesting (albeit disheartening) for what it seems to say about public-school teachers ...This is too easy, but I'm going to do it anyway: Bad Teacher? Bad movie.Somehow, surprisingly, without things ever turning schmaltzy, we end up caring about this selfish, foul-mouthed teacher, even if it's just a smidgen. And in hindsight, that's a pretty impressive feat.While a few of Diaz's scenes with Timberlake and his gift for the deadpan seem as if they're going to amount to something, the script's dialogue fails them.Lazily written and indifferently directed, but a fitfully engaging showcase for a handful of razor-sharp comic talents.I didn't think Diaz could be humiliated more than she was in \"Knight and Day,\" drugged and shipped as luggage, but I was wrong.Cameron Diaz's fem spin on Billy Bob Thornton's Bad Santa should have added up to raunchy fun.

More like Turkey of Mars.Falls into a classic Carpenter quagmire, unable to follow through on many of its intriguing ideas.In space, no one can hear you groan, since sound does not carry in a vacuum. Theaters showing Ghosts of Mars will not have this advantage, so the film's inanities will be audible and visible.It's more than a little sad to realize this is what Carpenter's career has come to.Henstridge ... has neither the heft nor the acting chops to carry the film.Dulls the viewer with a parade of second-hand thrills.It starts as enjoyable B-movie pulp, degenerates to camp, then turns into laughable lunacy, as a Martian-style Marilyn Manson exhorts zombie troops through endless scenes of slaughter.Stands on its own by sheer directorial verve and a fascinating flashback structure.The dialogue is stilted, the acting is mediocre and the special effects are too.It's distressingly amateurish and hackneyed to the point of absurdity.Hey, if you're a fan of mutilation, dismemberment and decapitation, have I got a movie for you!Sloppy and derivative.The Mars movies keep coming, and they aren't getting any better.Becomes one big yawn of uninspired battle sequences, half-baked plotting and ultra-clunky dialogue leading to a lame, tacked-on coda.A dull, depressing exercise in amateurism from a filmmaker in serious decline.What's almost charming about Carpenter's new film is that he doesn't seem concerned about providing auds with their weekly fix of new screen effects but instead prefers his space adventure on the funky side, even if that means the funk gets ridiculous.If you're looking for a mindless sci-fi/action/horror flick, this is one you may want to check out.A hapless mishmash of poorly constructed dialogue and ill-conceived action sequences.In a summer of really rotten movies it still stands out for its wretchedness...has the air of something falling several rungs below straight-to-video standards.Though Ghosts of Mars is watchable and even exciting, it's not one of [Carpenter's] best.I cannot fathom why Carpenter would want to brand his name to this movie, akin to leaving fingerprints at the scene of a crime.This movie is cheesy, it's fun, it's loud and it's not trying to be 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY...it's low-grade entertainment and it works!Those going in hopes of the over-the-top fun of Carpenter's last picture, Vampires, will leave sorely disappointed.A muddled mix of wayward rock video, sci-fi schlock and blood-splattering horror.Listen up, you hard-core sci-fi addicts. We're going for a ride -- and I do mean ride.A combination of sloppy movie-making and poor storytelling.Another strong outing for Carpenter, a B-movie that knows its place, delivers its goods, then gets the hell out of our face.If the director continues to make films like this, the delights he once offered will be nothing but a distant memory.A chafing film filled with an abundance of plot problems.It loves being quick and dirty, and it wants you to love it too. That honesty can be hard to resist, even when the film itself starts to falter.I'm not the type to bash a \"popcorn movie\" for not being Macbeth, but even B-movie genre fare needs to be held to some kind of standard.The most disturbing thing about an aggressively tame production is the suspicion that John Carpenter has been taken over by one of his own mindless zombie Martians.There's a great deal of promise in the outline of the tale, but somewhere along the line, the execution went awry.It's hard to call this a thriller, since there is nothing thrilling about it.a '70s zombie picture with the posturing bravado and buddy-movie elements of an '80s sci-fi/action pictureThere's a difference between a simple plot and a stupid one. Carpenter's is a no-brainer, but it's executed with flair, talent, and few lapses in logic....no logra superar ese status de ser una pel\u00edcula pasajera y punto...Carpenter's work is recognizable as human art, but art untarnished by the sheen and polish of a global popular culture.One of the movie's first images is a flashing 'Auto Pilot' sign, and that's how it seems to have been made.The acting is so pallid that you're never sure the cast members quite get the jokes.One heaping plate of sci-fi cheese, a film that looks like it got lost on its way to the video shelves and ended up in theaters by mistake.Someday we're all going to look back on this one and l-a-a-a-augh.Little more than a heavy-metal music video. On Mars.As \"Ghosts of Mars\" movies go, John Carpenter's is probably the best....there is an artificiality to the whole thing that never lets you forget you are watching a movie.starts out as a fairly effective sci-fi horrorshow, then quickly devolves into a mindless action movieWritten, directed, and edited with the offhand shoddiness of a day worker thinking about his evening beer.It's like watching a John Carpenter greatest-hits reel done by a rank amateur.Once you've seen one beheading or similarly bloody killing, you've seen them all, and that's all of any vague interest that Carpenter has to offer here.You'll wish you were on Mars and not on Earth suffering through this movie.The monsters were just not scary.a complete and utter disasterOriginal movies on the Sci-Fi Channel have better production values.More Mars lacks than Mars attacks and an outing for Carpenter die-hards only.A turd wrapped up in a nice bow is still a turd.Ghosts of Mars is not Carpenter at his best. It may very well be Carpenter at rock bottom.Mad Max Heads for the Angry Red Planet on a Pitch Black Night of the Living Dead.Cheesy D grade popcorn guilty pleasure...A rather sturdy modernized mash-up of Assault on Precinct 13 and Escape from New York.The whole planet looks like a WWF Halloween special. It's The Night of the Living Martians!I guess John Carpenter the careless purveyor of slime and hokum is the only John Carpenter we've got, and that's better than none at all.Provides a full-fledged blast of undiluted B-movie zest.Sci-fi fans will also recognize this plot from \"Pitch Black\" and \"Red Planet,\" both of which are superior to this film.Schlocky, sluggish shoot-'em-up.It's big, gory, ugly fun, just the way you want it to be.There's no reason on Earth, or Mars for that matter, for anyone to waste their time, money or energy in seeing this film.A flawed but worthy effort from an auteur whose near-misses are more entertaining than many others' hits.Carpenter has brought his curatorial care to the nuances, and the movie achieves wipeout energy.A tired and dispiriting affair that takes forever to get going.",

        "document": "I think at this point somebody needs to tell Robin Williams that the whole white-guy hip-hop routine was played out around 1997.Been there done that.The best joke is that the RV in question gets 4 miles to the gallon. With mileage like that, not even Hollywood is going to be able to afford the next road-trip film.How fallen is the mighty Robin Williams, to plummet from the quality of \"One Hour Photo\" to \"RV,\" a nearly unbearable movie.What follows plays a lot like National Lampoon's Vacation, only without that film's refreshing sense of crueltyExceedingly juvenile and strained of any colorful imagination not to mention hopelessly lame, RV is a colossally clunky vehicle in every sense of the word.A workmanlike family comedy with enough pratfalls and poo jokes for tykes and enough sentimentality for parents.RV works up an ingratiating sweetness that partially compensates for its blunt predictability and meager laughs.A family film that is only sporadically funny.If Robin Williams is seeking a return to comedy glory, RV is not the vehicle that will take him there.None of the four leads are particularly interesting ... [and Robin Williams'] performance is dishearteningRV travels the comic highways similar to those driven by National Lampoon's Vacation's Griswolds, but the insufferable Munros leave us wishing they'd befall a fate more like that of the stranded family in The Hills Have Eyes.Williams simply can't do much of anything with the forced and recycled material other than occasionally say 'my bad.' Indeed.Far more silly than sublime, but it has its moments.RV is a well written comedy and welcome evidence of Williams' talent as a comic actor.Not unbearably terrible, just thoroughly mediocre.If the words \"Robin Williams family comedy\" strike terror into your heart, then you may be pleasantly surprised by RV, because for once he's not playing a blubbering man-child.Of course, it all winds up with absurdly contrived lessons about family bonding, including a climactic soliloquy by Williams that's barely short of laughable.Williams' virtuoso hijinking and Daniels' Huggy Bearish bonhomie save this from complete ignominy, but we've seen it all before.Surprisingly palatable family comedy...A genuinely terrific main cast makes it all work within the confines of its all-ages intent....never quite as bad as it probably should have been...A disappointment for both Robin Williams and Men In Black director Barry Sonnenfeld, this vacation-from-hell plotline quickly grows tediousRobin Williams hasn't been this funny in many moons.When it comes to this road-trip comedy, the question isn't 'Are we there yet?' It's: 'Is it over yet?'This is an ugly, desperate, witless little movie that, even if you happen to like it, will evaporate from your memory in the time it takes to flip the channel.i really hated itThere are some sequences where you will love the characters and others where you can't stand them. Hmm, maybe RV is close to the real thing after all.Sonnenfeld tries to do for recreational vehicle vacations what Airplane! did for air travel. And, as evidenced by the film's many big laughs, he mainly succeeds.In RV, the downwardly spiraling career trajectories of Robin Williams and director Barry Sonnenfeld intertwine like the ropes of a tangled parachute.It probably sounded like a swell idea in the pitch meeting.Robin Williams tricks us into believing he can control his inner maniac beyond the film's first 15 minutes; when he fails, any hopes of RV going off-formula are dashed.Though Sonnenfeld is credited as the director, no one seems behind the wheel of this comic wreck, which bypasses Williams' funny antics and takes the low road through a torrent -- literally -- of potty jokes.The movie will simply make a few million bucks and vanish, relegated to the darker closets of Blockbuster and Netflix, and historians will politely forget about it out of respect for the careers of those involved.The spirit of Chevy Chase rides againMunros survive dirt-encrusted pratfalls and exploding stink bombs to become the world's happiest family, we realize that this desperate movie can't even convince itself it's funny.Outsized huckster idiocy...By the end, the crudity is so excessive, it makes National Lampoon's Vacation look as sophisticated as The Accidental Tourist by comparison.R.V. isn't just a bad movie; it's more than that, it's symptomatic of a kind of bad movie that seems to be proliferating like cinematic cockroaches.Invariably, each summer vacation movie can be judged by the quality of its obligatory gag related to going to the bathroom in the wilderness or amid the complications of foreign plumbing.",

        "document": "While the extraordinarily talented Polish-born director rarely falters in translating the source's theatrical strengths, his Venus in Fur feels oddly impersonal, lacking the trademark touch of Polanski perversity.Polanski seems to revel in defeating the limitations imposed by this stagey project, which may be among the most personal of his career -- a movie that laughs at pain and sex and the absurdity of life even as it acknowledges life's terror and wonder.\"Revels in deception.\"In both style and substance, \"Venus in Fur\" feels tossed off, a finger exercise to get Polanski warmed up for another project.It's an actor's pic, and they both come through with grand performances.Desire makes buffoons of us all. Now strike dear mistress, and cure his heart.Polanski makes an intriguing battle of the sexes out of a filmed playPerhaps he is more drawn to Mr. Ives's quasi-feminist rationalization of sexual fetish than Sacher-Masoch's explanation of it as mastery over repressed feelings, and somehow sees parallels between the play and his own sexual felony.As the pair comport themselves between the play's text and their differing interpretation, Polanski ruthlessly makes unsentimental play of their fevered, increasingly furious attraction. Carnage ensues.The shifting power dynamics -- between the characters and the roles they are playing -- are enthralling.\"Venus in Fur,\" a whip-smart dissection of gender politics via some teasing S&M, is arch. So arch in fact that it is surprising it's a Roman Polanski film.Ever the alchemist, Roman Polanski continues his quest for the process whereby theatre is transmuted and reforged into film.A tale of destruction and creation bolstered by two intense and noteworthy performances.Seigner's and Amalric's ability to move seamlessly between play and film dialogue reflects not just acting ability but years of experience as working performers.The couple's movie-long pas de deux, during which time a reversal of roles takes place and the inner Thomas is exposed to the world (us), is staged with delicious irony and ingenuity by Mr. Polanskifleet, funny and ferocious[The] rare filmed theater piece that leaves you smiling, thinking, and maybe a bit hot and bothered, to boot.The film has a creepy allure but, as movies featuring full-bore sexual gamesmanship often do, it wears thin.Seigner's d\u00e9colletage is a constant detraction because her breasts upstage both actors, even though some may argue that they are the best part of the film.It's a shrewd game of cat and mouse, showcasing Polanski's ability to work his actors and to pace the drama with a minimum of frills. It doesn't get more bare-bones than this, and yet there is never a dull moment.You'd be hard pressed to imagine a more seemingly perfect match of director and material than Roman Polanski and \"Venus in Fur.\" Too bad it isn't a wickeder, subtler, more imaginative movie.If you didn't see the play onstage and don't know what you're missing, this Venus in Fur has its demonic, masochistic charms.Polanski's film is wonderfully light on its feet - it never feels hemmed in, though it also never leaves the space in which it begins - but it lands its punches.Roman Polanski's been making films about psycho-sexual mind games for decades, and when his opening shot poses his stage director next to a very phallic cactus, you know he's at it again.If you're looking for a vivacious and magnetic performance, you can't do much better than Emmanuelle Seigner for this year so far. That's likely your main and only reason to catch it.Venus in Fur never forgets to be playful and fluid, always moving, shifting gears, and surprising.Is imagination more real than actuality?Roman Polanski delivers a soup\u00e7on of entertaining insouciance.What is surprising is how little Polanski juices the material with his usual devilish touch.Polanski's direction of his performers is assured. His camerawork is precise. And the power games - moving, shifting, constantly surprising and inescapably, queasily conflating art and artist - hold us in their thrall.While [Emmanuelle Seigner has] never been this commanding, she's always had a cool intelligence, even in the delightfully disreputable 'Bitter Moon.'An exercise in moviegoing pain.One of the delights of Mr. Ives's play, and of Mr. Polanski's nimble rendering of it, is the way it jumps in and out of the play within.Venus in Fur is a rather amusing delight, but its pleasures rarely transcend those of a surface-level, kinky pas de deux between two superb performers.The director navigates an enclosed space with cinematic flair, his dynamic camerawork assuring that the talky proceedings never feel especially \"stagy.\"Thankfully, there's real depth of feeling and playful perversion shared between Seigner and Amalric, who give already unusual material a wicked spin.Polanski's direction of Venus In Fur is masterful-a pleasure in and of itself-but Seigner is the star attraction here, giving one of the best performances of her distinguished career.Roman Polanski. Sadomasochism. What could possibly go wrong?It's tricky, tasty and tense...Seigner holds her own - and then some - opposite the subtly expressive Mathieu Amalric.Polanski orchestrates this cat-and-mouse game with devilish delight, dancing around Ives's play as if it were a pagan bonfire, jabbing at it with his figurative pitchfork.It is hard to avoid the suspicion that Polanski is treading water before starting work on a \"proper film\".Expert writing, directing and acting help this offbeat drama discover some powerful new themes in a novella that has been scandalising Western society since it was first published in 1870.Polanski has given Seigner a gift of a part: she's brazen, energetic and extremely funny in an ultimately scary way.A devastatingly funny, exhausting picture that could potentially confound, but just about frantic and witty enough to hopefully prompt one universal reaction: \"Christ, that was bloody enjoyable.\"This is Polanski's second theatre adaptation in a row after Carnage, and at the age of 80 he shows no signs of slowing down. It's easily his most enjoyable film for some time.Like Emil Jannings in thrall to Marlene Dietrich in The Blue Angel, Amalric's director is a figure of comedy and pity -- and seems to relish his own sexual humiliation at the hands of this unlikely Venus.[VIDEO ESSAY] Here is an energizing spoonful of soup-to-nuts fetishism, with teasing desert courses strewn throughout.Polanski revisits his kinky past with this stage adaptation that cuts close to the bone.Brave and clever, it's an enjoyable piece of arthouse expertise.This pungent comedy set in combat's erogenous zone is Polanski at the top of his game.A playful Polanski serves up a rich and provocative discourse on sexual politics and gender bias with this pithy and extremely witty two-hander bolstered by the exceptional leads.A fascinating study of power games, sexual manipulation and textual interpretation, driven by dazzling performances from Emmanuelle Seigner and Mathieu Amalric.Heavily reliant on the skills of his two actors to keep us engaged. Fortunately, the two actors are both on top form.While Polanski the filmmaker might flirt with submissiveness, you can always sense him lurking behind the camera, safe-word at the ready. Cut!Roman Polanski playfully deconstructs sexual power relationships in this ribald, talky two-hander.Too rarified to break out the arthouse circuit and missing the star wattage of Carnage or The Ghost, this is nonetheless essential viewing for Polanski fans.If the film never quite escapes its theatrical provenance and setting, it's still a bracingly bumpy ride.A little overwhelmed by its own self-indulgence and contrivance, which ultimately seeks in damaging your enjoyment of the overall piece.Polanski's unavoidably stagy adaptation of David Ives' celebrated Broadway play is an enjoyably witty two-hander, confined to its theatre setting, yet with much to say about gender roles in the world beyond.It's theatrical but increasingly fascinating as an arrogant director (Mathieu Amalric) auditions an actress (Emmanuelle Seigner) for a stage version of the titular novel about sexual submission.Mathieu Amalric is perfect as the director's alter ego as a director, but Emmanuelle Seigner's Vanda is truly superb.Has Roman Polanski lost his movie mojo?A mature film but not an elderly oneIt's witty, perceptive, penetrating, beautifully made, ties in with other Polanski works and feels like one of the filmmaker's most personal films.Roman Polanski proves his dexterity once again with this dark, mystifying, and anything but simple two-character, single-location film.A grand seduction staged in an intimate space.\"Venus in Fur\" is about the mysterious games men and women play, and Seigner and Amalric are up to it.Fun, sexy, playful, and edgy, it also features two wonderful performances from Emmanuelle Seigner and Mathieu Amalric.What plays out is roller-coaster ride of shifting identity and sexual brinkmanship...Mischievous and sadistic by turns, it becomes a deadly serious battle of the sexes.Every good movie offers its own pleasures. Roman Polanski's adaptation of David Ives' play offers us a unique set of them: the moments an actor transitions ... The script ... is good, but what you're really watching is the acting.Polanski's film feels curiously uninspired in discussing much more than the very base text.A film that joyously revels in blurred lines, Venus in Furs sees Polanski return to his bold and fiercely original best.Polanski's Venus in Fur is neither profound nor erotic (at least not for this viewer) but it is wonderfully witty and a generous gift from the director to his two stars.By expertly embellishing the theatrical, Polanski has made Venus in Fur thrillingly cinematic.Polanski knows the jig is up: this is a beautifully framed mounting of a play, filmed elegantly with simply composed shots.Roman Polanski is in playfully perverse form with this nimble pas de deux adapted from David Ives' stage hit.\"Venus in Fur\" finds Roman Polanski transferring a New York stage hit to the screen with maximum fidelity and facility, and a minimum of fuss.After years of respectable filmmaking, it's refreshing to witness a reinvigorated Roman Polanski willing to once again delve deep into seedy psychodrama.Hugely entertaining.Sexual desire, jet-black comedy, kinky mischievousness, an air of tense claustrophobia: It's all there in Venus in Fur, and even if the movie isn't particularly deep, it's a constant playful delight.Venus in Fur isn't quite as demented as Polanski's earlier comedies, but it's an invigorating walk through the maze of fantasy-in a realm where 50 Shades of Gray is wreaking havoc, it has relevance, and brains.S&M dance or feminist tract? Late career breather ... or Polanski answering his harshest critics? A cagey two-hander with tour-de-force turn by the sexy Seigner.A playful-yet-serious rumination on sexual gamesmanship presented through a form of theatrical artifice that Polanski embraces while giving it cinematic polish.Music by six-time Oscar nominee Alexandre Desplat should inspire the senses, too, if somehow the moves of Seigner (the real-life Mrs. Polanski) don't do enough for you.\"Venus in Fur,\" the disturbing and provocative Roman Polanski film of David Ives' Broadway play, portrays a power struggle between the object of obsession and the eye of the beholder.\"Venus in Fur\" is a stellar achievement.Like \"Carnage,\" \"The Pianist,\" \"Rosemary's Baby\" and more, Roman Polanski's latest is a creepy exploration of claustrophobia and perversity that should not be missed.Venus In Fur is essentially a weightless skit, a parody of those hoary old archetypes of Man and Woman. But it's also a tribute to Seigner, who seizes the gift of a role that allows her to be sexy, funny and imposing.The two-hander plays like a crackling fireA funny, sensual experience that speaks uncomfortable truths about what constitutes and dictates male-female relationships.Wickedly smart and wickedly playful, Roman Polanski's adaptation of David Ives' Tony-nominated Venus in Fur works on so many levels, it's almost dizzying.It's the concept that's a bit chewed-over.Never underestimate Roman Polanski.Rarely do you see a film with just two characters, but Amalric and Seigner have so much control over themselves that they keep you entranced throughout the entire 96 minutes.There are books about gender, power and identity politics, but as captivating as this story.The haunted-house lighting is a perfect match for the claustrophobic intimacy of this two-hander - and camouflage, perhaps, for the fact that \"Venus in Fur\" remains more play than film.One thing that makes the dialogue-heavy movie so compelling (and also something that Polanski does so well) is an undercurrent of dread.Whether you like it or not, Roman Polanski is a great artist, and even the minor films of his fugitive decades glimmer with the claustrophobia and sardonic bleakness of his greatest work.Pay attention to the camera, and you will see that Polanski is a clinician. He is in the thrall of no one.Maybe you see where all this is going. But even if you do, getting there is still good, queasy fun.A tasty light hors d'oeuvre rather than a full meal....beneath a brittle veneer of verbal dash and cleverness this stagebound adaptation has little insight to give us into anything except the sexual hubris of an aging man, and frankly, we're not sure we give a damn.As always with Polanski, the narrative's eccentricities are cloaked in an expert veneer of classicism.",

        "document": "No End in Sight offers an emphatic, well-supported answer to a question that has already begun to be mooted on television talk shows: Who lost Iraq?.A damning appraisal of America's handling of the Iraq war.The larger picture presented here will likely be old news, although it will jab the memory and still will shock.Want to kick start a drinking problem? Just give No End in Sight a look, and you're assured a cold, dark night ingesting anything nearby that will sooth the post-viewing depression.The anger that fuels Ferguson's film is felt in nearly every frame.The most compelling and least partisan of all the Iraq documentaries.Rehashes information you already knew and tries to inflate trivia into scandal.A valuable summary of a variety of missteps that have led to the current debacle.Doesn't offer startlingly new information, [but] its calm, methodical presentation of the evidence is a solid contribution to...the American public's understanding.Its message should be dispassionately studied by anyone who presumes to care about the future of this country.For anyone who's wondering why we're still stuck in Iraq, give this quick 100-minuter a whirl and get filled in.Bleak, dry and marginally repetitive, \"Sight\" fails to answer with clarity why bad decisions were made.The most important film of the year thus far and, more significantly, the most comprehensive, clear-eyed account of the Iraq debacle and the arrogance behind it that we have.You really should see this movie, even though it will make you sick.A tidy summary of the tragic mistakes made, and the brutal arrogance displayed, by the Bush administration in its prosecution of the Iraq war.It's a film that only begins to take baby steps in telling what went wrong and how insane it is to stick with such a bad war policy....a movie that will make you angry or sad. It provides no escape or transport from, but rather deeper engagement with, the regrettably real world.Ferguson consults not the administration's political opponents, but the very experts that the U.S. government selected and sent into the Baghdad fray ...This is a movie about the very officials who boasted 'I don't do quagmires' (then-defense secretary Rumsfeld), but who hadn't actually done the planning or simple reading of other people's plans that might have avoided that very fate.The movie's larger points are sobering and relevant, no matter how many times they've already been made.Watching the film, which is well-organized but utterly artless, one wonders who, exactly, it's trying to sway.Charles Ferguson's film may be the best, and the final word on the subject.a horror show guaranteed to make you madWell-constructed and well-researched documentary which methodically lays out the groundwork for what went wrong in Iraq.No End is Sight is the product of a calmly systematic desire for knowledge, and as such, does not offer solutions, only profound insight.By the time No End in Sight gets to a late chapter titled \"Things Fall Apart,\" you'll believe that call could have been made a long time ago.A thorough, level-headed examination of the Bush administration's failure to properly prepare for, and execute, the war.It doesn't matter if you're a news junkie or clueless about current events, you need to see this movie.There's no shortage of opinion, but what Ferguson is aiming for in this fascinating 102-minute dissection is a professional critique of foreign policy.A persuasive argument that the inception of, and response to, the Iraq War perverted America's ideals and intellect. Its moderate temperament hides obvious roars: Remembering outrage is all that will keep this from again occurring unopposed.[Director] Ferguson delivers the calm, meticulous survey of U.S. policy that legions of critics of Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 have been waiting for.Yet another doc that socks it to the current administration's foreign policy--this one most effectively.Should be required viewing for anyone who thinks the Iraq war is progressing according to plan.If you want take the leap from disbelief and confusion to a clearer, empowering understanding of how we arrived at our current predicament, then political scientist Charles Ferguson's documentary No End In Sight is highly recommended.Soberly narrated by Campbell Scott, the film is a meticulous, thoroughly engrossing lesson in how not to win friends (or wars) and influence people (or potential terrorists).A systematic and rigorous history of the Iraq war to date.The film is methodically edited, interspersing tales from the ground with policy wonks, decisions with consequences, until it paints the administration into a corner.A damning critique conducted with surgical precision, Ferguson's Sundance Festival prize-winning film is arguably one of the most comprehensive and rigorous docus about the failures of the Bush administration vis-a-vis the Iraq War.A documentary that rues the fact that the US was not able to impose its will on the Iraqi people, but never questions the right to do so.A blistering, on-point expose of the movers and shakers who paved our way into a senseless conflict.This is the Iraq War documentary that covers all bases...Just listen to the silence of those who refuted Fahrenheit 911....Ferguson's take has the precision and seriousness of purpose of a sniper's bullet while Moore's is a homemade shrapnel grenade....the saddest, scariest horror movie I've seen in years.Ferguson's case is so confidently built that it seems unassailable...You know the Iraq war is going badly. What you may not know is how it also started badly.We all need to learn a few lessons from this and ratchet up our outrage.As one of the interviewees put it succinctly, there is no light at the end of the tunnel.Even dedicated news junkies will gain new understanding of a campaign with no end in sight.The best documentary to be made about the war in Iraq.The film is not anti-war but anti-arrogance and anti-idiocy.This one is not just a series of personal, one-sided attacks, as Moore's film seemed to be. Instead, filmmaker Charles Ferguson uses interviews with former Bush administration officials, journalists, former soldiers and others to make his case.Absorbing documentary that dissects the mind-numbing incompetence that has defined this White House.You'll leave the picture shaken and stirred, knowing that if the right people were in charge, this whole Iraq thing could have worked. To call this film a \"must-see\" is an understatement.Charles Ferguson holds this fact to be self-evident: that the chaos in Iraq is the direct result of a handful of bad policy decisions made very early in the war.The most riveting film of the summer, and also the saddest.Narrated with a detached, grim authority by Campbell Scott, Ferguson's film is surely the most nonhistrionic cinematic explanation of our current geopolitical woes yet seen.A clear-eyed appraisal and condemnation of Bush administration war policies as seen through the eyes of people in a position to note the disastrous choices that left a country in chaos.No End in Sight makes one thing clear: Were it not so bloody, the war in Iraq would be destined to become a case study in the nation's business schools.This is depressing stuff, brilliantly presented.We need to hear the story again and again, for no amount of rage and disbelief can turn what the Bush Administration did into someone else's problem.Organized, concise and plain as day, \"No End In Sight\" is necessary viewing for audiences the world over.Leaves you furious at an administration of armchair warriors, yet it offers the catharsis of cold, hard truth.[W]e need ... a multi-volume/reel history [of] the unprecedented stupidity and mendacity of the Bush administration, and Charles Ferguson's infuriating documentary could be volume one.will have you alternately slapping your forehead in stunned disbelief and shaking your head in disgust.Essential viewing for any patriot.Lucid, concise and devastating.[No End in Sight] may be the best and saddest film of the year so far.No End in Sight, the latest Iraq documentary, is the first to attempt a detailed historical overview and probably the only one with the potential to reach across partisan lines, a true rarity in the sphere of political filmmaking.Although this is Ferguson's first feature -- he paid for it himself -- it's a masterfully assured piece of filmmaking.First-time writer-producer director Charles Ferguson is a noted think-tank scholar who is less interested in casting partisan blame than figuring out just exactly how such a colossal debacle came about.Remember the scene in A Clockwork Orange where Alex has his eyes clamped open and is forced to watch a movie? I imagine a similar experience for the architects of our catastrophe in Iraq. I would like them to see No End in Sight.If any movie can rid Americans of 'Iraq war fatigue,' it's Charles Ferguson's muscular documentary No End in Sight. It provokes potent new feelings of outrage and catalyzes fresh thoughts about the right way to run a government, especially ours.A raft of documentaries have come along since the start of the war, some of them accusatory, some investigative, some empathetic, nearly all of them skeptical. None is better argued or more searing than No End in Sight.Ferguson is admirably tenacious in assigning blame for the boneheaded mistakes that have doomed Iraqi reconstruction.No End in Sight will leave you floored, agape and enraged anew.The point of [Ferguson's] film seems to be that even though the invasion was unnecessary and wrong, it still could have turned out much better than it has, and he tries to pinpoint key errors during the first weeks and months after March 2003.No End in Sight is the most coolheaded of the Iraq war documentaries, the most methodical and the least polemical. Yet it's the one that will leave audiences the most shattered, angry and astounded.Its list of interviewees includes a number of insiders once deeply involved in the bungled aftermath of America's invasion of Iraq. It also includes some shocking, on-the-ground footage from the war that has not been seen elsewhere.It comes across as something of a horror story: This happened, it was a fiasco -- and now there might not be any way of fixing it.Masterfully edited and cumulatively walloping.Charles Ferguson has designed No End in Sight to sink in....words speak even louder than visual evidence in Charles Ferguson's lacerating analysis of America's occupation of Iraq....his [Ferguson's] brilliant and riveting documentary about the Bush administration's failures in Iraq, is at once the most devastating cinematic postmortem on America's colossal blunder in the Middle East, and the most sober.So No End In Sight is hardly another partisan anti-war doc. Instead, it's a cogent, often infuriating explication of how the execution of the war went awry.It's a furious, if quietly stated, indictment of the president and all his men in the debacle that our adventure in Iraq has become.Ferguson's inquiry into the war doesn't spend much time on the ground, but it features a tense round-up of talking heads and finds an effective weapon in their shared tone of frustration.This essential documentary is a clear-eyed, coherent dissection of how crucial decisions were made in the first weeks and months following the American invasion of Iraq.While this incriminating documentary makes a convincing case against the White House, it arrives a bit belatedly, at a juncture when John McCain is just about the only loyalist left still sipping the Bush Kool Aid.Ferguson's debut doc is a brilliant piece of investigative journalism.",
        "summary": "Charles Ferguson's documentary provides a good summary of the decisions that led to the mess in post-war Iraq, and offers politically interested audiences something they'd been looking for: a lowdown on the decision making.",

        "document": "Cornish's film stands on its own and also fits comfortably into a proud cinematic tradition; it owes nothing to any antecedent, and yet feels like the latest in a lineage of crowd-pleasers.A fresh and funny twist on the alien-invasion epic.Attack the Block strains somewhat to deliver a climactic moral, but the way it slyly shifts our sympathies to Moses and his crew (at the expense of another species, granted) without overplaying their deprivation puts more serious-minded indies to shame.Evokes far more childlike Spielbergian wonder than this summer's similar Super 8.An elegant, deliciously wrinkly action film loaded with humor, racial tension and gloopy violence.A low-budget adventure with propulsive energy and plenty of laughs.There could be a few more scares and laughs, but it's a blast to be drawn into this urban ecosystem that is, to us Yanks, itself a bit alien.It enhances a sense of the world rather than peddling distraction from it.An entertaining thriller in the tradition of 1970s B-action films, with an unknown cast, energetic special effects and great energy.Snappy and confident, funny and exciting - an alien space-horror comedy that will engage even those who think they're beyond this sort of thing.Minor characters strive to be known as Props and Mayhem, and Attack the Block deserves the former for the wicked way it creates the latter.If Attack the Block doesn't cut quite as deeply as Cornish, in the movie's first third, hints that it might, at least it's powered more by modest smarts than by excessive, wasteful amounts of dough.Attack the Block is quite a brilliant debut by Joe Cornish, the type of fun genre flick that we just don't see that often anymore.The monsters of the popular imagination are called upon to save us from imaginary monsters.An infectiously larky extraterrestrial invasion movie that respects the genre conventions while spicing the brew with distinctive local flavor.Inevitable comparisons with J.J. Abrams's similarly themed \"Super 8\" favors writer/director Joe Cornish's seemingly effortless ability to extract laughs and shocks from an alien invasion.The argot, drugs and council-estate setting may put some audiences off, but they would be missing a socially conscious, energetic horror comedy that's scary and very funny.Attack the Block distinguishes itself from its genre compatriots by prizing theme and place over referentiality and hip, out of the box \"grindhouse\"-ness.Attack The Block has an agreeably scrappy early John Carpenter Dark Star/Assault On Precinct 13 vibe, rich in moral ambiguity and gleeful, smartass genre-mashing.Attack the Block is exactly the kind of distinctly homegrown product that the British film industry should be making.While I enjoyed the film, I did leave the theater feeling it's been slightly overrated.With tremendous assurance and utter lack of condescension, Cornish puts his young cast playing the council-block kids at the very centre of the action. He directs them tremendously well and they reward him with performances of charm and energy...Attack the Block is essentially an action thriller and as such is effective.This pitch perfect blend of sci-fi action, comedy and social commentary winds up a gleeful delight.Writer/director Joe Cornish has young wannabe gangstas battling aliens in a hilarious, action-packed combination of monster movie and underclass teenage story. Trust!When the going gets tough. Attack the Block hangs as tough as any modern thriller should.Fighting aliens with these diverse, street-smart, slang-slinging little criminals is all the more fun for fighting them in the Block: a fantastic funhouse of a battlefield, providing plenty of room for extremely witty and well-shot action sequences.One of the year's smartest and most giddily enjoyable films.There's a lot more going on than meets the eye in this slick, exciting, UK monster movie.A solidly executed example of the genres and conventions it intelligently satirizes.Fish Tank meets Skyline in this hilarious and arresting British sci-fi comedy.The story unfolds visually for the most part, and the body language is enough to keep us informed. It just doesn't quite meet expectations for a movie that has an interesting premiseCornish and his effects team work magic with the creature designs. I won't spoil their look here as their eventual reveal provides quite a payoff, but it's an ingenious, scary, and memorable movie monster they've created.This wonderfully talented filmmaker will get to the serious stuff later in what is sure to be his long career. Right now, he seems far more interested in crafting a good-time scare, which he achieves superbly.It successfully combines action with wit, social commentary and comedy.Attack the Block is a fast-paced and inventive action/science-fiction film with an unconventional set of heroes.Deserves the praise it's received.There isn't a single thing I would change about the film's brisk 88-minute running time.This year's best tribute to E.T.Cornish raises the stakes and the emotional investment of the characters, making Attack the Block more effective in all of the different genres its trying to pull off at the same time.The best science fiction movie of 2012.Pits street kids against aliens in a fast-paced battleLike a Brit Joe Dante, debuting writer-director Joe Cornish both respects and rattles the genre, and he transforms his low budget into a virtue.Employs a terse set-up and sparse characterisations to rein in any sentimentality and stress the ambiguities of its rich political and allegorical depths.It fizzes and sparks, but sputters too much to really catch light.I've seen this year's District 9 and it is called Attack The Block.One of the year's most dynamic, stunning and timeless blockbusters.Some may complain about Cornish's readiness to assault your eyes and eardrums with zero warning, but a few loud bolts from the shadows still shouldn't result in anyone walking away unimpressed.Cornish deconstructs our preconceived notions about the people we live with and around, and then he blows them all up, figuratively and literally.Brit comedian-TV presenter Joe Cornish emerges fully formed as an exciting new writer-helmer with his enormously appealing debut feature.While it lacks originality, Attack the Block zooms along with energy and deadpan humor.Here is a shaggy monster movie that pulls double-duty as a satire of class and ethnic barriers, and how those barriers quickly disappear when we are forced to fight for our simple survival.Attack the Block wants us to believe that its heroes aren't all that bad . . . once you've given them your wallet.Cornish makes a feature debut here that's almost as stunning as when his pal (and executive producer) Edgar Wright invaded the cineplex with \"Shaun of the Dead.\"So if you only go see one movie this weekend, please make it Attack the Block. See it twice in fact. Let's encourage good filmmaking.A throwback monster movie made by people who clearly adore the films they're referencing.Employs its sci-fi tale to wrestle with issues of race and class structure -- the sort of deep thought lost on Hollywood kingpins like Michael Bay, whose idea of sensitive racial exploration was to create Amos 'n' Andy robots for that Transformers flick.(I)t's the ready reinvention of the whole alien invasion conceit that becomes Attack the Block's greatest artistic contribution.The coolest part of \"Attack the Block\" is how it does a switcheroo with the thugs, initially encouraging us to think they're rotters and then showing us there's more to them than meets the eye.Few movies this year have been as all-out fun to watch as this one.A very strong British monster movie and a great idea, and ode to South London, to base it all in a council block.It's a blistering debut.Blending laughs, thrills and sci-fi chills with aplomb, Cornish's debut is nothing less than - yes! - the new Shaun Of The Dead. Believe, bruv.Utter blocks.This energetic mix of Kidulthood and Critters is insanely entertaining; we can't wait to see what Cornish will direct next.However much goodwill you chuck at it, this isn't quite the instant cult classic you want it to be. But now and then it's as blinding as those alien gnashers.This is, in terms of its central plot, a pretty straightforward monster movie, but it has a very distinctive character.A fun slice of nostalgic geek cinema that effortlessly blends action, comedy, horror and sci-fi to create an instant genre classic.It is one of the purest film pleasures I've encountered in a while, and the only real problem I have with it is that I want a new Joe Cornish movie tomorrow.Snarling alien monsters are up against a teenage gang of South London hoodies in Joe Cornish's pacy, amusing and at times frightening action-adventure romp.\"Attack the Block\" demands to be seen simply because it is a thrill - a pulse-raiser whose perfect construction and pointed wit make it one of the year's most exciting films.The movie's amateurishly made. But the script is full of little surprises.One of the greater imports to hit America since \"Shaun of the Dead.\"Attack the Block has a cast of nobodies, the cheesiest special effects this side of Velveeta, and it's the best sci-fi movie you'll see this summer.The inky, somewhat shapeless beings aren't any scarier than your typical Muppet. Which is kind of a problem when you're offering an R-rated thriller.Attack the Block attacks the alien invasion genre with wit, energy and a cheeky insolence that makes it out of this world.An energetic genre ride with social ambitions about race and class.This is the UK version of Super 8.This is a snarky, humorous movie about blasting aliens to bits, but if you're looking for more, you won't be left hanging.The 'hood, the Bad and the UglyThere are stylistic flourishes reminiscent of both Steven Spielberg and John Landis but this is firmly Cornish's show, a smoothly crafted sci-fi comedy horror that cleverly walks the line between laughs and scares.First-time feature filmmaker Cornish invests plenty of energy and humour into this alien invasion thrillerPoses a tongue in cheek question - \"What's scarier, hostile extra-terrestrials or black youth?\" - and then riffs on the sad reality that many people would say the latter.Attack the Block lingers with you. Cornish is a formidable filmmaker and Boyega is an outstanding talent.There are some parts of London that maybe aliens shouldn't be too eager to invade.Attack The Block balances scares with laughs incredibly well and features solid performances from everyone in the cast. Gruesome aliens and a great setting that features outstanding action scenes all make for a very fun ride.A creatively unconventional invasion movie let down by its utterly unlikeable heroes.Skilled, heartfelt entertainment done well.An adrenaline thrill ride cult action film that gets over as an unlikely sci-fi film.While all signs point to 'culty' for this film, it actually has all the mainstream appeal of a brilliant comedy and a terrifying supernatural horror.With knowing nods to such genre classics as Critters and Gremlins, The Warriors and Assault on Precinct 13, Cornish has created his own gang-banging, creature-feature gem.Does require a huge suspension of disbelief at times - alien presence aside - and a massive dollop of absolution...A blast of imagination and wit and sheer nerve, an alien invasion movie twice as entertaining as the ones Hollywood has churned out all summer, made at a fraction of the cost.The power of Attack the Block comes from smacking down cinematic clich\u00e9s, not just the ones we're familiar with but the ones its protagonists know well, too.Even though Cornish is a noted comedian in England, the focus here falls squarely on the action. Sure, there are a few laughs, but they're born of the characters and their situation, as their 'hood is transformed into an extraterrestrial war zone.An impressively energetic directorial debut, bolstered further by [Cornish's] own remarkably efficient screenplay.It's exciting, and there is plenty of gore for fans of that sort of thing, but one wishes the mix of horror and comedy leaned a little more to the horror side of the equation.Has energy and some laughs, but in the end suffers from a familiar threadbare quality.Points for thinking outside the slimy-gooey-monster box....an entertaining monster versus man actioner but it is not new or fresh. And, the monsters are nondescript, making them a simply an obstacle for the street fighters, not a threat to the world.It's a doozy, offering tight and imaginative camerawork, electric thrills, and a sharp, twisty script that plays like a social satire.The British film's quick humor, stunning visuals and a story that's entertaining, dense and timely make it the year's best extraterrestrial invasion.Attack the Block isn't a great movie, but it's fueled by a sense of energy that still makes it somewhat irresistible regardless of its (sometimes far too obvious) flaws.Balancing big laughs and big shocks, Attack the Block is a brilliant first film by anybody's standards.Attack the Block is enthusiastically yoof.Cornish plays loose and fast with conventions of the genre and he doesn't think twice about sacrificing some of his young protagonists to the creatures to underline the clear and present danger.This isn't just a bad film, it's a film that's plain wrong. Shame on everyone involved.Attack The Block is a mini marvel, and the most promising sci-fi debut since Moon.I kept hoping Michael Caine's Harry Brown would appear ready to teach them a lesson or two the hard way.A familiar situation is cleverly exploited, the characters gradually become individuals, and the admirable moral is that actions have consequences.Boldly innovative while still flashily acknowledging those that have come before - this is a movie that should (and deserves to) foster a cult audience.This has the smarts of the best sci-fi and the action to go with it: It's Aliens meets Assault On Precinct 13.The picture is a little unpolished - characters get lost, tension slackens off - but Cornish pulls off his preposterous premise with flair.Reprises scores of films, but despite an unusual combination of story with setting and characters, adds nothing in the re-doing and sports hokey creature effects.Irreverently funny without ever being spoofy...The one-liners are hilarious, and Cornish has a deft touch at weaving social commentary on urban gentrification into the narrative.Apparently, British comedian/writer Joe Cornish was paying considerable attention while he played bit parts and hung around the sets of his friends' films Shaun Of The Dead and Hot Fuzz.Perhaps one of the highest compliments I can pay Attack the Block is that it feels like a movie that might have played on a double bill with Gremlins back in the early '80s.Science-fiction buffs seeking a change of pace and fans of British pop culture shouldn't miss it.The line for this future cult hit starts here. Get in it before your friends tell you to.On its surface, \"Attack the Block\" is about unlikely heroes saving the world from an alien invasion. But those aliens...are a metaphor for all the obstacles Moses and his mates face every day...It's wall-to-wall sci-fi pop-culture bric-a-brac, yet it feels organic. There's something more at stake than the fate of a movie-ish Earth.Unfortunately, \"Attack the Block\" makes two crucial mistakes: It doesn't have great monsters. And it doesn't have great heroes.This spunky, low-budget British action-comedy proves once again that a smart script can breath new life into even the most tired of subjects.Joe Cornish directed his own script, which suffers from thin characterization, weak dialogue, and a confused ending.This movie wants and needs to come at you like a beast in the dark. Allow it.Entertaining tale of London housing-project youth battling vicious aliens should emerge as a cult hit.That the film treats marginalized youths with real respect while delivering such a raucous and inventive spin on horror comedy is the most welcome kind of cinematic miracle.A perfect genre gem, a movie that works a crowd the way a great song works a crowd. Paced beautifully, written smartly and shot with style and energy.A playful approach to the genre can be far more satisfying than Hollywood's tendency to play it safe.A clever blend of sci-fi and comedy, which pits toothy furball space invaders against young South London thugs.Pulsing with a rowdy energy, the film works as both a sci-fi horror flick and a teen adventure film.Overall, the movie's low-rent British specificity is a plus because the unique milieu provides a unique set of problems for the earthlings to overcome.In the vein of \"Shaun of the Dead\" but a lot less fun...Delight.These are the kinds of indie movies we want to see, where it's the ideas that stand out.Attack the Block may emerge as one of the summer's sleepers.Writer-director Joe Cornish's charmingly zippy debut wants to be taken seriously while evoking a childlike sense of marvel, or at least early-blockbuster nostalgia. (Is this the inner-city companion to Super 8?)Cornish has made a very accomplished debut; an exuberant genre mash-up, part sci-fi, part action movie, part comedy, executed with tremendous energy and flair.There are enough laughs to qualify as black comedy, but it's also scary enough to be thrilling.A slick horror comedy, Block contains a few fatal flaws that weaken its sense of cheery violent fun. It's difficult to root for a bunch of alien-busting kids when they all deserve prolonged spankings....the filmmaker keeps things moving to such an extent that the incoherence of the dialogue eventually becomes a non-issue...A mainstream film that refuses to pander to audiences, but instead works hard to win them over. As the kids probably no longer say: respect.Cornish draws superb performances out of his inexperienced central quintet, especially John Boyega (taciturn Moses) and Alex Esmail (livewire Pest).Exciting, entertaining, and rewarding.A genuinely great film.It's a mash up of Gremlins, E.T., a stoner comedy and a monster B-movie, delivered with a visual nod to 1970s teen gang films and reflecting the comedy smarts of, well, Joe Cornish.It plays like the rabid love child of John Carpenter's Assault On Precinct 13 and Stephen Herek's Critters... and I mean that as the highest compliment.A hilarious, slam-bang series of chases and battles that cross \"Gremlins\" with \"Assault on Precinct 13\"...The cast is splendid, the script quick-witted and the action satisfying.a bit like Goonies and War of the Worlds filtered through the original English version of SkinsToo goofy to be frightening and too lame to be funny or amusing, the picture ultimately turns into an interminable waste of time.It's surprising this thing ever got released.This fabulously inventive debut feature, written and directed by the British comedian Joe Cornish, never flags.There is much to commend in this genre-bending first feature.Joe Cornish's entertaining feature debut is an intriguing idea and has some nice moments but it also suffers from a problematic approach to its characters and is neither as funny or as scary as it should have been.Attack the Block's attempts to straddle horror and comedy are doomed: it's neither scary nor funny enough.There's some OK dialogue when the kids aren't talking gangster and a well-shot, pretty exciting climax.",
        "summary": "Effortlessly mixing scares, laughs, and social commentary, Attack the Block is a thrilling, brisky-paced sci-fi yarn with a distinctly British flavor.",

        "document": "It's never boring, and it'll sweep you up in its momentum if you give it a chance.Whether protecting his brood or his nation, Gibson is the quintessential American stoic.A riveting, slick, graphically violent piece of entertainment.The Patriot delivers what it promises.A spectacle that could cause its audience to rise up against the dull treatment of this marvelous episode from history teachers.A rip-snorting good flick that breaks the cinematic jinx against Revolutionary War stories.The fight scenes are careful, powerful, stunning, and quite realistic.The Patriot delivers, for the most part, effective, populist entertainment.Having fought the British centuries before in Braveheart, Gibson brings the same intensity to The Patriot.It wisely focuses upon common folk rather than prominent figures.The Patriot is best when it focuses on Gibson. Unfortunately, half the time it focuses on Ledger.It's the plot that's hackneyed.Often melodramatic and manipulative but it is solid, involving filmmaking so one willingly takes the ride it offers.Bloody, overlong and straining for significance ...A big-budget epic of the American Revolution, with Mel Gibson, of all people, leading the charge.While his hero is conscience-stricken about killing, Emmerich sure enjoys serving it up in generous helpings.Many graphic battle scenes, not for all teens.has its momentsIf I'd known there was going to be this much gagging sentimentality, I'd have brought a vomit bag.The main irony, of course, lies in the film's title, which suggests that the absurdly flag-waving activist should be taken at face value despite the ample evidence that defending his country is the last thing on his mind.It's the best film ever made about the Revolutionary War.No better than anyone should have expected, which is to say that it isn't any good at all.The Patriot becomes just another, albeit better, Emmerich picture:Those who like to think for themselves will find The Patriot dishonest and manipulative.Emmerich choreographs the action with breathtaking precision.The rough-and-tumble of American life during the Revolution and one brave man's struggle against his own violence.The Patriot comes across strong with some excellent supporting performances, oftentimes breathtaking cinematography and a plot that, like it or not, does tap many emotions.The Patriot pays handsome tribute to the sacrifices of men who deserve to be remembered.Every moment leads naturally to the next, and the overall effect is thrilling.It boldly asks what you'd be willing to sacrifice to gain that freedom. And what more could you ask from a Fourth of July movie?This is worth the price of admission, and even at almost three hours, your butt will not hurt.For Gibson, who is in virtually every scene, it is an acting tour de force.Effectively blends brutality and gentility, but can't find the right mix between Hollywood clich\u00e9s and the Revolution's complex history.See this movie, then go home, raise the flag, set off some fireworks, and char some meat.A typical Hollywood product that aims to get the adrenaline rushing and tug at the heartstrings, but doesn't much care about how shamelessly it goes about doing so.It repeats the formula of exclusionary representation, conceiving American history as the domain of whites, where blacks, free and slave are left on the sidelines, local color for more 'heroic' characters.The rules of summer movie-making wreck The Patriot.Reflects our wish to redeem ourselves through sacrifice. But that entails more than briefly nodding to our flaws, magnifying what we like best about our past, and waving it around, hoping the euphoria will resolve any contradictions.Like the war itself, it's too long and too bloody; unlike the war, it doesn't pay off in the end.What makes The Patriot exhausting, despite its handful of blood-boiling sequences, is the way it numbingly resembles other movies....beautiful to watch, exciting to experience, and totally without consequence once it's over.A tough, high-minded work of seriousness--those who turn their noses up at Emmerich's name will be surprised at the amount of integrity he allows The Patriot to hold.There's not much to get excited about.A gruesome hybrid, a mix of sentimentality and brutality that suggests a Lethal Weapon movie directed by Norman Rockwell.A movie of cornball sentiment, humorously anachronistic dialogue, and expensive Colonial Williamsburg sets.The Patriot has the look and feel of an epic, but none of the actual feeling that would make it memorable leaving it to rank as a major disappointment.Gibson gives a mechanically precise but soulless performance in which he seems more concerned with how he looks than what his character is thinking or feeling.Its makers and star have produced a hackneyed piece of patriotic gore.I had an ugly feeling when I left the theater, like someone was trying awfully hard to sell me on patriotism.The period d\u00e9cor and costuming and production design may be in the overhoned Hollywood classic style, but the plotting is pure melodrama.So the result -- in spite of the puffy white shirts, mussed ponytails, 13-starred American flags and nameless slaves -- feels more like 1996.There's no majesty, no tragedy, no feeling here; it's all FX and costuming and casting directors.The fireworks amount to little more than a fizzle.Gibson gives the part his all, but he can't create a coherent character: the movie won't let him.The next time Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich decide to crank out another of their manipulative popcorn epics, I hope they'll stick to aliens and giant lizards and leave our history alone.It seems certain that whatever extraordinary ingredients are necessary to fashion a 1776 home run, this movie doesn't have them.I particularly disliked the manipulative way the film used Martin's children as the primary vehicle to raise the dramatic stakes.Robert Rodat's script is specious and false on every level.It's not being unpatriotic to wish for a better, more original movie.The film is undeniably handsome ... but no clich\u00e9 is left unturned.Yet for its real virtues, The Patriot is never completely satisfying.The film feels preachy, hollow, and -- in its celebratory staging of violence -- flatly hypocritical.It pummels history into a series of rousing or disgusting moments.Big, dumb, predictable, too long....an honest depiction of warfare that focuses on characters and symbols.Make no mistake about it: The Patriot is a cartoon, even if it does have real people playing the parts.By the time Martin begins waving around a gigantic American flag to rally his supporters for one last clash, the film has become so mechanical and jingoistic you might just as well be watching \"Declaration of Independence Day.\"Emmerich's battle scenes may look authentic to anyone who has ever stared hard at a history book, but in every other way the film is long, empty and bogus.It's near sadistic how the film has him going though so much tragedy and self-questioning, but Gibson delivers emotionally.It's a spectacular, well-made epic that I just could not enjoy -- at least not after the first hour.A stunning-looking, undeniably compelling but empty-headed shoot 'em up.Its convictions may be half-baked, but it has the courage of them.O filme apresenta claros ind\u00edcios de que Roland Emmerich est\u00e1 amadurecendo.La pel\u00edcula est\u00e1 muy bien realizada, pero, por desgracia est\u00e1 realizada al m\u00e1s puro estilo Hollywood.Huge, handsome and compelling in scope, but also, unfortunately, convoluted and historically inaccurate -- not to mention looong.As long as it stays on the battlefield, The Patriot is a brutishly compelling broad-canvas entertainment.See it, enjoy it, and try not to think too hard about what might have been.I enjoyed the strength and conviction of Gibson's performance, the sweep of the battle scenes, and the absurdity of the British caricatures.It's a cornball epic, but it sweeps you along against your better judgment.I would like to say to Devlin and Emmerich that they have hereby been forgiven for Godzilla.A grand yarn with a sense of the weight of history and an awareness that the winners are often those who have lost the most.Deserves a salute as the first Hollywood epic about the American Revolution to successfully blend ferocity and feeling.There's some good stuff here -- far more than one would think, considering the source -- but it never quite puts it all together.The American Revolution - in comic book form.It's for the consumers of delicious Made In America hokum.Watching this movie is like watching fireworks in some grandly appointed public place.Simply looks amazing from the first frame to the last.The Patriot approaches the grandeur of the better John Ford films, echoing the master's blend of action, humor, sentiment and patriotic idealism.The Patriot is a huge, bloody, 2-hour-and-40-minute battle epic, lavishly appointed and beautifully shot.While it's easy to sound cynical in describing this paint-by-numbers plot, The Patriot is, by and large, well-made and enjoyable.Gibson is the main draw, and he provides ample reason for that with an on-fire performance that exceeds the limitations of the material.The look and premise of a South Carolina farmer should be far enough away from the tartans and kilts of Scotland that this film will be able to stand ably on its own in the public's eye.Gibson has proven he can do this kind of stuff with his eyes closed and he is rounded out by a fine supporting cast.This isn't just some ordinary war movie.A walloping entertainment.A solid effort for everyone involved.Contiene los elementos b\u00e1sicos de toda cinta \u00e9pica: una estrella en el rol principal, hermosas mujeres y grandes batallasThe Patriot comes across strong with some excellent supporting performances, oftentimes breathtaking cinematography and a plot that, like it or not, does tap many emotions.The storyline remains engaging to the very last shot.Exciting and entertaining as any good summer blockbuster should be.Gibson gives a fine, emotionally charged performance as the brave and often tormented hero.For all its adherence to formula, The Patriot is certainly handsome and effectively rousing in small but resounding ways.It has everything you want in an epic.A good film.",

        "document": "A pitiful grab bag of awful with a torturous sense of humor, crash landing a formerly inoffensive franchise into hostile Friedberg/Seltzer territory.If AIRPLANE! was Mad Magazine at its absolute best, a real genius work of insanity, SCARY MOVIE V is an issue you don't bother trying to get back after the teacher confiscates it.The \"Scary Movie\" franchise has never been known for its highbrow comedy, but this latest installment feels especially juvenile and pointless.There are opportunities to have a good time with this film, if you are a forgiving sort.Spoofing movies ranging from Black Swan to Mama to Paranormal Activity, this installment of the profitable series is woefully, painfully unfunny.Spoofs always break the rule of half-mocking something stale, but I had no idea we needed a minimum amount of time needed before a reference.These movies grow shorter and less funny by the year.When you find yourself wishing there was more Lindsay Lohan in a movie, you know it's bad. SCARY MOVIE 5 is so bad that a DJ spinning a pizza instead of a record is what passes for a sight gag. Or a woman having sex with a microwave...If it's even possible, Scary Movie 5 is worse than its predecessors, reaching all new heights of stupidity and fall-flat comedy.The best part of Scary Movie 5 -- not counting the part when it's over -- comes near the beginning.Like so much of this whole series, the mere mention of a familiar pop culture figure or title is supposed to be hilarious.Scary Movie 5 must be some kind of psychological experiment. Perhaps the filmmakers sat in a lab, rubbing their temples while wondering aloud how awful they could make a movie and still score at the box office.A hate crime against cinema, a ringing indictment of the depths commercialism will go to in search of the lowest common denominator.yap yap yap yap yap...I have been to funerals a LOT less sad than this laughless 85 minutes. (Complete Content Details for Parents also available)Scary Movie 5 is a dumbed down and hollow version of the franchise formula - resulting in an idiotic (and unamusing) attempt at parody that is tedious not fun.Don't. Don't go see this. Don't subject yourself to this. Don't subject your brain to this. Don't give these people your money and encourage them to make more of this.It's crude, gross and probably wishes it was offensive but comes across as just lazy, limp and unfunny.A boldly uninspired torrent of halfhearted slapstick, interminable poop jokes, and pointless pop-culture references, a veritable tsunami of idiocy.Railing against Scary Movie V for diminishing the series' standards would be as effective as criticising Brooke Hogan for disgracing her proud family name. And yet, the fifth instalment of the Scary Movie franchise does do that.Scary Movie 5 is a reprehensible excuse of a comedy and should barely be considered a film since it's of such poor quality. They don't make a dunce cap big enough for individuals this idiotic.The writers are on auto pilot once more, relying on the \"It's familiar, so it must be funny\" routine...The only thing scary about 'Scary Movie 5' is the thought of a sequel.This franchise has steadily gotten worse and worse with #5 being the all time low.This is a big waste of time, drawing one more gasp out of a series that should have given up the ghost long ago.Enough. Please.Another pointless exercise that only served to make me deeply examine why comedy was ever funny. Next time, I'd rather just laugh.Even if you chuckle occasionally at this, it's hard to see how anyone would want to pay to see it.This is the first Scary Movie in seven years, but the formula remains unchanged, with a thin storyline linking spoofs of Hollywood hits.It says a lot about the film that the only half-laughs to be had come from Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan.The inexcusably desperate \"Scary Movie 5\" is this once-prosperous series' death rattle.Surely we have a responsibility to audiences in need of laughter, and surely we can do better than this.[A] numbingly inane if cheerfully up-to-the-minute new entry in a franchise presumed to have breathed its last seven years ago.85 or so minutes of random nonsense from filmmakers so clearly dispirited by their mercenary assignment that they seem to be running out the clock from the very first frame.You know that friend of yours, the one who can't tell even the simplest joke? Watching him struggle for 85 minutes would still be funnier than this movie.This is the sort of movie where you feel bad for Sheen and Lohan, because they hadn't actually hit rock bottom until they agreed to appear in it.A film composed almost entirely of jokes that were much funnier when you read them on Twitter years ago.Lacking a single honest laugh, this is shoddy by comparison with the other Scary Movie sequels... which throws it in a pit with Transylmania, Breaking Wind and Stan Helsing.The scariest thing about Scary Movie 5 is that it actually made me chortle less than some of the silly horror flicks it's trying to spoof!For the art-house crowd, who may, I suppose, stumble drunk into the wrong theater after too much Chardonnay, there are nods to Black Swan and 127 Hours.If I ever have to watch another Scary Movie film, I'll give up on writing, cinema, and society forever.This vapid, vulgar insult to the intelligence couldn't possibly have been tested on any focus groups. Can we all now agree that we've reached the cinematic saturation point with the rapidly-expiring, Scary Movie franchise?It's supposed to be funny, but you'd have an easier time reading a zombie's pulse than you would finding a single good laugh ...The latest installment of the slick, highly profitable parody franchise.A laughter vacuum whose race to parody the likes of Mama and the new Evil Dead remake didn't stretch to writing actual jokes.The filmmakers border on sophomoric desperation, achieving a measurable shred of humor only in the outtakes during the closing credits.Put it this way, there's a spoof of \"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\" in which gorillas throw their feces at the wall to see if it sticks, and you can't help wondering if this is actual documentary footage of the script meetings.like a sharp stick in the eyeScary Movie 5 is so bad, it makes A Haunted House look like a Seltzer/Friedberg comedy.You must have a better way to spend that $13.",

        "document": "High production value and solid performances lay enough of a spit shine on an otherwise dingy pile of drivel.As a movie seeking to tell a story, Body of Lies is a confused jumble.Russell Crowe's portrayal of an overweight, amoral CIA honcho in the Middle East thriller Body of Lies is mesmerizing, chilling, disturbing to the bone and one of the best performances of the year.Body of Lies is an A-list project with B-game results.Given the giga-talent involved -- virtuoso visualist Scott, The Departed's William Monahan adapting Washington Post columnist David Ignatius's novel -- I was hoping for something more substantive than Syriana-meets-Spy Game.On this basic premise builds a complicated story plied with onion layers of perspective and cunning.A stumbling block for myself as a big, fat American who doesn't understand all the nuances of Middle Eastern politics is that the movie was often hard to follow.Even if Body of Lies lacks a huge emotional wallop, it dishes plenty of food for thought.This is a little too slick and commanding for its own good; despite Crowe and DiCaprio's best efforts, their characters keep getting flattened by the steamroller narrative.[Ridley Scott] has few peers at keeping a complex script clear and tightly focused...Neither the location-based verisimilitude of Ridley Scott's shooting style nor the estimable Middle East expertise of source-material author David Ignatius can disguise Body of Lies as anything other than the contrived phony-baloney it is.DiCaprio (not Crowe) is in top form in Scott's fast-moving, visually vivid but dramatically uninvolving noirish geopolitical thriller that despite problems conveys the point that in the new war on terrorism information, not weaponry, is the key variable.DiCaprio gives the role plenty of brio, while Crowe -- who reportedly gained 50 pounds to play the morally and physically sloven office spook -- is agreeably obnoxious.Both complicated and compelling, Body of Lies offers an audacious glimpse at the hypocrisy and religious furor fueling a struggle most Americans recognize only as a political catch phrase -- a 'war on terror.'DiCaprio and Crowe, who both deliver excellent performances, may nevertheless be overshadowed by the outstanding turn by British actor Strong.DiCaprio helps turn what could have been a dry-as-sand Middle Eastern thriller into a compelling suspense film that questions the ethics of espionage and counterterrorism without turning sanctimonious or screedlike.The movie is an urgent current-events thriller that falls somewhere between Syriana and the Bourne movies....no matter how energetically the characters tear around the desert or barrel through the teeming souks, we remain underwhelmed.Yet in spite of the movie's high-tech veneer and its top-billed stars, Body of Lies is depressingly inert.Body of Lies is smart, sophisticated and hopelessly uninvolving.Crowe's a delight as a crafty Deputy Dawg from Arkansas; Mark Strong's Hani has an IQ to match his GQ. Surprisingly, the only undernourished part belongs to DiCaprio.Despite the dog-eared set-ups and situations, Body of Lies also has a lot going for it.Director Ridley Scott delivers a passable spy movie that has nothing to say about this region; he may as well have been directing from a monitor in his hotel suite.Ridley Scott does not reflect on causes, only on operations. Body Of Lies may engage the warrior techno-geeks, but its amorality is uninvolving.Body of Lies proves as generic as its title.While this film's themes seem to address issues of terrorism and CIA meddling, and the powerful cast suggests we're in Important Movie territory, the result is essentially just a routine spy thriller: entertaining but forgettable.Over-directed, frequently dull and ultimately disappointing thriller that wastes the talents of its two leads and strands them with a tedious script that somehow manages to be both confusing and overly simplistic.A complicated movie about the war on terror with two terrific performances and a terrific director.Perfectly workmanlike, unimpeachably prestige-y, achingly contemporary, and a near-complete failure as revelationGood solid far-fetched multiplex action-adventure fare in the Bondian mode, with awe-inspiring technology and just enough moral philosophizing laced through it to give the mind a little something to chew on.Just because it's really dense and layered doesn't mean it's good.Characters act and react with inexplicable intents and the story evolves in a manner that defies linear or random templates and certainly anything that might keep us engaged emotionally or psychologically.Thanks to its high-talent pro lineup, Body of Lies passes the time well, even if it doesn't necessarily enrich it.A cut above some of the other recent spate of Middle East-set thrillers.Mr. Scott's professionalism is, as ever, present in every frame and scene, but this time it seems singularly untethered from anything like zeal, conviction or even curiosity....should seem ripped from today's headlines. Instead it plays like a typical cat and mouse spy movie with top notch production values and a tacked on romantic angle.I'm not much of a mathematician, but you can say this one is Crowe Scott DiCaprio = DisappointmentIt's a film directed by one of the best directors in Hollywood, written by one of the best writers and has two of the best actors around. How could you go wrong?Like the intelligence officers it portrays, Body of Lies uses double-crosses and slight of hand to conceal a fairly formulaic story and a climax as offensively conventional as it gets.By the end, Body Of Lies is revealed as just another big-budget movie designed to cash in on the real-enough Middle East conflicts. It's a gangster movie without cops and criminals.Some show is made of plunging the viewer into a dense cloud of moral ambiguity, but this is mostly smoke and mirrors: while the American heroes may employ some dubious tactics, the justice of their cause is never in doubt.The complex plot is rendered with clarity and precision, the action scenes are very well staged, the suspense is palpable, and the performances are first-rate.[C]lever and subtle and demands that you pay attention, and rewards you for doing so...Russell Crowe has finally realised he's just an ordinary fat guy now, and taken a role he can accurately portray.Body of Lies is an extremely well paced, tightly wound, and intensely violent thriller. There is no damnation or congratulations here. As Russell Crowe muses as the end: \"No one is innocent\"A compelling, nail-biting spy thriller.It has none of the sweep of, say, Syriana, as if that mattered to the audience it's gunning for.Visually, the film is quite striking. Few modern filmmakers handle desert landscapes as well as Mr. Scott.Short on thrills and shorter on political insights...[Ridley] Scott's most entertaining and involving effort since 2001's Black Hawk Down.It doesn't help that those action scenes all blend together, relying overmuch on speeding convoys of big black SUVs and surveillance planes that can see you picking your nose from miles up.A certain rawness and despairing urgency is never quite achieved for the message the film wants to deliver, and so it remains a well-intentioned, well-produced, yet generally unmemorable entertainment.Passable entertainment -- but definitely not on par with the usual DiCaprio, Crowe, or Ridley Scott output.Body of Lies can't quite make up its mind whether to be an all-out thriller or a savvy political drama with something relevant to say about Muslim fundamentalism and the American response to it.But it's something of a penance to sit through, a token handwringing over American dirty tricks that's just another opportunity for Scott and co to blow stuff up.If the starry but soulless crime flick American Gangster wasn't enough to convince you Ridley Scott was a man past his prime, check out Body Of Lies - a starry but soulless terrorism movie.Body Of Lies lacks the epic sweep of Gladiator and the emotional pull of Thelma And Louise. But it's enormously competent, with a couple of fine supporting performances from Crowe and Strong.Visually the film is so undistinguished it may be time for the maker of Blade Runner to be subjected to that film's Voigt-Kampff test, to determine whether the current owner of the name \"Ridley Scott\" is real or a replicant.For all the enthralling visuals and action, the film feels garbled.Scott, at heart, is a pyrotechnician rather than a political philosopher. Sometimes, during the scenes when he shows graphic acts of torture, he seems like a two-penny shock merchant, too.Body of Lies is big and bombastic, confused and irritable - a 20th-century blockbuster struggling to adapt (too little, too late) to a 21st-century terrain.Syriana, this ain't. Ridley Scott's latest misses the scope, texture or depth to dig into the moral mess of the war on terror. But this entertaining techno-thriller feeds greedily off star performances from Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Strong.With high-class acts to match the hi-tech savvy of Scott and his trusty crew (cinematographer Alexander Witt, editor Pietro Scalia, composer Mark Streitenfeld), this is as taut and engrossing a couple of hours as you'll experience all year.Body of Lies is certainly one of most well-crafted and intellectually engaging political thrillers to come along this year.The movie has the fungible quality of the kind of book you buy for an airplane trip and toss as soon as you arrive.Anyone who actually sees Body of Lies will have a hard time taking it as seriously as audiences took Scott's Black Hawk Down.What begins as a movie suggesting the moral complexity of counterterrorism ends up feeling very much like a thriller as generic as its title.An unfocused, almost pointless spy thriller.Easily the smartest film to date about the post-9/11 'war on terror.'After Ridley's less-than-stellar stretch including Matchstick Men, Kingdom of Heaven, A Good Year and American Gangster, expectations are medium at best and Body of Lies does nothing to raise them.Anchored by an amazing performance by Leonardo DiCaprio and little else, Body of Lies limps along for over two hours, never amounting to more than a decent, if derivative nailbiter.As disturbing as it is compelling, Ridley Scott has outdone himself with his first modern-day political thriller, delivering his strongest movie since Black Hawk Down.The film lacks the urgency and, ironically, the intelligence required for something along these lines to succeed.Body of Lies is the movie Syriana and The Kingdom wanted to be.Obnoxiously typical, and only its pointlessly convoluted series of double crosses in the middle even gives it the semblance of drama.Body of Lies has nothing to say about geopolitics, the action scenes are formulaic, and DiCaprio is rarely on the screen with Crowe, who coasts through the most puzzling performance of his career.It works better as an action-adventure, thanks to Ridley Scott's knack for tightening the screws on the intensity.... a forgettable spy non-thriller ...Exciting enough while it's unfolding, but it lacks an original element and there aren't enough scenes where Crowe and DiCaprio are playing off each other.A respectable second-rank thriller -- intelligent but muddled, action-packed but thoughtful.Body of Lies may not tell us anything we didn't already know about the way the US does business in the Middle East, but it's compelling nonetheless.The new Ridley Scott thriller, \"Body of Lies,\" is a misfire, but not an embarrassment. So, that's positive, I guess.There always seems to be a gunfight, torture, or fireball explosion to keep you mindlessly entertained.Lies is a turgid Middle Eastern thriller, firing blanks as an action submission and presenting a wet match to light the fire of political discourse.A passable Friday night flick.Body of Lies clicks along at an engaging pace, legibly limning its multitude of characters and even throwing in a good bit of wry humor.Oscar voters leery of voting for (gasp!) comic book movie, 'The Dark Knight,' for multiple accolades come award season finally have another option with the release of 'Body of Lies.'A bewildering mishmash of double-crosses, cover-ups, and cliches, Monahan's treatment unfortunately undermines some terrific performances and a solid outing for director Ridley Scott.Body of Lies is most alive while relishing the surveillance and communications tools abused by Hoffman, tools that supply him military intelligence, but not the smarts or scruples to effectively use it.It's solid filmmaking that, bafflingly, leaves little to talk about on the way home.A thriller that reveals the latest twists and turns in the war on terrorism.Body of Lies nearly goes too far. As it is, this heavily political thriller becomes too serious and much too dark at times, and it doesn't seem to be serious enough when it really counts.So many like-minded films have beat it to the punch that there's nothing new to offer audiences. The talents of all involved have been wasted, and so has our time.What distinguishes the book with gripping realism may not be so apparent in the cinematic context. Still, for spy calculus, action, and character realization, I assign you to see it.If you're looking for a high-tech, old-fashioned racist B-western, you've come to the right place, pilgrim.Yes, there are a couple of chase scenes, but Scott rarely shifts into high gear.More gripping to watch in the moment than enjoyable to recall at its end.The macho swagger of these US espionage interlopers around the planet has all the finesse of a wrestling ring, while imperialism is made to come off as really sexy. Body Of Lies: An Amman Gangster.Body of Lies grants Ferris the usual moral rightness -- even as he's committing questionable acts, he means well.A timely game of cat and mouse that benefits from the performances by its two leads.Like Alec Baldwin, Russell Crowe is way more fun to watch when he's fat.DiCaprio's solid, though I wonder if a real CIA agent could get away with looking so earnest every second. Crowe has the right idea, in addition to all the fun: Just throw it away, throw it away and pretty soon you build yourself a clever characterizationSo much of Body of Lies lumbers along in a lazily predictable manner.'Body of Lies' is an adults-only story about espionage and the politics of war.Ridley Scott delivers an involving if sometimes meandering spy thriller and gets in some choice digs about the paralyzed state of American intelligence in the post-9/11 age.For the most part, this is a pretty solid thriller that combines Government mumble jumble with some pretty exciting action sequences.Violent spy thriller more about style than story.Body of Lies is an expertly made, well-acted movie, and that makes it worth seeing, but it's not what it could have been.A tight, first-rate espionage thriller that casts a bleak light on American involvement in the Middle East.Isn't it time someone did a serious cost-benefit analysis on the filmmaking partnership of Russell Crowe and director Ridley Scott?Curiously lightweight...escapes neither the slick histrionics of a typical studio blockbuster nor the clumsiness that afflicts movies with political messages.It's no surprise that Leonardo DiCaprio and Russell Crowe are so good in Body of Lies, Ridley Scott's thrilling film about the war on terror, its costs and its frustrations.Makes the threats, the obstacles and the explosions seem shatteringly real.Body of Lies contains enough you can believe, or almost believe, that you wish so much of it weren't sensationally implausible.Its generic attributes (and title) notwithstanding,Scott's film may be the sharpest and most perceptive of all the post-9/11 thrillers -- and also the most purely entertaining.Body of Lies isn't half bad, sprinkling in well-shot action and some moments of genuine suspense.'Body of Lies' is a tense, deftly paced meditation on America's role in the Middle East, and if it's not quite a war movie, it offers somber insights into the Bush administration's campaign against terror that recent thrillers like 'The Kingdom' have not.There's just not much being said in 'Body of Lies.' When it comes to novel ideas, everyone gets left out in the cold.That Ridley Scott guy, he directs things pretty good.'Body of Lies' ends up being a mostly chaotic movie featuring lead characters it's hard to care about.Bloated and far-fetched, it's filled with two-and-half-hours of meandering meaninglessness.Body of Lies could've been one of those gag trailers at the beginning of Tropic Thunder.I'm usually not crazy about thrillers, but this one had me engaged from start to finish.DiCaprio plays a hero with terrible judgment, while Crowe hams up a pointless part to the detriment of the movie.Gets across a palpable sense of Iraq fatigue. Which is another way of saying it invites the audience to see the talking-Chihuahua picture instead.It's basically just an excuse for Leonardo DiCaprio to play Jason Bourne while Scott once again turns his technical expertise towards making Morocco look pretty.It's an exciting movie, done in the flashy, breath-catching hyper-visual mode we expect from Scott. But in the end, it gets bogged down ...While action-adventure conventions take precedence over socio-political analysis, visceral kicks are in short supply, a situation that throws the film's tendencies toward stale misdirection and goofy melodrama into sharp relief.The plot devolves into a potboiler, reduced to a series of sequences wherein DiCaprio and Crowe can posture with the requisite machismoThe Hollywood Surge still isn't working.Collaborating with a director who doesn't give a damn, DiCaprio and Crowe have made a political action flick totally without emotional impact.Body of Lies moves so fast you don't notice its oddball structure.Body of Lies is a riddle wrapped in an enigma served with a side of mystery meat. It's very watchable, with some entertaining action beats, kind of a Syriania as scripted by Tom Clancy, a The Kingdom with a little less C.S.I.Working from a screenplay by William Monahan, Scott takes rusty '80s clich\u00e9s from the days when we were playing nuclear chicken with Russia and retrofits them to the post-9/11 world. He exposes how weary those old spy tropes really are.It's a wonder that Body of Lies squanders all of those ingredients in a dry, convoluted mess.Like Blade Runner, the film reminds us of the corrupting nature of power, and how those who look down on others often fail to understand the consequences of their actions.Though Body of Lies hews a bit too closely to convention, it still engages throughout thanks to DiCaprio and director Scott.For those who care about there being more to a thriller than pointless car chases and over-edited fight sequences, Body of Lies offers a satisfying dose of truth.\"Body of Lies\" is an intelligent geopolitical thriller that ... is really about the manipulation of people like chess pieces on a worldwide board.DiCaprio bleeds and curses and emotes all over the desert, but the movie he inhabits seems cold, like a clockwork mechanism...It's a Mideast thriller pulsing with suspense, shootouts, explosions, flashy movie-star performances and the kind of evocative atmosphere that has made director Ridley Scott famous.This makes for a movie experience in which the viewer sits patiently for about 45 minutes waiting for the story to kick in, only to realize, oh. So this is it.Body of Lies is excessively intricate and extremely dull, the latest example of a filmmaker giving us a disjointed, overlong movie that's unnecessarily confusing to follow.Tarred with the brush of the war movie curseJust because Leonardo DiCaprio gets worked like a speed bag doesn't mean Ridley Scott isn't pulling the punches he usually packs. It's emotionless chaos that's more like \"Collateral Damage,\" less a film weighing what collateral damage really means.The fact that Roger could have turned to Ed and said, 'I got to go see about a girl,' comes close to negating the impact this film should have.It looks really good and has really great acting in it, [but it] doesn't amount to much in the end, emotionally.Hugely disappointing film, even moreso when considering the talent involved.I lost interest in this movie somewhere between the donkey crossing the road in Jordan and the donkey crossing the road in Syria.Body of Lies delivers excellent performances along with realistic action, suspense and drama.A high-priced potboiler that never comes to a boil.Despite a too-long running time, a silly Hollywood ending, and an unconvincing love interest, this is a well-made, high energy, fast-paced film loaded with tension.It's official: the Ridley Scott who created such signature visions as Blade Runner and Alien is dead and has been replaced by a pod person that churns out slick-looking, but wholly generic big-budget time-wasters.I'm still waiting for the war-on-terror thriller that has more on its mind than the threat al-Qaida poses to movie stars.The world of Body of Lies should feel chaotic and dangerous. But Scott's camera, smoothly gliding across one stately image after another, keeps assuring us everything is fine.Body of Lies is more than anything a missed opportunity -- or perhaps, given its cellular phoniness, a series of missed connections.The result isn't a lecture about American foreign policy, but a smartly updated old-fashioned espionage thriller.The plot occasionally becomes convoluted and murky, but when it trains its focus on matters of treachery and intrigue, Body of Lies is exciting and compelling.It's a study in semisimilitude, more Google-Earthly than grounded in feelings.Scott, Crowe and DiCaprio construct a sophisticated, intelligent thriller.Its chief bid at seriousness, a confrontational colloquy with the top terrorist near the end of the film, comes across as the awkward regurgitation of a hastily swallowed subscription to The Economist.A palpable tension grinds on you for a bit over two-hours and leaves you as drained as the film's characters.Doesn't tell its story clearly, and buries its most compelling aspects beneath action scenes and romantic subplots that detract from them.Unfortunately, we've seen variations on this story a dozen times.Art may be imitating life, but it sure makes for dull movies. Body of Lies is the latest example of what a crutch this has become -- show grainy satellite images, cut to a chase in a crowded bazaar, discuss 'intel'. Repeat.Body of Lies has its share of exciting moments -- Scott remains a master at directing physical action -- and it certainly couldn't be more timely. But it's also a safe and predictable movie about a subject that is neither.An apocalyptic vision of cloak-and-dagger intelligence, Lies is like a suicide note written by Tom Clancy, but the movie's gloomy inaccessibility actually makes it all the more intriguing.It's a little bit of Syriana, a lot of Traitor -- and an awful lot of scenes of people cursing into cell phones.It's a well-crafted, suspenseful effort that at least tries to appear intelligent and aware.The movie isn't witty or memorable, but it keeps you on edge, and it's the first war-on-terror film to weave its anti-U.S. politics so deeply into the narrative that the characters don't need to speechify.Body of Lies is being hailed in some quarters as a 'new' kind of war thriller. While this glitzy production may attract audiences suffering from battle fatigue, it's nothing of the sort.A well-crafted but curiously generic spy thriller that, for its final hour at least, comes off as formulaic as its title.As the film's episodic story gradually reveals itself, it ends up too unconvincing and conventional to consistently hold our attention.Lies and consequences form the heart of this bold, hard-hitting drama in which people are used as commodities, while Big Brother keeps a watchful eye -- both DiCaprio and Crowe inhabit their characters totallyConvincing and gripping, Body of Lies is at the epicentre of Ridley Scott's comfort zone as an action adventure with political overtones as well as some intimate human insightsDiCaprio works hard while Crowe does chores at home and eats.High marks also to Strong, the almost overly polite leader of the Jordanian security forces. His soft spoken demeanor attempts to mask the furiousness of his convictionsSmart and tightly drawn; it has a throat-gripping urgency and some serious insights, and Scott has a greater command of space and a more explicit way with violence than most thriller directors.\"Body of Lies\" is a cynical cinematic Kamikaze sortie where the goal is for the audience to disapprove of every smug American character and every super tricky Middle Easterner.Body of Lies is yet another in a long, tiresome line of loud, violent, nauseating and incoherent riffs on how mercenary and inhuman the spooks in the C.I.A. are, even to each other.Each character thinks that what he's doing is the right course for the greater good. But when you break down Body of Lies to its most fundamental elements, it's really about disagreeing with your boss.Leonardo DiCaprio and Russell Crowe fire up Ridley Scott's terrific political thriller, which might finally drag audiences to a flick about the War On Terror.Reaching perhaps for the artistic merit of 'Syriana,' director Ridley Scott instead unfolds a convoluted story with little wit and flat humor.B\u00e1sicamente un buen film de entretenimiento sobre un tema \"serio\" como el combate al terrorismo, armado de manera eficaz aunque superficial.Como divers\u0103o, Rede de Mentiras merece aplausos. Isto n\u0103o impedir\u00e1, claro, que ele seja relegado ao esquecimento completo dentro de poucos anos.Better than the vast majority of the post-9/11 terrorist yarns, Body of Lies is both more ambiguous and ambitious than such heavy-handed duds as Rendition and Redacted.Perhaps Scott's ever-restless shooting style doesn't quite differentiate between the peaks and troughs of the narrative, yet it's still an engrossing account of the intersection between process and ethics.For those of us who want movies to be about something and not just empty action with minimal shallow 'moral of the story' tacked on, Body of Lies is a disappointment....better than a lot of the post 9/11 espionage films that Hollywood has made.If you're going to have a mall-ready entertainment about the war on terror, you might as well have this one. [Blu-ray]When Russell Crowe gives a lackluster performance, you know how meager a year it's been at the movies. In Body of Lies, Crowe is bogged down in a thankless role in a thankless movie.Like Syriana without either the balls or the brains, Body Of Lies is perfectly presentable. You just expect better from the likes of Leo, Russ and Ridley.But despite the immaculate production values, the satire is so unspeakably crude that it ceases to matter. A shame. Scott has been an instrumental director in the Hollywood evolution of war films. But Body of Lies is a one-note rant.",

        "document": "Because I Said So is a work of comic desperation, and an especially cruel betrayal of Keaton, who looks radiant in her 60s yet keeps finding herself cast in roles that use her age as the foundation for cut-rate slapstick.Throughout most of her career Diane Keaton has shown sound instincts, so it's a mystery why she failed to sniff this false, brittle comedy out as a waste of her gifts.The brain recoils at even having to recount the ill-conceived plot.Speaking as a longtime Keaton fan, it's hard watching her go through this overbearing mother phase.[An] obnoxious, headache-inducing horror show.Avoid the movie so you won't waste 90 minutes of your life on an unfunny, derivative mess.Keaton may well be the only actress in Hollywood who could play this character without making her despicable or treacly.It's a perfect title for a film so utterly lacking in worthwhile qualities that there is no logical reason to actually see it....Keaton kneads the part until it begins to resemble a human being.There's not a member of the cast who isn't better than this premise or its execution.With Keaton in devastating overdrive, Moore can barely exercise her own brand of ginchiness.Playing a ditzy control freak of a mother with serious boundary issues, Keaton comes across as such a screeching, flailing flibbertigibbet that you want to give her costars tranquilizer dart guns.Keaton is a national treasure, always worth the visit even when, as is the case of Because I Said So, her movie isn't.Every year Hollywood trots out a movie like this on Super Bowl Weekend. A movie by, of, and for women. Because I Said So, though, is like the work of some narrow-casting, niche-marketing mad scientist.There's a charming bonhomie among the sisters, and there are cute touches to the romances.There's not a scene in its ode to dating-quota acceptability and capitalist victory that isn't awful.The movie plays out like a freshman film school project with a big budget; it's very pretty to look at and every plot twist is telegraphed with painful precision.Any relationship between the world of Because I Said So and actual human behavior is purely coincidental.The jokes are crude and repetitious.Call it a hunch, but I don't think you're going to see a clip from the appalling romantic comedy Because I Said So at this spring's Diane Keaton tribute at Lincoln Center.Because ends up a joyless, patronizing, and obnoxious 100-minute-long commercial for matricide.The film contains no laughs, no purpose, and no entertainment.I kind of felt sorry for Keaton while watching this.this film is like Kevin Federline at the guidance counselor's office - it just has no directionAn exercise in canned cuteness.Because I Said So is an exercise in deliberate mediocrity, with chuckles and heartwarming moments distributed as carefully as nuts in a factory-made brownie.Do mothers really ask their daughters about orgasms?Keaton capably pulls off even the silliest slapstick... (but) practically everything in 'Because' is spelled out in the simplest terms, set in bold typeface and then marked with a highlighter pen, lest we miss the meaning.A predictable, strident and unfunny mass of clich\u00e9s.BECAUSE I SAID SO is undone by its uneven screenplayBelieve me when I tell you not to see this unless you're subpoenaed. It's that bad!Diane Keaton's dizzy iconoclast shtick was kind of cute, rather endearing, and even a little feminist 30 years ago. Now it's just nails-on-a-chalkboard obnoxious.Another example of filmmakers insulting the intelligence of their audienceDefinitely not funny, and not appropriate for young teenagers! Yuck!Diane Keaton has a lot to answer for in her willingness to portray Hollywood's idea of middle-aged womanhood.What was Diane Keaton thinking when she signed on to play a shrill, off-putting mother whose unbelievable, over-the-top antics are utterly annoying to watch? Even the title is annoying.It's so derivative, unfunny and thuddingly bad that it's one of the more cringe-inducing movies of a genre chock-full of clunkers.As almost everyone knows by now, the early part of the year has become a dumping ground for dreadful movies. Still, Because I Said So constitutes unusually toxic waste.Bette Davis and Joan Crawford, when they reached a certain age, played harridans and ax murderers. Diane Keaton has started playing mothers, but, alas, the effect is about the same: She's scary. Very scary.Spark? Romance? Wit? Nope, sorry.Wince-inducing.What the filmmakers try to play for laughs isn't funny, it's creepy.You get what you expect with some funny scenes, a couple of make-you-weep scenes and plenty of female bonding....Keaton [delivers] a painfully over-the-top, tic-ridden performance...Apparently retrieved from a dumpster, labeled \"Rejected Sitcom Brain Farts,\" at the Universal back lot and Scotch-taped back together, the screenplay can only be described as a crime against moviegoers worldwide.scattershot and misbegotten by even normal romantic comedy standardsIf these are the only kinds of roles we can conceive for actresses who have grown into their faces, as Keaton has, it's no wonder so many younger performers are seeking the knife.A depressing example of what passes for a 'woman's picture' in a not exactly woman-friendly media era.It's barely February, but it's hard to imagine how the movie year could possibly produce a more annoyingly stupid movie.The whole movie feels pushy.In lieu of plot, it's cluttered with bad driving scenes, dog reaction shots, falling-splat-with-cakes scenes, and watching old movies scenes.An hour into the film, my girlfriend leaned over and whispered, \"I wish she (Mandy Moore) would just go ahead and punch her mother (Diane Keaton).\"Though it is far from perfect, I'm giving it a pass... once you get a little distance from the pandering, the movie kind of takes off.Filled with characters you'd thankfully only find in a bad romantic comedy, Because I Said So is an unbelievable, unenjoyable mess.Whatever you do, don't go see this movie. Why? Because I said so.Recycling every cliche in the rom-com handbook, it's clear from the very first that Lehmann has sacrificed his characters on the altar of sappy endings. What a waste -- for everybody.[A] trite, manipulative, excruciating nightmare of female pyschosis and idiocy presented as feminine adorableness.The cast is too talented for the likes of this.Even the film's costume designer makes Keaton look ridiculous which is no mean feat given that she's clothed in the actress's own style.An unfunny comedy about an interfering mother and a dysfunctional family that demeans women big time.The story plays out like a really raunchy episode of Petticoat Junction.Diane Keaton has delivered many terrific film performances, but her over-the-top work in 'Because I Said So' isn't one of them.The days when Woody Allen told Keaton there was nothing wrong with her character that couldn't be cured 'with Prozac and a polo mallet' are long gone here.It's hard to find a more stalwart movie monster in the last ten years than Keaton, who's gone from a charming neurotic to a cobwebbed, cell-phone-wielding vagina dentata.Fairly annoying from start to finish, primarily because Keaton is still relying on that ever less-endearing assortment of addlepated antics which won her an Academy Award for Annie Hall back in 1978.If you don't expect too much of it, you may find yourself pleasantly -- all right, soothingly -- surprised by it.The only time Keaton is tolerable is when she's not saying anything at all, the result of laryngitis.A romantic comedy that will make you hate both romance and comedy... oh, and also women.It's inadequate to say that this film stars Keaton; more accurately, it has befallen her, and it's hard to imagine what she did in a previous life to amass such a huge (presumably now resolved) karmic debt.It would be forgivable if the film was trying to be representative of real life. But it's not.Because I Said So's biggest sin is that it treats its characters like idiots, with Keaton's Daphne leading the charge. [She's] a woman who apparently makes her living by baking the occasional cake, most of which land on the sidewalk or in her face.The plot is about as revelatory as a bad Hallmark card, and the lowest common denominator humor results in a moviegoing experience that's almost as appealing as having a conversation with my mother about orgasms.On screen or in real life, meddling moms don't get more neurotically ebullient than Diane Keaton's dessert maven in the regrettable 'Because I Said So.'Everyone here is a caricature, and the gaps are papered over with hyperactive shtick. I haven't seen so many cakes dropped or smashed since I Love Lucy.A movie that's so bad, it's actually painful to sit through.Lehmann manages to give his characters a little bit more personality than is the norm in such movies, but he doesn't bother to hide the contrived paces he puts them through.A bog standard all-girls-together comedy with a decent cast and less impressive characters.Towards the end, the spectacle of Milly faking an orgasm for her mother's edification is, frankly, enough to kill anyone's hopes of romance.Some of the nonsense could be overlooked as part of rom com conventions, but Because I Said So's shrillness makes for an exhausting experience....the writers and director go out of their way to make [Diane Keaton] look ridiculous, pathetic and stupid...It's appropriate that much of Because I Said So is set in a bakery, because even in a sea of awful chick flicks, this appalling confection takes the cake.An unbelievable mess....appears to have been made from the parts of other films...If you're attracted to the classic fairy tale of the young maiden torn between the prince & the pauper and you don't mind a racy modern update to it, you'll have a blast.The screenplay for Because I Said So may be short on invention but it is large on heart.Keaton gives a manic, slapstick performance that alternates between being merely bad and being embarrassingly bad. Her work has an unbearable finger-across-the-blackboard effect.The entire project seems like a diabolical conspiracy to destroy one of the few icons we've got left, but luckily that's where it fails most of all.The premise . . . isn't particularly innovative. It is, however, stretched paper thin with characters whose only allegiance to consistency is getting through the uniformly unfunny joke at handRelentlessly exhaustive, simple-minded, unoriginal and inconsequential Because I Said So seems very disconnected in its bid for cockeyed conviction.Everything about Because I Said So screams out generic chick flick -- and we do mean scream, literally -- from the forgettable title to the excruciatingly corny ending.If you're a mother or a daughter some of it may resonate, but how apt that this painful, toothless farce was originally dreamt up at the dentist...A shocking embarrassment for all concerned, this is a badly written, badly acted and poorly directed mess from start to finish.Just a few years ago, Keaton played a character who was sexy, funny and intelligent in Something's Gotta Give. This one's more like Something Gave Out.A bit like the 'Friends' episode in which Phoebe has to choose between two men, only with Diane Keaton, and fewer laughs.If there's a worse screenplay in 2007 than this offering from Karen Leigh Hopkins and Jessie Nelson, it'll be written in crayon.There's a special circle of hell reserved for whoever thought up the moment where Macht tells Moore she smells like \"cake batter\".At one point Daphne warns Milly, \"You're going to end up like some pathetic character in a Tennessee Williams play.\" If ever a film could have used a character from a Tennessee Williams play, it's this one.Treats women like idiots and men like inflatable sex toys.Laughter is largely absent from this sorry, shrieking mess.I've been giving it a great deal of thought and come to the conclusion that the squandering of Diane Keaton's screen legacy is without parallel in the annals of cinema.Welcome to the rom-com in the age of Must Love Dogs.Stay home. Because I said so.Innocuous, self-centered and disconnected from any parcel of meaningful human experience.It's almost hard to believe that this bland, fluffy, two-generational chick flick is helmed by the same director who 20 years ago gave us Heathers, one of the brightest and sharpest femme-driven high-school satires.I am about to issue a declaration that amounts to blasphemy among many film critics, fashionistas and women of a certain age: I am so over Diane Keaton.It's a shame, because pop star Moore continues to prove herself an adept actress.It's safe to say that it wastes the talents of a good cast -- one that definitely deserves better than this.The cake that lands in Keaton's face isn't the only confection that turns up in this movie about the romantic life of a caterer, but there's nothing genuinely sweet about it.Because I Said So exasperates because even its best intentions are phony.My mom said I should save my money and catch this on video later.Keaton is almost unwatchable in embarrassing scenes that involve an over-the-top car chase and a computer with a mind of its own.The line between hysterical and hysterics is a thin one, and, although it has its funny moments, for the most part the tone and timbre of Because I Said So falls soundly on the wrong side.Every clich\u00e9 that's ever been in a romantic comedy appears tossed into Because I Said So and delivered by very unfunny actresses.Ultimately, even a vivacious Diane Keaton can't make a familiar film feel fresh -- no matter how hard she tries.With very little rewriting and a different director in charge, Because I Said So could have been retooled as a horror thriller. ... That version probably would have been funnier, too.A desperate comedy whose frequently acute insights into tense, but loving mother-daughter relationships is constantly hamstrung by ill-advised forays into physical humor and too much reliance on Diane Keaton's mania.I don't think anyone actually wrote Because I Said So; I think that some Hollywood artificial intelligence think-tank instead fed DVD box sets of The Gilmore Girls and Sex and the City into a computer, along with Pottery Barn catalogs for roughage. ...At 61, Diane Keaton is still doing her ditzy, girlish thing, but the act is getting a little oppressive and rarely more so than in Because I Said So, an indulgent comedy.each character in the film is so shallow and cold that there's nobody for the audience to cheer on.There's more than enough material here to make an enjoyable drama about a mother and her adult daughters. But the writers and director fail on virtually every front.In this unwatchable romantic comedy from director Michael Lehmann Diane Keaton plays Daphne Wilder, an inept mother of three pretty but not-believable-as-siblings daughters.As well as providing lifestyle porn, the many scenes set in stylish kitchens mean there is usually a cake on hand for somebody to be splattered with. That's the level of the bland attempts at comedy.[A] better movie might have surfaced if everyone had taken their Ritalin and calmed down.I hated this movie. I think it's the worst performance of Diane Keaton's career.It's a lame duck of a film.A light-weight comedy about mothers and daughters, Because I Said So is a bit like the chocolate souffl\u00e9s that Mandy Moore's Milly cooks throughout. It's light and fluffy, but on occasions it does not rise to the occasionThis movie manages to be offensive and yet dull and predictable, as phony as a Kate Spade sidewalk knock-off bag and as unoriginal as the ready-for VH1 soundtrack.Because I Said So seems like it's supposed to be a paean of sorts to motherhood and the enduring love that entails, a love so strong that it inevitably drives its possessor somewhat batty. But what it is, is muddled crap.Like steel pins poking through the eyesThe ensuing cycle of miscommunication is endless and trying.There are chick flicks and upchuck flicks. The movie Because I Said So is an upchuck chick flick.This is a by-the-book chick flick we're talking about, but the writers and director apparently didn't want to push the envelope when it came to the supporting characters -- or the main characters.Because I Said So isn't very funny, and no amount of having Diane Keaton act all post-menopausally zany is going to create the tension that just isn't there.Matricide.What makes this seem sad instead of simply silly is the way Keaton throws herself into this slop.There are lots of cakes involved in the film, and each time one shows up you know it's likely to be thrown, fallen on, dropped or pressed into someone's face.One of those rare movies that is so fantastically, fabulously bad, so bursting full of putrid dialogue and appalling scenes, that it becomes worth seeing as some sort of artifact of horribleness.Diane Keaton should stay away from such derivative, degrading roles.The result is a 105-minute cringe-a-thon that reduces the Katharine Hepburn of her generation to a sitcom harpy presiding over a brood of Valley Girl chicks.My motherly advice is: Skip it.It could have been an enjoyable light comedy, or a dark tale of obsession, but it doesn't work.As a member of their generation, and one who considered them among the best actresses of Hollywood's most probing era, I am both cheered and alarmed by the recent spectacles Jane Fonda, Susan Sarandon and Diane Keaton have made of themselves.It's still no fun to watch one of our best veteran film actresses flailing so much.The search for true love is the backbone of romantic comedy as well as the lifeblood of match.com, but this film's clumsy, completely inauthentic portrayal of it is handled in a shockingly tedious fashion.The worst date movie since Saw III.A shallow rom-com that's not just eager but frantic to please.Because I Said So is a movie about people we don't like doing things no one would ever do.The best moments aren't belly laughs (there are a couple of those, too) but the jokes that ring uncomfortably true.The only good use for Because I Said So would be as a step-by-step handbook on how not to make a romantic comedy.A gruesome chick flick with a good performance by Mandy Moore and terrific music that has been relegated to the background.Lehmann must've hoped Keaton's appealing daffiness would offset the character's repulsive behavior, but it doesn't.I spent the bulk of the running time thinking of creative ways for the characters to be murdered.The only thing you can't fault in Because I Said So is Keaton's integrity, as she commits herself completely to a disastrous role.Diane Keaton deserves so much better.",

        "document": "An agonisingly sincere drama of familial dysfunction, this is notable for some very basic miscasting.Doesn't really have a plot, but it cleverly traces the interrelationships in a family over several years, and really gets under the skinThe cast are uniformly good; it's all competent, but its somehow not completely satisfactory.Julia Roberts, Willem Dafoe and Emily Watson are strictly slumming it in this saccharine melodrama.This is a slog of a melodrama. And with at least four sob stories competing for space, characters are left dangling like untied shoelaces, as backstories remain unfertilised.A movie tomb in which zombiedom is confused with - what's the phrase? - \"nuanced performances\". Fireflies may be a douche to freshen up the thesp skills of A-listers, but why do we have to suffer for their art?A watchable but ultimately blah family drama.They stagger down memory lane for a little bloodletting, inspect skeletons in the cupboard and invariably end up bathing together in a hot tub of sentimental forgiveness and understanding.A resolutely middlebrow dysfunctional family melodrama, it's one of those tediously self-congratulatory movies that projects an unearned air of superiority simply because it's not another slam-bang summer blockbuster.We're in the twilight land of the sensitive indie ensemble piece, something American stars gravitate to for reasons of range and prestige, but which ends up being more cathartic for them than for us.There's a sense of emotional paralysis about Dennis Lee's Fireflies in the Garden.the only thing more false in \"Fireflies in the Garden\" than its flaccid melodrama is its clich\u00e9d emotional redemption.Despite an A-list roster, the performances are universally one-note, a fact largely attributable to a script overflowing with blunt dialogue and heavy-handed symbolism.It's a tragedy, in all of the wrong ways.Dennis Lee's sentimental drama is full of big stars and good intentions but still winds up feeling no better than a tear-jerking television soap opera.Despite the mega-wattage of pic's starry cast, theatrical prospects seem dim for this clumsy melodrama, which looks and sounds no better than an average made-for-cabler.The movie is one long argument, tiresome and repetitive, that produces more heat than light.As tales of troubled families go, it may have aspirations to be like Ordinary People, but it falls way short.It lacks dramatic impact and fails to deliver the required emotional punch.The entire experience feels like it is leading up to a dramatic and well-needed climax, but sadly this never materialises and what we're left with is a run-of-the-mill yarn, albeit one with a stellar cast.Julia Roberts plays ultra-sensitive artiste Ryan Reynolds' noble mother-and that should basically tell you all you need to know about this misguided soapy bunch of bollocks which somehow made its way off the shelf into theatres.This locally shot weeper is unhappy in myriad ways, few of which manage to coalesce around its heart-stung core.Uneven drama about unhappy family, including tragedy.This histrionic family drama must have looked good on paper to attract such a big-name cast, but on the screen it comes off as glib, rushed, and underdeveloped.A dreadful exercise in navel-gazing that resides in a particularly trite corner of Pat Conroy-ville.A dispiriting rehash of dysfunctional family clich\u00e9s that seems to last longer than Thanksgiving Day dinner.The emotional effectiveness varies from moment to moment between not pushing too hard or simply not pulling hard enough.This stale drama is finally getting a limited release and will prove just how limited it is to the poor saps who pay to see it.The actors are all good and a few scenes -- an opening family argument, a crucial battle when Michael finally fights back -- are painfully moving.An unrelentingly grim drama about yet another dysfunctional family.A sickly sweet family drama stuffed with exceptionally high-profile performers - so much so that they threaten to overwhelm it just by their presence.A heavy, entertaining but slightly forgettable family drama.The elements are all there but never fully click into place - more like a TV movie than a big-screen drama.It may be both both melancholy and intense but it packs an emotional jolt as the prodigal son reaches an understanding - if not a full-blown reunion - with his crotchety old man.A thoughtful tale but it is not original enough to provide a long-lasting glow.Lee doesn't trust his storytelling or the audience.\"Fireflies\" is probably too convoluted to pave the way for more roles of this sort, but watching Reynolds get inside Michael's pain, you hope it won't be long until something will.Those who naturally gravitate to this syrupy genre shouldn't be disappointed, as Fireflies in the Garden is consistent with tender moments and agonized recollections.Has all the personality and forward momentum of a cardboard box.Just when you're hitting your tolerance breaking point for these people and their nonstop bellyaching and yelling and baffling hatred for one another, the equally baffling reconciliation kicks in. What just happened?The constant shifting between past and present is handled so badly that it adds absolutely nothing to the proceedings.It just comes off a little false.A sheer slog to sit through, Fireflies In The Garden might have worked if it wasn't so damn po-faced and the script actually had something to say about how families work.Consistently watchable and sometimes rather moving, although it is a rather slighter piece than the film-makers seem to think.The relationships are lived-in and complex, with the same hopelessness that we find in real life. People don't change.[A] middling effort about the fights and reconnections experienced by a family gathered due to an unexpected tragedy...A fraught family drama that shows us the same family in past and present, 22 years apart. It might have been more effective if it had followed a chronological order.An impressive ensemble lends heft and humour to this sprawling potboiler. Watchable if never truly memorable, it's a mid-range work for most involved that still affords the odd guilty pleasure.It's not a bad film - Lee directs with subtle grace and the cast is predictably strong - but it's saddled with too many characters, not enough drama and a strong sense of overfamiliarity.",

        "document": "This was Switzerland's entry for the 2006 Oscars, and you can see why. Like most award-seeking crowd-pleasers, it places uncomfortable impulses in opposition then dramatizes them in the most unchallenging way imaginable.Veteran Swiss filmmaker Fredi M. Murer's sentimental fable about a child prodigy and his difficulty fitting in with a world of ordinary people is poised somewhere between Searching For Bobby Fisher and Little Man Tate.Genius weighs heavily on a child prodigy who longs to be 'normal' in this charming Swiss import from veteran director Fredi M. Murer.considers the adult world, and the genius coming of age in it, with delicacy, compassion, and the subtle humor of the human comedy at large.A good last half makes up for a slow first half...watching the incredibly talented Gheorghiu play the piano (is) worth the price of admission.Murer is a skillful director and has crafted a crowd-pleasing story that will have particular appeal to mature 'tweeners.A lot more interesting, and challenging, than its premise suggests.Some of the moments of whimsy seem calculated specifically to cut together a theatrical trailer.Vitus's cool intelligence, knotty narrative and precise performances make it a pleasure to watch even when it sends mixed messages about the true nature of its protagonist.Vitus, a fizzy domestic fairy tale from Switzerland, gives you a lift, as it revels in the oddball joy of genius as kid power.Anyone who's been or borne a gifted child will smile with recognition at Vitus, which always keeps us guessing but connected to the young superman of the title.It's a simple, gentle tale that pulls its audience in almost imperceptibly; by its end, you just might be blinking away unexpected tears.Its heart is never anywhere but in the right place.A good example of making the differences work for you. Deep down, this is a film about childhood dreams and the determination to make those dreams come true. With such a positive message, you can't help yodeling on your exit from the theater.... inconsequential fun that sells out the human story with an abrupt third-act turn from childhood rebellion to junior con game.If you suspend your disbelief, you will be rewarded with fine performances and a feel-good message that isn't cloying or sentimental.There are some likable elements to this unusual, erratic, ultimately frustrating film.The more sentimentally inclined in the audience may even feel like applauding.[A] celebratory, family-friendly fable.Vitus freaks you out, but its makers seem to have no idea that it does.Although a tad sentimental, Vitus is charming and smart in how it deals with its fascinating central character, a very young child prodigy, and the problems he experiences because of his overheated brain power.'Vitus' could show a blank screen, play the soundtrack, and still be more intelligent than half the movies at the multiplex.It is the rare family film that never condescends and offers enough of a story to entertain both parent and child.Old-fashioned but enjoyable and touching, the Swiss Vitus contributes to a growing body of films about dilemmas faced by a child prodigy and his parents, much in the vein of Seraching for Bobby Fischer; as the boy's grandfather, Bruno Ganz is terrificOne soaring performance not nearly enoughVitus packs an emotional wallop of the standing ovation variety during its final 20 minutes, even if the road there is long and windy.The film is charming and often funny, but under all that sweetness are some very sharp observations about contemporary life.Director Fredi Murer strains too hard for it to be something more, a magical opus about childhood and taking flight, in this instance literally and figuratively. You wind up feeling manipulated instead of emotionally moved.While the metaphor here may be too literal for some tastes, Murer shows how our families also give us the wings to fly.If I had to select one movie genre to never withstand again, it would be the precocious- child-shows- adults-the- way-to- a-better- more-heartwarming- future drama, a genre the new Vitus practically defines.Gheorghiu's bad-seed severity has a creepy undercurrent.The cast is superb, especially the young actors who portray Vitus; [Teo] Gheorghiu is a real-life piano prodigy, lending an extra frisson to the intoxicating music that plays throughout the film.In addition to the rich classical music on its score (with piano solos played by Gheorgiu who is a real-life musical prodigy), the film boasts strong performances by Ganz as the understanding grandparent and Jenkins and Jucker as the boy's parents.A touching and inspirational fantasy, buoyed by splendid music and considerable humor.We're supposed to be convinced that [Vitus has] proved himself a normal kid in spite of his virtuoso skills, not because of them. It's a bit of a stretch, but he's got the long fingers for it.Directed with a conspicuous lack of inspiration.As a parable of fairy-tale genius coping with a world of normality, Vitus is enriching satire.As in Full Moon, director Fredi M. Murer brings a delicately sweet but never cloying sensibility.The film pushes an off-putting message about unchecked privilege that reeks of capitalist pigdom.An enchanting Swiss movie about a musical prodigy and his loving grandfather who nurtures his dream and gives him the space to be himself.To those of us for whom there can never be enough film dramas with a classical music backdrop, Vitus comes as a bit of a disappointment.a sort of goofy espionage sans a villain with a ridiculous haircut.Even cynics might find it hard to resist.A charming coming-of-age drama featuring a protagonist who becomes a modern-day anti-Icarus.If writer-director Fredi Murer had sparked a more rebellious spirit within the project, he might have made a truly memorable fantasy for both children and adults.There are few movies more infuriating than those that completely misjudge our reaction to their main characters -- and Vitus, alas, is at the head of that class.Pic is a fine example of old-fashioned story-telling and also will dance wherever detailed character development and leisurely-paced drama are appreciated.Director/co-writer Fredi M. Murer provides some whimsically absurd twists in this gentle observation of the travails of growing up.[An] appealing and crowd-pleasing film.The less you know about the storyline the better, but there are elements of a buddy movie, a super scam, and love story in this film about a 12 year old wunderkind who has the smarts to make his dreams soarOh, yes. I loved the music, but it's almost impossible to go wrong with Bach and Schumann.Like a gifted youngster, 'Vitus' doesn't fulfill its potential....fairy tales are really horror shows, and the idea of children as anything other than miniature adults with the full complement of ugly motives is a relatively recent one.Newcomer Teo Gheorghiu does a fantastic job of bringing the title character to life...[Twelve-year-old lead actor] Gheroghiu's subtle acting ... makes the somewhat fantastical plot threads that drive the second half of the film believable, and turns what was a somewhat bloodless family drama into a cleverly constructed tale void of life-afUna pel\u00edcula interesante, si bien no original, sobre lo que significa crecer siendo un ni\u0144o prodigio. Sorprendentes actuaciones de los peque\u0144os protagonistas, junto al veterano y experto Bruno Ganz.I alternately wanted to slap and hug the majority of the characters",

        "document": "Both an admirable reconstruction of terrible events, and a fitting memorial to the dead of that day, and of the thousands thereafter.Easily stands alongside such throat-clutching classics of cinematic political action as Z and The Battle of Algiers.The moral shrapnel and mental shellshock will linger long after this film has ended.Bloody Sunday has been rightly compared to movies like Costa-Gavras' Z ... Like them, it doesn't dramatize or reenact history so much as throw us back into it and make us feel it in our bones.Greengrass gives the film a brawling, bruising intimacy that makes the graphic finale hard to watch.Rarely do gunshots elicit such shock. Rarely does violence feel so horrific.It's an extraordinary adrenaline-pumping immersion into historical events, and goes along way to explain the bitterness that has resounded from that day.The film ranks right up there with The Battle of Algiers and Culloden in the convincing pseudodocumentary department.Would that Greengrass had gone a tad less for grit and a lot more for intelligibility.A compelling, gut-clutching piece of advocacy cinema that carries you along in a torrent of emotion as it explores the awful complications of one terrifying day.As an act of filmmaking, it is superb: A sense of immediate and present reality permeates every scene.Made with full you-are-there, hand-held camera work, and it's not a film for the faint-hearted.it's certainly worth riding the rough whirlwind digital camera for insights that U2 can only hint at.What's most striking about Greengrass' film is just how real it all feels.Director Paul Greengrass does an excellent job at crafting a documentary feel for the story, complete with grainy film, jumpy shots, wavering sound and naturally gray light.Bloody Sunday has the grace to call for prevention rather than to place blame, making it one of the best war movies ever made. It's a movie that accomplishes so much that one viewing can't possibly be enough.Greengrass (working from Don Mullan's script) forgoes the larger socio-political picture of the situation in Northern Ireland in favour of an approach that throws one in the pulsating thick of a truly frightening situation.Little more than a well-mounted history lesson.The film transports us back in time.Greengrass has achieved such immediacy that it's hard to believe that what we're watching isn't really unfolding before our eyes.The film could have been one of the year's finest, if only it was more accessible.The handheld camerawork and bleached-out color palette suggest something more akin to combat footage, and candid moments recorded on the sly give Bloody Sunday a chilling realism.A solidly told and streamlined cinematic experience that's nothing short of gripping.What Bloody Sunday lacks in clarity, it makes up for with a great, fiery passion.Bloody Sunday not only is a classic study in the way things can go devastatingly, violently wrong, but also a lesson in the importance of not letting that happen.With a grainy, documentary look, the movie brings to life a tragic event and leaves an impression that is impossible to forget.It's raw, visceral stuff that precious few movies are capable of equaling.Leaves you dazed and shaken, as if you, too, had been caught in the swirl of events that led to unspeakable sadness and a lot more bloodshed.A movie to remember.Watching the day's events of Bloody Sunday unfold in edgy, as-it's-happening documentary style, the stomach knots up, the heart sinks and the grief surfaces long before any bullets fly into the backs of fleeing, unarmed Catholic slum dwellers.It's not just one of the best but also one of the most important films of the year.When it really counts ... Bloody Sunday connects on a visceral level that transcends language.The chaos of that day comes through loud and clear.As a terrifying example of what can happen when too many angry people are crowded into too small a space, it's a gripper.Shocking and visceral.It's strong stuff, brilliantly done, and carrying an emotional impact you won't soon forget. But be warned that the history it details is simplified, and it's not as completely accessible as it might have been.The film uses an artless, documentary approach to buttress its impassioned argument that soldiers treated innocent people as if they were terrorists.A potent drama that refuses to sentimentalize or romanticize the Troubles.Taut, terse and livid.It offers an important lesson about how a supposedly simple disagreement can get so far out of hand that lives are lost.This is tragedy in its rawest form: bloody chaos I couldn't help but watch. . . . The tension is palpable and the brutality is immediate.The immediacy is overwhelming...an extraordinarily powerful film.As atua\u0443\u0448es viscerais e a dire\u0443\u0441o pseudo-documental recriam com contud\u0416ncia um dos epis\u0437dios mais revoltantes da hist\u0437ria da luta irlandesa contra a domina\u0443\u0441o brit\u0420nica.Captures the horrors of a civil rights march taking a wrong turn in the Northern Ireland city of Londonderry on Sunday, January 30, 1972.The audience is placed right in the center of events in a multi-sensual, horrific 'you are there' virtual reality of social protest that grabs you and never lets go.The film exudes a universality that may apply to any conflict, especially any that provokes people to become killing machines in the name of nationalism.An amazing feat of movie making, \"Bloody Sunday\" leaves you stunned.No victories here, but Greengrass' film is a triumph in anguish.[Nesbitt's is] one of those performances that simply 'is.'A gripping experience, and often downright sickening.Intelligently crafted and often insightful.Goes some way towards explaining how the tragedy occurred and its enduring legacy today.While it's not boring or maudlin, Bloody Sunday feels gutless for not taking as strong a cinematic stance as it could.A tension-filled and heart-breaking drama about a dark day in Irish history-the massacre of 13 unarmed citizens of Derry by British soldiers out to teach them a harsh lesson about law and order.A startlingly immediate re-creation of the January 1972 Derry massacre.An authentically vague, but ultimately purposeless, study in total pandemonium.Greengrass's gripping Bloody Sunday could easily pass for a documentary on the 1972 Derry massacre is a testament to the immediacy of this v\u00e9rit\u00e9 exercise.An exceptionally accomplished historical recreation.With its jerky hand-held camera and documentary feel, Bloody Sunday is a sobering recount of a very bleak day in Derry.A dreadful day in Irish history is given passionate, if somewhat flawed, treatment.Comparisons with The Battle of Algiers are not inappropriate.Intense and difficult, but rewarding.Although originally produced for British television in 2002, Paul Greengrass's vivid depiction of a violent turning point in the so-called Troubles in Northern Ireland was released in the U.S. in theaters.Powerful retelling of 1972 demonstrations.Time has offered the Troubles perspective, investigation and pop-culture outlets (U2\u2032s \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\"). But Paul Greengrass's film spoke to how reason meant absolutely nothing when rage reigned on either side of the line.Stunning.Greengrass sacrifices character and plot to a chilling impressionistic stylization.Watching director Paul Greengrass's explosive Bloody Sunday, you have to remind yourself at moments that you're not looking at a documentary.Greengrass has deliberately chosen to provoke an emotional rather than intellectual response with his film -- but sometimes provocation is much preferred to the British media's maintenance of the status quo.Bloody Sunday demonstrates an historical thesis formulated in retrospect, which fits oddly with Greengrass's continuous-present technique.A bloody endurance test.The level of accomplishment in the filmmaking is overwhelming, because in addition to the flash-cut boldness, it's an earthy epic like Gillo Pontecorvo's Battle of Algiers.A heart pounding, moment-by-moment recreation of that awful January day.Drops you into a dizzying, volatile, pressure-cooker of a situation that quickly snowballs out of control, while focusing on the what much more than the why.The cinema verite style that Paul Greengrass' supposed historical recreation film Bloody Sunday employs opens a dangerous can of worms that I could never push back shut while watching it.Few films have captured the chaos of an urban conflagration with such fury, and audience members will leave feeling as shaken as Nesbitt's Cooper looks when the bullets stop flying.The pre-conflict story keeps it amazingly balanced, giving us brief insight to the British soldiers' fears, while the tension-filled ride that follows demands full attention.An astonishing re-creation of the Londonderry massacre of January 1972....once the true impact of the day unfolds, the power of this movie is undeniable.It re-creates a moral earthquake; it captures how the eruptive texture of that day was the product of forces that had been brewing for decades.A bracing, unblinking work that serves as a painful elegy and sobering cautionary tale.A violent collision that's unfortunately relevant to today's relentless stream of aggressive acts.Astonishingly skillful and moving...it could become a historically significant work as well as a masterfully made one.what remains is as clear an explanation as any of how a tinderbox sometimes erupts into conflagration with nothing so much as a strike.I admired this work a lot.The primitive force of this film seems to bubble up from the vast collective memory of the combatants. It's like watching a nightmare made flesh.'...the film's considered approach to its subject matter is too calm and thoughtful for agitprop, and the thinness of its characterizations makes it a failure as straight drama.'Assumes familiarity with the background of the 'troubles' and proceeds viscerally to portray the British as murderers of Irish demonstrators in 1972.A film that brings tears and anger at the futility and waste of this officially sanctioned act of murder.The result is solemn and horrifying, yet strangely detached.Greengrass' dramatic re-enactment, galvanised by documentary techniques, is so dense and alive with detail that it should be viewed attentively.Forget about the controversy: this is visceral, rocket-fuelled film-making.Whether you'd call this 'docudrama', 'faction' or 'factual drama', the result is enough to make you seethe with anger and moral outrage.A forceful and accomplished work.a gut-wrenching account of that day and all days where humans bring tragedy upon their own raceOne-sided documentary offers simplistic explanations to a very complex situation. ... Stylistically, the movie is a disaster....the makers keep it tight and interesting from beginning to end and keep the gut-clenching suspense going right through to the finale that sums up the repercussions of \"Bloody Sunday.\"A grim, startling motion picture.You're not merely watching history, you're engulfed by it.A great achievement: tense and passionate, a film that one feels not just emotionally but also physically.Brutally gripping.There is no solace here, no entertainment value, merely a fierce lesson in where filmmaking can take us.Unfolds with such a wallop of you-are-there immediacy that when the bullets start to fly, your first instinct is to duck.",

        "document": "Biker Boyz leaves The Fast and the Furious eating its dust.\"Biker Boyz\" is not a pretty picture.As films go, it's as bad as an Elvis movie some of the time and better than an Elvis movie, but not by much, the rest of the time.An endurance-testing racing drama, Biker Boyz is wildly overdirected, and its slight story feels more padded than a rubber room.The jolting stunts and competitive races deliver all the excitement you'd want. You'll be disappointed only if you insist on a plot and complex characters.It's too long and self-consciously progressive to be entertaining, but it's too well-intentioned to be dismissed altogether.Biker Boyz is the kind of movie Howard Hawks would have made if he'd lived long enough to feel the heat of hip-hop's impact on the culture at large.A dreary, overlong, unfocused bore that tries to make up in restless, hand-held camera work for what it lacks in drama, humor or any semblance of psychological truth.It isn't good, certainly, but despite its numerous faults, it's a surprisingly entertaining mishmash of genres and cliches.Though the bikes are fast, the drama idles, with corny characters taking themselves more seriously than heads of state negotiating arms treaties.There are a couple of really flashy stunt scenes but there aren't enough of them to carry the flick, forcing moviegoers to focus on the lame story and its sad sack of disconnected characters.Cheesy RiderEven if you don't know much about motorcycles going in, by the end of Biker Boyz, the words 'manifold exhaust' may suddenly seem clear to you.There's a good story in here somewhere, but it's been dumbed down for Biker Boyz.The only enjoyment you'll get is laughing at the dopey slang and the cast's ridiculously macho glares and stares.More 'the mild one' than 'The Wild One.'In some ways, watching Biker Boyz is like watching two hours of chest-bumping.The characters are largely uninteresting, the movie has little panache and the motorcycle races blend one into another.Biker Boyz has an idea, but not an approach.It's a mild one among biker pics, a tricycle only pretending to be a Hog.People will complain about Biker Boyz, but I defy anyone to make a better movie about motorcycle racing clubs.Meagan Good is a good thing...Biker Boyz ain't so good.Alas, the movie takes itself too seriously, too often and is ultimately unsure if it wants to be a bike flick, a hackneyed father-son drama or an expose on Black biker culture. In the end it doesn't achieve any of the goals successfully.Unimpressive, often bothersome, action photography and a surface soapy story line.Timid about pushing the action pic envelope and an uncertain of tone, Biker Boyz never really busts out of second gear.With some okay racing footage but a dramatic story that becomes so leaden that it drags down the entire production, Biker Boyz doesn't get the viewer's engine racing as fast or as hard as it should.Biker Boyz is like a mega-powered motorcycle with nowhere to go.Shot and edited in typical rapid-fire MTV style, Biker Boyz is both arresting and dizzying to sit through.Biker Boyz is about fast motorcycles and the tough dudes -- and even tougher chicks -- who soup them up in illegal street races. Unfortunately, it's about more than that.A turgid actioner which sticks a fine cast atop a series of tricked-out motorcycles and sends them speeding down the expressway to mediocrity.Like most of the Westerns it was patterned after, Boyz is disposable entertainment.Biker Boyz boasts a few show-off-y camera moves and a whole lot of desperately stale dialogue.Halfway in comes a plot development so ludicrous it saps any feeling of charity toward Biker Boyz.Basically a slow, lazy soap opera that just happens to be set in the world of California bike gangs...the intimate scenes plod mercilessly, shapeless and distended.The plot tries to be epic and primal, but it is just derivitive and creaky. What works, though is the vibrant presence of some of today's most arresting actors.Biker Boyz bored me nearly to tears. It is the kind of vacuous, brain-dead movie that moves at an interminable pace....for all the testosterone-driven soap opera, this entertainingly confused coming-of-age story is a seductive fantasy...With its choppy pacing and tentative acting, the movie often feels like a montage of film clips hastily pasted together to tell a story.Cinematic idiocy served up by the troughful.For a movie about speed, Biker Boys spends too much time spinning its wheels.A dull soap with a baffling paucity of thrills.Despite the impressive cast and surplus of extraordinary vehicles, the film loses air after the first half, and rookie director Reggie Rock Bythewood can't seem to escape from a music-video mentality.Biker Boyz spins its wheels, makes with the smoke and the noise, but never really gets very far - and for a movie about motorcycle racing, that's like coming in last place.Essentially, Biker Boyz is a soap opera wrapped up in the trashy-but-flashy packaging of The Fast and the Furious.Unless you're willing to wade through a ton of offal to see some cool bikes, you're better off at the Honda showroom.A surprisingly ambivalent entry in genre that's usually brain-dead.... Director Reggie Rock Bythewood assures us of two things beyond all doubt: motorcycles are really loud and really fast.Watchable cheese.At times entertaining, but never boring. It sure could have been a lot worse.Think MTV does biker movie with great cast.For what it is, Biker Boyz is a satisfying ride. But that satisfaction is empty calorie entertainment.Would be better titled The Slow and the Sleepy for all the excitement it generates.A blatant re-spin of The Fast and the Furious that also happens to be a far better movie.Adrenaline-enriched junk food for the soul....though the filmmakers have installed an Oedipal melodrama beneath vibrating vroom and hip-hop score, all the film really accomplishes is making the alleged motorcycle racing subculture look nerdy and pretentious.The studio is touting the film as a \"contemporary Western\" but a \"two-hour hip-hop video with stank soap opera plot\" is more like it.Ultimately, the picture isn't especially fast or furious, just fleeting.In the end the exposition outweighs the thrills.At times it feels as though there are more subplots and one-shot minor characters in the mix than bikes on the screen.Isn't really good enough to hold your attention but at least doesn't abuse it too badly in the fleeting moments that it does.After Dancing in September, his droll examination of race and representation in Hollywood, Bythewood now hawks contrived escapism in lieu of provoking thought.It'll leave you with a monster-rally headache and a craving for something salty.A somewhat flat clone of Furious -- not the greatest source with which to base material on in the first place.Guy flicks can be just as galling as the chick variety....not worth getting revved up over.Not without moments of excitement, romance and rubber-burning redemption.The races take a back seat to endless soul-searching, accusations, half-hearted reconciliations and feeble love scenes.Director Bythewood is a competent visual stylist, capturing the adrenaline and testosterone of these macho rituals. That doesn't make up for the predictability of the script.Still, this frenzied concoction of Yo! MTV Raps meets The Fast and the Furious in the mean streets of discontentment plays like a misguided melodrama running on an empty gas tank of worthy ideas.Biker Boyz, in a word, stinkz.The final race was so anticlimactic that I wish I had left the theater and just imagined a better ending.The film is the product of juvenile filmmaking, from the ham-fisted acting to the boring staging of most of the action sequences.When the filmmakers aren't busy accommodating cameo models and comedians, they seem to be dozing off at the handlebars.Biker Boyz is just a silly film.Is so muddled in melodramatic theatrics that it dulls down the action setpieces, while the action setpieces are so subdued on their own that the melodrama is just the final nail in the coffin of a movie with little to redeem it.Honestly, I would gladly have given this film 2 1/2 stars if I could've had fewer tears and more crazy motorcycle stunts and crashes.As street-racing pictures go, Biker Boyz doesn't do anything unexpected. But because it takes its characters seriously and slows down enough for us to get to know them.We sense that we're gonna have a funky good time, or at least a campy one, and Biker Boyz does not disappoint. Much.The training-wheels version of The Fast And The Furious.A laughable piece of posturing that makes `The Fast and the Furious' look like a model of restraint.Has the stink of man-musk all over it.Fishburne and Luke do their best with inherently limited material, but only Calloway's no-nonsense single mother really rises above the roar of engines and the smell of burning rubber.It takes some work to make 100-mph motorcycle races boring, but they've managed to pull it off here.The perfect testosterone-fueled, flash-edited, music-driven joy ride.More entertaining than you might expect.Biker Boyz had the potential to be a good movie -- if it had gone in one of two directions.",

        "document": "A talky bore that reduces the original film's pontificating -- about the nature of 'reality' -- to windy, fortune-cookie philosophizing.Both more literal and less lyrical than Abre Los Ojos.When [Cruise is] the boss on a project, as he was here and on Mission Impossible II, his work can feel distractingly self-conscious.There is wonderful chemistry of two quite different kinds between Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz on the one hand, and Cruise and Penelope Cruz on the other.Every bit as strange and creepily effective as the original.Inevitably, the film seems as hollow and pointless as David is.The film, whether they like it or not, is about being beautiful and then losing it. Hollywood's penultimate nightmare.Crowe does a good job of keeping Sky's outer-limits story planted on Earth.It's perhaps ironic that a film about love, truth and reality would be so devoid of true emotion, especially considering the filmmaker behind the camera.Neither simple enough for sheer popcorn-thriller fun nor complex enough for true psychodrama buffs.Successfully lures the viewer to feel sympathy for the the protagonist.I have no idea why one of our most original film-makers would want to spend two years of his life translating someone else's movie from Spanish into English. And it wasn't such a good film in Spanish, either.The continued presence of Jung's MEMORIES, DREAMS, REFLECTIONS on the table as the movie unfolds via flashback...is the key to unlocking...Vanilla SkyIf Crowe's eyes are open, he seems to have directed most of Vanilla Sky with his mind wide shut.The film is a scene-by-scene remake of the not-so-hot 1997 Spanish film, Abre los Ojos (Open your Eyes).Crowe [is] ill-equipped to handle the subtle and not-so-subtle tonal shifts of a mind-bending romantic thriller[A] spectacular film!Will leave audiences groaning as if they had just been told the lamest joke on earth.The real mixes with the surreal to form the sludgy slur-real which blends into a blur-real.Surreal, mysterious, engaging, clever and most of all, entertaining.People who haven't seen Ojos may still dig the twist and turns in Sky, but even they'll likely be unimpressed with the ending.It is good to see Cruise and Crowe doing something a little left of center here.In many ways, the story is pure Twilight Zone, but Crowe's down-to-earth approach softens and grounds it, making the characters seem more genuine, even amidst the surreal setting.I don't think I've ever seen a movie so hauntingly frank about being a manifestation of its star's cosmic narcissism.As pretentious as it is preposterous, Vanilla Sky needs its own wake-up call.A masturbatory pop culture thriller that only services Cameron Crowe's fondness for rock n' roll.A combination of various successful players/styles has resulted in a nice looking art house-look big budget mess.Convoluted and by turns mind-bendingly playful and annoying, Crowe's psychodrama is full of good intentions.When it comes to adult drama, it seems Hollywood is still out of touch with the real world.Imitation can indeed be the sincerest form of flattery by being so bad in comparison.This romantic psychological/sci-fi thriller is pretty to look at but basically empty inside.Sort of like a second-rate Mulholland Drive, but that would be giving it too much credit.The important question isn't \"What's going on?\" but \"Why should we care?\" Vanilla Sky, unfortunately, can't come up with an answer.One of the most captivating failures of the year.A good example of what self-destructive cinematic havoc can be wrought by handing over millions of dollars to movie stars to produce their own ego trips.Vanilla Sky has a lot going for it, and at times it seems to be working beautifully.A tremendously vivid work which rewards patience and attention with a wonderful and exhilarating resonance.Vanilla Sky is an enjoyable experience whether or not you have seen the original.Crowe le da sentido humano a una historia en la que los sue\u0144os son mucho mejores que la realidad.Bad enough the butler actually did it - have the butler wipe the victim's blood on the stumped inspector's face, & confess for 10 minutes..Walks that fine line between disturbing and strange, but with its pandering, it doesn't actually achieve either.Vanilla Sky's forecast is not looking very sunny at this point in Cameron Crowe's murky psychosexual dramaInstead of a formula we get a story that keeps unfolding, and instead of chatter that drives the plot forward we have dialogue referring to things important to the characters.An alienating portrait of alienation, a study of hollow lifestyles and phoney dreams that sometimes feels hollow and phoney itself.Vanilla Sky proves to be Cameron Crowe's wildest work to date. It's also his least coherent, but for some viewers that may be a plus.The less I understood it, the more I couldn't stop watching it.It wants to be weird, but it's terrified of being too bizarre.One big mushy mess of a movie.Crowe should not be wasting his time remaking someone else's perfectly good picture.At its core, an involving, sweetly touching love story, buoyed by Crowe's natural, poetic dialogue and his knack for writing characters (especially women) who feel like real people instead of plot devices.You're usually too busy reacting to the plot jackknifes and trying to get a handle on the characters to connect on an emotional level.There's plenty of fluff and puff (and a soundtrack that's way overused) -- but little pay off.Crowe's tantalizing film sticks with you.Fails to capitalize on its riveting concept and across-the-board phenomenal performances.Crowe's noodling doesn't completely ruin the setup, one wonders if Cruise's fondness for the first movie might have been better spent sponsoring a quality English dub.They just should've added some chunks of chocolate chip cookie dough to give the movie some texture and edge.There is a certain fascination involved when A-listers go this wrong on a picture, and as a result, the movie becomes a perverse thrill[Vanilla Sky] results...[in] a bittersweet outside with a soft and caramel center.This jumbled mess drove me to therapy.It makes you wonder where 'a cover' ends and karaoke begins.The basic problem of \"Vanilla\" is not its adherence to the earlier movie, however. It's the stifling air of emotional detachment that hangs over the entire film; next to this, Cruise's similar \"Eyes Wide Shut\" looks downright heartwarming.V\u00e1 at\u00e9 a locadora e procure pela vers\u0103o dirigida por Alejandro Amen\u00e1bar. Voc\u0119 gastar\u00e1 menos dinheiro e certamente ficar\u00e1 mais satisfeito.One of the year's best...after the second or third viewing.Vanilla Sky no es un remake tibio; es una cinta que se nos encaja en los ojos y se nos adentra, rasc\u00e1ndonos en lo m\u00e1s profundo de nuestro intelecto.A riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma. The problem is, the mystery and the enigma are in one movie, and the riddle\u2019s in an entirely different movie.Crowe hasn't exactly ruined what the original [Abre los Ojos] has offered...even if he's reduced its sense of pathos. The bottom line is that Vanilla Sky still offers more than the average Hollywood film.Stands as a genuine existential idyll, a movie that muses rather than demanding, 'Solve me.'Perversely rewarding, difficult, even torturous, but beautifully made and distinctly nagging.Vanilla Sky offered Crowe a chance to prove himself as an artist, but all it does is show once again that he is an able draftsman.An overlong, overblown misfire that expends a capable cast, an occasionally brilliant director and some first-tier filmmaking techniques on schizophrenic, ill-considered folderol.Terminally silly and pretentious.The relatively few American viewers who saw the Spanish film will find Crowe's version more artful and better explained than its predecessor.The film's aim -- to dazzle and inspire -- is sapped by Cruise's vein-popping, running-the-marathon performance.A facile, sentimental mess.A flawed film, but at times utterly engrossing.A decent film that isn't as good, thrilling or haunting as the original, but should still mesmerize viewers unfamiliar with Amen\u00e1bar's version.An engrossing and tempestous journey into the abyss of the mind.Its biggest misstep is the talky, explanatory conclusion, which leaves attentive viewers with little to chew on.An interesting failure... in a perverse way, while Vanilla Sky certainly doesn't stand up to Crowe's still-fresh masterwork Almost Famous, it does confirm his directorial prowess.For all its shortcomings, Vanilla Sky exerts a hypnotic, otherwordly attraction....not the typical flashy blockbuster Tom Cruise fans may have come to expect.The ending is anti-climactic not only because the explanation leaves no stone unturned but also because the explanation itself is unsatisfactory.It's intricate, true, yet surprisingly easy to follow.Maybe something this surreal needs unknowns to keep it in the ether.As the story gets darker and heavier, the film really grabs hold in a powerful way, as long as we can let ourselves be carried along until the complex conclusion.A mature, intelligent thriller that bends the audience's perceptions and expectations with every scene.A ravishing stunner that never loses its way once...Director[Cameron Crowe's] most stunning work to date.A brazenly challenging and richly rewarding fable about actions and consequences, dreams and realities.Even Crowe's uncanny ability to pick the perfect pop song abandons him.It's really just a lot of whacked-out psychological mumbo-jumbo.In the end, this hard-to-classify film ... is little more than a cheap parlor trick.In an era when filmmakers invariably play it safe, there's something quite wonderful about a big star throwing all caution to the winds and, yes, reaching for the sky.A case of the vain leading the bland.For all the filmmakers' efforts, this project is something of an artistic albatross.It's not really a bad film -- it couldn't be, given the high level of talent involved -- but it is a rather pointless one.What works in a quirky foreign film can look silly with expansive Hollywood treatment.What carries the movie is Mr. Cruise's impeccable marathon-man star turn.Crowe's version lacks the qualities that made Abre Los Ojos unforgettable and doesn't add enough of its own to ensure success.Feels enervated and logy, its energy sucked into the vacuum of Tom Cruise's star power.Imagine if someone remade The Others...with Casper the Friendly Ghost. That should give you a pretty good idea what Cameron Crowe has done with Vanilla Sky.An over-hyped, confusing film.The crown prince of weakling uplift has actually fallen down on the altar of the ultimate Kafkaesque Hollywood godhead: Tom CruiseYou mightn't see its like from mainstream Hollywood for some time....A seriously weird and intriguing psychological drama.Crowe had a huge budget, and he uses it gloriously.These Skies are not only Vanilla, but a bit too familiar . . . Tom Cruise once again plays himself playing a characterThe film is seamless, surprising and erotic, mixing the best elements of romance, sci fi and drama.... A psychological thriller that will keep you guessing even after you've left the theater.Vanilla Sky is a long, complex, ambitious thriller that doesn't quite work.Expect top notch work by Cruise, Crowe and Co.Perhaps the greatest mystery in Cruise-Crowe mindbender is why it doesn't quite work.A great cast, a decent soundtrack and some memorable scenes make it ultimately worth watching. (But see the original if at all humanly possible.)None of it makes much sense.A misbegotten venture that transforms a flawed but intriguing original into an elephantine, pretentious mess....All that's left is the murkiness and obscurity.Insists on spelling things out, and the more we know about the supernatural direction the movie takes, the less interesting it is.not a 'normal Tom pic.'The director and his leading man vest David with just enough endearing humanity to suck us in to his tale.It's visual, it's bombastic, it tells a story that almost makes sense, and you can't get it out of your head.Bland and lacking flavor.A complex film that is actually better than the original it was based on.I'm afraid that David just isn't that interesting.Imagine watching Tootsie for 100 minutes and then finding out that Dustin Hoffman was really an alienVanilla Sky turns out to be a rousing, exhilarating entertainment, thanks mostly to Cruise's balls-to-the-wall performance.My suggestion is to avoid this film and instead rent Open Your Eyes (Abre Los Ojos) the film upon which Vanilla Sky was based.Two and a half hours I'll never get back...It just makes things easier to believe that good-looking rich folks are just as miserable and unhappy as the rest of us . . .This is a whole new palette for Crowe, and his excitement rubs off on us.A classic case of what happens when a Hollywood studio and a star (Cruise) take a Spanish metaphysical thriller and turn it into a glossy, overproduced big-budget star vehicle that lacks distinct identity.This isn't a typically dumbed-down rehash and, as such, it dissatisfied the rank and file of multiplex moviegoers but earned the appreciation of adventurous film fans.Crowe asks the viewer to absorb this more viscerally than intellectually; how much one enjoys (or even accepts) the experience will likely depend on the extent to which one is willing to do so.Some surface appeal, but ultimately vacant.Writer/director Crowe's screenplay is quite faithful to the original story, but he makes a confusing story even more so.The Spanish feature was difficult and challenging. The American re-creation is difficult and frustrating.I barely bought a word of it as it was.Cameron Crowe's vinyl-collector version of \"Jacob's Ladder\" is a daring gamble paying off even when ambition exceeds his grasp. The subconscious can boil over with too much pop culture poured in. Keep that in mind, and it will have you at \"What the hell?\"Hollywood films as gutsy as this one shouldn't cop out and try to explain everything away just because it's complicated.A jumble of spiritual and musical references that is either self-indulgent or daring, but a little creepy in both cases.The end isn't satisfying enough to justify their efforts and your time.[Crowe] should stick to more conventional narratives and leave the cerebral gymnastics to someone who can handle them.Why does it seem like the kind of misfire only Hollywood can produce?A film that, despite intriguing ideas, cleverly tricky structure and some remarkable imagery, just doesn't work.A hopeless jumble of romance, psychodrama, sci-fi and spiritual posturing.[Crowe's] 'bigger is better' approach consistently misplaces the emphasis and waters down the movie's appeal.When you learn the solution, hinted at vaguely with a few early clues, you're likely to be surprised. Satisfied, though, is another matter.Much of it is existential mumbo jumbo.If you don't mind a film that challenges you to think and to re-evaluate your perceptions, you might just like it.Someone should buy Crowe a pair of scissors. I'd love to see a much shorter director's cut.Vanilla Sky resembles a fast-and-flashy variation on The Sixth Sense, with touches of The Matrix as a bonus.Consider this as though it were the Hollywood version of an intriguing morality play.It's both fascinating and frustrating.Who would have thought that Cameron Crowe had a movie as bad as Vanilla Sky in him?This movie has a lot of surface appeal, but at its core it is as vacant as the story's main character.Cameron Crowe's remake is glossier, warmer and star-powered, although his ending... is muddled.Like the ultimate party-pooper, it's unwilling to leave questions unanswered, and apparently unable to let us figure things out for ourselves.A film that you can take home and chew over later, both abrasive in its loudness and reflective in its fleeting, feminine moments of silence.A visually dazzling but ultimately dizzying ride, a trippy suspenser that gets tripped up on its own deja vu voodoo.",

        "document": "Instead of attempting a journalistic study of bus-travel, regularly punctuated by comic touches, Director Frank Capra and Robert Riskin who adapted Samuel Hopkins Adams' story, fused the two.An old school classic.As classy and charming a romantic comedy as you're ever likely to see...Both stars loathed the experience yet turned in two of their most enduring performances.A screwball comedy with charm and sass it established a template that countless films have followed down the decades.It Happened One Night is pure delight.Among the more gratifying phenomena of the current season has been the growing recognition of It Happened One Night, the Frank Capra production of last year, as one of the few potential classics of the recent cinema.Still one of the best screwball comedies.It Happened One Night is a good piece of fiction, which, with all its feverish stunts, is blessed with bright dialogue and a good quota of relatively restrained scenes.It Happened One Night (1934) is one of the greatest romantic comedies in film history, and a film that has endured in popularity. It is considered one of the pioneeringThis classic comedy is the first movie ever to sweep the five major Oscar categories.With Gable and Colbert on top form this is a charming and memorable comedy.One of those stories that without a particularly strong plot manages to come through in a big way, due to the acting, dialog, situations and direction.Still as good as everyone says it is.It dates badly, but there's enough here to make it worthwhile... stands as a significant landmark in cinema history, giving birth for more romantic comedies to come...one of the smartest romantic comedies of the season. The Capra technique is evident in this story of a rich man's daughter who rebels at her father's objection to her marriage to an aviator.Uma p\u00e9rola de bom humor e otimismo.The grandparent of the screwball comedy sub-genre, and arguably Frank Capra's best film.The ultimate dizzy, romantic, screwball comedy.It happened one night in 1934, and it happens every time we watch this utterly beguiling film.Its opposites-attract melding of screwball comedy and the road trip elements has become one of about a half-dozen standard love story formulas. Most years, there's at least one theatrical release that owes a debt to this film.Only minorly dated, this film would play well for modern audiences despite being more than 70 years old.This is Capra at his best, very funny and very light, with a minimum of populist posturing.This charming romantic comedy, while grounded in the context of the Depression, offered light fare that's uncharacteristic of Capra. It might have been the first true sleeper since no one involved anticipated such critical and commercial success.The story of a runaway heiress falling in with a devilish, wise-cracking reporter on a cross-country roadtrip now seems like a clich\u00e9 only because so many other films have copied its structure.The romantic comedy that all others draw from, few imitate effectively, and none have been able to replicate.It Happened One Night is a true classic in every sense of the word, one that withstands the test of time and indeed defies it completely.Who can resist a movie where the girl's father provides his daughter with a getaway car from her own wedding?Capra's sense of humour is a little like that of Preston Sturges, though less caustic; and the film shows its stars at their best, Colbert as one of Hollywood's fresher comediennes, Gable as dumb-but-loveable hunk.Not only will the Walls of Jericho fall, but so will the walls of your heart.A very funny and breezy comedy.It's funny, beautifully directed and acted and it's always been one of my favourites.As buoyant and elegant as bubbles in a glass of champagne, Frank Capra's sublime 1934 comedy... survives triumphantly because of its wit, charm, romantic idealism and its shrewd sketch of married life.Viewed even today with all of its plot elements recycled ad nauseam by Hollywood (for rom-coms, road trip comedies, odd couple/buddy films, etc.), the film still holds up because we believe Gable and Colbert and can identify with them both right away.It's nearly impossible to find anyone who doesn't love it. Or doesn't feel, in some way, that it speaks to them.One of the most enduring romantic comedies of Hollywood's golden age\u0085 The opposites-attract comedy still works, though Gable\u2019s dismissive treatment of pampered Colbert, which played well with Depression-era audiences, seems dated today.It Happened One Night is one of the easiest movies to love and one of the hardest to think of as a work of art.Frank Capra's It Happened One Night was a film that defied expectations to such an outrageous extent that the cinema has never fully recovered from its impact or influence.It's probably more historically important than it is a masterpiece (the last 20 minutes take the missed conections and misunderstandings an inch too far), but it's still very easy to fall in love with.The direction is excellent. Frank Capra never lets his picture lag for a moment. It is never very exciting, but it moves along snappily and it is full of amusing situations.Perhaps not the greatest of the screwball comedies, but Frank Capra's It Happened One Night is one of the racier.It Happened One Night was in many ways a predecessor to the modern romantic comedy, and its dynamics will still feel familiar to the current-day viewer.",

        "document": "settle down for something wondrous, and wondrously artificial - an hour and a half of proof that the Dream Factory can still squeeze out more than one happy song to sing along.The sunniest, happiest film in the world - and if the under-10 in your life can't appreciate that, it might be time to put them up for adoption.It's never cloying or too knowing. Cynicism and wariness are real world concerns that have no place among the foam and felt.So genial, so joyous, and suffused with such a lip-smacking sweetness, that the occasional pacing issues and subplot hiccups simply don't seem to matter.The most sensational, inspirational, celebrational, Muppetational comeback fans could have hoped for.Witty, affectionate and charmingly silly.Made absolutely for grown-up fans, this is the Muppets as you fondly remember them: funny, smart and gleefully insane.A film bursting at the seams with sheer, unadulterated joy: watch it, and the world seems just that little bit brighter...invites viewers to become a bit like the dreamer Walter and, in (re)discovering and embracing their inner child (not to mention their inner muppet), to join a fantastic, funny family that never grows old, no matter how times may have changed.Brushing aside decades of nostalgia, this is a whip-smart postmodern romp with a warm heart to boot, and as such, it should please both life-long fans and new initiates to the Muppet universe.These are the same old, adorable Muppets, as sweetly innocent and likable as ever. Winking at itself, the movie is casually, amusingly self-reflexive.A mixed bag then: The Muppets isn't the best or the worst of Kermit's big-screen capers. At least it's a reminder that here's one frog who isn't about to croak.The Muppets is a triumph of simplicity, innocence and goofy jokes. It's a triumph of felt.A heap o' feel-good, wholesome, splashy fun.Capturing the flavor of the old television series while featuring guest stars more popular with today's younger generation, \"The Muppets\" is a fun ride down the nostalgia highway.I found \"The Muppets\" movie to be highly tolerable, and agreeably low on the Miss Piggy involvement scale.snarky-smartThe innocence is slightly twisted, the harmonious camaraderie is slightly corrosive and the characters are slightly eccentricI smiled throughout this madcap joyous adventure in which the Muppets are funny, silly, colourful and totally endearing in what must be the happiest film of the New YearMY inner child - the one who loved The Muppet Show, The Muppet Movie and The Great Muppet Caper - really wants to give this film five stars.By focusing on the Muppets of The Muppet Show (1976-1981) rather than the independent Muppets of prior films, the writers open up an unexplored aspect of Muppet lore ripe for revival.Everybody loves the Muppets and this happy mix of live-action and puppet chaos is perfect entertainment for every age.A nice throwback to the good old days of the Muppets.Under James Bobin's direction, however, the outing feels cheap and strangely small-screen.An altogether charming, smart and strangely moving little movie.The Muppets may be one of the best films of the year, not judged as a children's film, or a family film, but instead, simply as a film.The Muppets is really two movies. And one of those movies is quite good, albeit awfully similar to previous films.Muppet comedy offers memorable laughs, musical numbers.I've never seen a movie so perfectly balanced between unabashed nerdiness and hipness. It's transcendent that way.Oh, how we needed this...Nothing here will surprise you -- which is, really, as it should be. Segel, serving as co-writer, and director James Bobin have, with a knowing wink, mined the old-time Muppet charm and humor, and they have hit paydirt.The film is loaded with everything Muppets fans love: loopy musical production numbers, very funny montages, some hilarious asides and weird little moments.The writing is clever, with giddy self-reference, time-honored tropes, and a bevy of dancing chickens who beat out a completely credible tattooIt's funny, moving, quick-witted, and way better than anything your kids are watching on TV these days....more generically happy than edgy or witty.God love the movie that flips a giant bird in the face of cynicism.The Muppets are evergreen; it just took an effort like this to remind us of the fact.The best of their big-screen adventures since the original and the first Muppet-related endeavor since Heson's passing that truly understands what it is that made them so special and memorable in the first place.\"The Muppets\" made me feel warm and Fozzie.Utterly true to the spirit of the original television series and pure delight for both fans and newcomers.Kids today will have the same kind of fun at The Muppets they have at all films of this kind. Adults, however, will connect in a deeper way.The Muppet relaunch is as it should be: the most sensational, inspirational, celebrational treat you could wish for on a holiday weekend.The Muppets treats its titular heroes with affection and respect, even as Fozzie Bear shows off his \"fart shoes\" and toilet humor abounds.The Muppet franchise is revitalized with \"The Muppets,\" a funny, wickedly self-aware musical that opens by acknowledging they've outlived their shelf life.It's not easy bein' clean in pop culture when a phony TV reality show called Punch Teacher isn't impossible to believe... The world today is no place for The Muppets, which is exactly why we need them.Rather than returning like a lot of other beloved children's franchises, spiffed up in CGI and hipster attitudes, the Muppets are stubbornly old-school and delightfully schmaltzy.Except for a few good zingers from balcony dwellers Statler and Waldorf, there isn't much here for mom and dad.\"The Muppets\" is both a delightful family film about the Muppets and a winking, self-referential satire about how lame the Muppets are.During the movie's best moments, I recalled exactly what my long-gone father's roars of laughter sounded like.The Muppets is a celebration of all things Muppets -- filled with fun, laughter and moments of pure joy.A good imitation of the Muppet style.I am a fan of The Muppets and I'm glad to see them making a comeback. Maybe if this movie is a hit, they'll make a sequel where they'll actually get to be the stars of their own film.Even balcony critics Waldorf and Statler would have a hard time faulting this Wonkaful delight.The Muppets is a joyful mix of the nostalgic past and a vibrant present. It tops the list of family movies for the holidays. The movie asks the question, \"Do you have what it takes to be one of the Muppets?\" Of course, we do.The film's success is owed to the fact that the living, breathing actors understand the show belongs to the Muppets. In their capable paws, claws, and flippers, the fun, kindness, and total, unadulterated wackiness of The Muppet Show is finally back.It may not entirely work as a movie, but The Muppets shines as a piece of touching pop nostalgia.The Muppets heralds the return of Jim Henson's beloved furry creations, resurrected from pop-culture irrelevance and lovingly restored to their former greatness in a vibrant comedy-musical.A return to form for Kermit and company.The new muppet movie, written by Jason Segel and Nicholas Stoller, is a total delight. Any fears that the muppets may have been unwisely thrust into something that is outside of their inherent character can be safely allayed.The film offers up plenty of old-fashioned entertainment and nostalgia to please kids and their parents.(Parental Movie Review also available)So much love pumped into this movie, it's difficult to quibble with the funereal tone of the first half, or the lack of noteworthy tunes...a picture so fixated on resuscitating The Muppets it practically bleeds felt.Its story about not fitting in and finding your place in the world will appeal to anyone who is, was or has a child. Did I leave anyone out?Desperately trying to appeal to not just the Gen Xers who grew up with Kermit, Miss Piggy, and Dr. Teeth, but also the tykes who've never even heard of Jim Henson, The Muppets has none of the easy confidence of the original TV show or the 1979 movie.This is clearly a labor of love for star/writer Segel and the entire cast is having a blast with it.Don't call it a comeback. The Muppets never went away.I freely admit that I brought plenty of Muppet adoration with me into the theater. I was overjoyed when the movie earned it anyway.The Muppets proves that, while it might be impossible to recapture magic, the right people ... re-implementing a workable formula can still result in ample rewards.Watching The Muppets is like getting a big, warm hug from friends who've been away far too long.Less irreverent than it should be and, during the home stretch, not as spirited and momentous as one hopes. Reacquainting audiences to the charms of hand puppets, however, is a victory in and of itself.[It] has plenty of affection for the beloved title characters, and its winking humor frequently hits the mark.The Muppet legacy is in no way sullied, but the over-the-moon magic is missing. They should try Hare Krishna.With its goofy humor and rousing put-on-a-show spirit, The Muppets will win over \"the lovers, the dreamers\" and, yes, you.Segel and his team are not Jim Henson -- but they've done justice to the lovers and the dreamers.The movie is better when the muppets are front and center and not the humansActor-writer Jason Segel happily plays a supporting role and lets a new generation be introduced to Kermit, Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear, Gonzo, and Animal.Is it perfect? No. Is it a lot of fun and does it successfully revive this inspired franchise? Absolutely and let's seriously hope so. A world without Kermit is just too hard to face.Writer/actor Jason Segel and his co-writer honor Jim Henson and his crew's sense of humor and perfectly capture flavor of the legendary TV and movie series.\"The Muppets\" is a movie that will transport some adults back to their childhoods as well as entertain youngsters with its charm and humor.Overall I found the movie a bit too cloying and self-aware to distinguish itself from the mass of kiddie flick pap.Both an awesome Muppet outing and an epically entertaining comedy, period.Growing up, I loved the Muppets. This film is a great chance for a new generation to fall for them as well.Like Statler and Waldorf, older viewers may kvetch and cavil about the details, but when that red velvet curtain goes up, we wouldn't give up our balcony seats for the world.The Muppet charm, always more at home within the intimate frame of a TV set, is gone here.Jubilantly renews the signature mix of craziness, cleverness and camp that made the Muppets multimedia superstars in a previous entertainment era.No fourth wall is safe in The Muppets, and that's a great piece of news.Wonderful! Delightful! Utterly charming!It is a film that works for...fans who remember what the Muppets were but it's also a great way of establishing who the Muppets are.It's nice to see the band back together. And when Kermit busts out the banjo for \"Rainbow Connection,\" you might even go for your lighter.The Muppets is a perfectly fine picture. That may sound like damning the movie with faint praise, but considering the state of the franchise in recent years, \"perfectly fine\" is almost the equivalent of a solid A.\"The Muppets\" is clever and current without being cynical, smart without being condescending, funny without being exclusionary to grown-ups or to kids.Longtime Muppet fans will undoubtedly have more fun than young ones, but for the most part, it's a witty, delightful romp.Admittedly, there are a few misfires every once in a while, but with its barrage of self-referential humor, breaking through the fourth wall jokes, imaginative cameos and satirical winks at Hollywood conventions, The Muppets is a comedy lover's dream.Not all nostalgia is created equal.... older folks raised on the late Jim Henson's brainchildren will be charmed ...There's still an endearing sweetness that permeates The Muppets.One of the movie's real pleasures is the 'reality' of its puppety ethos -- our awareness that Segel and Adams really are talking to Kermit and Piggy, and not to a blank space that will be filled in later by an animator....the film stands as an appropriate comeback for (and introduction to) Jim Henson's iconic creation.The Muppets marks a triumphant return for these beloved characters. This movie made me feel good all over.The love Segel has for the Muppets is a genuine, perceivable and positive quality that suffuses this good-hearted revitalization of the franchise, and if some wish fulfillment sneaks in there too, it seldom gets in the way of the enjoyment to be had.They're still all great fun (even if, with Jim Henson gone and Frank Oz not participating, not everyone sounds quite as they did at the beginning).All of our old favorites are here, from Fozzie Bear and Miss Piggy to the original grumpy old men, Statler and Waldorf, along with a number of celebrities in amusing cameos...The Muppets don't rap or bust hip-hop moves. That in itself is almost revolutionary nowadays, when adorable family-franchise characters spitting bars seems practically de rigueur.You can tell that these filmmakers grew up cherishing what was best about the Muppets. ... From the script to the colors to the body language, it all has Henson's heartbeat.Marvellous. The Muppets manages to revitalise the family classic to create a hilarious and life-affirming delight.It's fun to spend time with these characters again.The Muppets never went away, and \"The Muppets\" is a celebration of that. It's time to play the music, and it's time to light the lights.What is a Muppet? Is it something one is born? Is it something one chooses? Is it a state of mind? Is it a lifestyle?Serving as both a wondrous stroll down your childhood and a fantastic introduction to Kermit and company, this is a warmly inspired nostalgia kick that will delight both longtime fans and endear the franchise to a new generation.It's good to have them back. Manah, Manah.A luminous and loving tribute to the man who breathed life into nothing but felt and faux fur.The muppets are back, just like we remember them, with catchy tunes and meta humor. Also, a great cast of cameo appearances is paired with a fun story and iconic characters that haven't been detrimentally modernized.A Muppet film that not only lives up to the franchise legacy and, for some, might just end up being one of their all-time favorite adventures with Kermit and the gang.The giddiness that Jim Henson & Friends brought to the original Muppets is missing. The antic energy, the old vaudeville/TV variety show references are just plain alien to modern kids.We defy anyone over the age of 30 not to get emotional when the lights do go up and Kermit takes the stage ...For the first several reels, The Muppets is nearly perfect with its winningly dopey musical numbers and joyful humor.One of the best movies you'll see this year.A mostly winning return for childhood favorites from a prior century looks to accomplish its goal of pleasing old fans and winning new ones.Dear Muppets: Thank goodness you're back. And thank goodness for the pens of Jason Segel and Nicholas Stoller, who wrote this brilliant screenplay to get you back on the big screen where you belong.Muppet News Flash! Your friends in felt are back on the big screen, ready and waiting to charm a new generation of...moppets.its mixture of nostalgia, postmodern humor, and all-around generosity may be exactly what is needed to endear the Muppets to a whole new generationA loving, faithful and very entertaining adaptation that gets what the Muppets are about and why people love them.[Filmmakers] hew close to the essential innocence informing the Muppets' silliness.The world has moved on and gotten harder and more cynical without The Muppets. Their return is cause for celebration, even if the Henson family and Frank Oz aren't involved.The minute the picture started, I heaved a sigh of relief and broke out in a smile. This is a joyful movie, the kind the Muppets (and their many fans) deserve.Here's a cruel suggestion: Leave the kids at home. After all, what grownup weaned on a steady diet of Muppets wants to interrupt a jaunt down memory lane by having to escort weak bladders to the bathroom or hungry mouths to the concession stand?...colorful, musical, and fun. Just OK for adults but children should love it.A new wave of Muppet-mania is unlikely, but it's fun to see the fuzzy gang again.Segel not only does the legacy of Henson's creation proud with The Muppets, he's delivered one of the best family films of the last decade and arguably the funniest film of 2011.Kids will like the simplicity of the story, the slapstick and the cute puppets. But adults will be taken back to their childhood days with the presentation and in-jokes.The purity of the nostalgia turns this franchise film into a love letter to childhood.A bit flat and never quite as madcap or wacky as the TV show or early films, The Muppets hits enough right notes to be a pleasing welcome back for longtime fans and a lovely introduction for those deprived of Muppets magic.The beloved gang's sweet reunion will melt nostalgic adults into laughter and tears, and maybe kids won't mind drippy new Muppet Walter so much.Enough to make you go Manha-Manha! remember that feeling you got in the cinema watching \"The Muppet Movie\" as a tyke? You'll feel it all again.It's time to start the music. The Muppets have gotten a brilliant makeover. The holiday season just got a whole lot brighter.Segel would seem an unlikely choice to spark a revival of the lovable foam-and-felt puppets, but here they are - as funny, outlandish and sweet as ever.If you similarly find yourself fighting back tears of joy - even during a sequence in which chickens cluck along to a sanitised (muppetised?) version of Cee-Lo's F*ck You - know that you are far from alone. The Muppets makes superfans out of all of us.'The Muppets' is not just one of the best films of the year, it is an affirmation that we can indeed occasionally find our way home again, and that some things shouldn't change.Shrewdly conceived, this franchise rebook aims to please adult viewers who remember the TV show, as well as their children, exposed for the first time to the magic of the cultural phenomenon.\"The Muppets'' marks a very welcome return for Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy and the rest of Jim Henson's creations after a 12-year big-screen absence.Effortlessly blending wised-up, self-reflexive humor with old-fashioned let's-put-on-a-show pizzazz, The Muppets is an unexpected treatThe Muppets is an infectiously happy tribute to and rejuvenation of Jim Henson's signature creation, given new life by Jason Segal....one of the most awesomely entertaining movies of the year!...a hilarious, clever, original, and absolutely joyful movie that manages to reboot the franchise without losing what made it a special in the first place.Sweet and silly, this nostalgic reboot is fuzzy, family-friendly fare.The chorus of one of the songs declares, 'I've got everything that I need, right in front of me.' For 120 minutes, that's precisely how I felt.You can rest easy - if you have previously loved the Muppets, you will likely currently love The Muppets.It reminds us how much we love Kermit, Fozzie, Miss Piggy, Animal, the Swedish Chef and all the rest, and it lets a lot of famous people -- among them Feist, Emily Blunt and Neil Patrick Harris -- pop up to express their own affection.Fun songs, great humor, and a lot of entertaining cameos make The Muppets a fun movie for both adults and children. It's a good revitalization of the Muppets franchise.Where have they been? Young or old, there's nothing better than spending a few hours with the Muppets.A delighted woman behind me almost needed oxygen as she watched Camilla and her singing chicken gals do a cheeky, clucking rendition of Cee Lo Green's \"Forget You.\"Those who fondly remember \"The Muppet Show\" will get a kick out of seeing old friends again; those who don't just might realize what they missed.At their best, the Muppets embody a sort of moral anarchy, as the weirdest stuff can happen at any given moment, but you know it's going to be funny and you know no one is going to get hurt (they are just puppets after all).The hilarious, genuinely uplifting Muppets provides hope that, even when suppressed, enthusiastic optimism lives on, just waiting for a chance to sing again.The cameos are a blast, but the human leads really shine, especially Adams, who is so effortlessly sunny she qualifies as special effect.We'll give Jason Segel et al credit for trying and it's incredibly hard to fully fault a movie with such a terrific finale.A nice throwback to the muppets we know and love and it will assuredly speak to a new crowd as well as touch an old one.During The Muppets' numerous highlights, movie-going is rarely this much fun.Henson's Muppets had a nice line in dry wit. They were anarchic. Segel's are corporate stooges.Beneath the cleverness you'll find warmth, sweetness and real affection for our fine felt friends.full review at Movies for the MassesDisney's \"The Muppets\" is a solid family movie that breathes new life into an old franchise. Who'd have thought that were even possible?Warrants multiple viewings. I am currently considering raising my children on this film. If you don't come out feeling complete joy, you might want to check with your parents that they didn't find you in a crashed spaceship in a cornfield.If you're not a joyless maniac with a soul of anthracite then you will work hard to imagine how this project could have been better handled.Everything here just works. Its weird, colorful world is breath of cinema fresh air. The Muppets is a world where you just have to believe that these \"muppets\" are real and not question the whys and how of it.An energetic return to form reminding audiences, both young and old, why everyone should love The Muppets.It is with immense pleasure that I can report that Disney's Muppet reboot movie is an absolute delight.You don't know what you've got till it's gone, and it turns out the movie world has been a lesser place without the Muppets.The whole thing is ultimately too in awe of its own characters, respecting them without pushing them, to feel as fresh and sharp as The Muppet Movie.The Muppets may have been born out of a desire to revive a dormant franchise that was once a cash cow, but there isn't a single beat in the film that feels crass or opportunistic. This one is from the heart.The challenge Disney has with The Muppets is to show a new generation what the fuss was all about. Slam-dunk. The movie slaps a smile on your face you won't want to wipe off.I don't know why The Muppets faded away over the last couple of decades, but [this film] proves that they still have plenty of heart and smart-assness to give to a new generation and beyond.After too long an absence in the spotlight, this movie is a vivid reminder of how much we all could use some Muppets in our lives.I'm fiercely protective of these old friends -- and I believe that the great Jim Henson would be very pleased with this movie.No matter who you're taking to the movies, and even if you're going by yourself, you can't go wrong with this one.Mostly, The Muppets is a cry for decency from a couple of guys who have done their part to coarsen the culture - which may be the greatest irony of all.For kids, blessedly unironic by nature until wised up by nurture, the movie is just shiny, funny, and filled with songs...This delightful film boasts catchy songs, funny dialogue and nostalgic sequences -- as well as human characters almost as lovable as the Muppets themselves.As a died-in-the-wool Muppets fan, this overripe nostalgia trip only almost captures that Henson magic. There are moments of exhuberance, but they're scattered and isolated.Segel and his collaborators do right by the Muppets, setting them up for a new generation of fans while honoring what made them so appealing in the first place.Even when it gets bogged down in angst and misconceived moments -- a Muppetized take on \"We Built This City\" belongs on the cutting-room floor -- The Muppets remains fundamentally likeable.There are a few stumbles, but not too many, and by the time Gary and Walter get to a showstopping number that asks the burning question - \"Am I a man, or a Muppet?\" - you are completely hooked.Blending self-deprecating comic asides with high-spirited showmanship, the movie captures the essence of Jim Henson's classic 1970s TV show and 1979's The Muppet Movie.They're back in excellent form, honoring the legacy built by Henson, and moviegoers and longtime Muppet nerds owe a debt of gratitude to Muppet superfan Segel for having the nerve to keep asking for a shot at making a film with them.The plot, as you may well imagine, is secondary to the barrage of jokes, songs, fourth-wall violations, and occasional celebrity cameos that are part and parcel of the big-screen Muppet experience.This new musical comedy is pretty close to being the most sensational, inspirational, celebrational, Muppetational effort to hit screens this year.Thanks Muppets, for reminding me what I am supposed to be, and how life's a happy song when there's someone by your side to sing along.Frequently hilarious and quite poignant, especially when Kermit reminisces about his long lost friends while crooning a wonderful little ditty called \"Pictures in My Head\"The glaring omission of Elmo (due to legal wrangling) is the only weak-spot in this delightfully sweet music-infused family film.\"The Muppets,\" the troupe's first film in more than a decade, is a more aggressively absurd antidote to what it calls \"a hard, cynical world.\" Happily, it works.It's time to see the Muppets, it's time to see this show.A jovial tribute to the spirit of the old television series that's witty without being cynical and warm without going gooey.'Muppets' is a fantastic, furry throwback.Kermit the Frog rounds up the gang to save the Muppets' derelict old theatre from a ruthless tycoon in this laugh-out-loud return to the enduring TV characters' roots.A witty script, catchy songs, strong comic performances and a host of delightfully funny celebrity cameos.Welcome back, Muppets.Director Bobin milks laughter and tears in generous, equal measures, leaving us hankering for more.The film's broad smiles and big-heartedness are bracingly disingenuous, the self-referential jokes well handled. Only the affection emanating from the audience is sincere.If, like me, you are a parent, there will be something life affirming about taking your children to see these ageless old friends.Unfortunately the pang of loss - the \"you can't go back again\" - is reflected in the film's own inability go back again. After a meditative midsection it tries to re-establish cuteness and comic zeal.Kermit, we're sorry we forgot about you - never leave again.I hope this movie will bring these talented artistes back to the forefront of the entertainment industry. It deserves to.If Segel's efforts aren't quite sensational, that's okay. They're still inspirational, celebrational and - most important - Muppetational, a concept that's been in sadly short supply as of late.For all the diverting fun and silly gags, along with Fozzie Bear's fart-shoes and Miss Piggy's infinite ego, the Muppets make it their business not to condescend to their viewers.",

        "document": "Jamie Foxx hasn't been this good in years in a truly funny performance that wouldn't have been out of place in \"Fargo.\"Saying it's not horrible is another way of saying that this movie is consistently disappointing.It starts off at a slight remove from reality and gets sillier and sillier as it goes along; our only responsibility is to hang on and enjoy the ride.The smartest thing about \"Horrible Bosses\" is that it both refuses to just clock in and waste time - and, at the same time, works extra hard to hold our attention.I certainly laughed enough during it to give it a recommendation, especially for anyone who has a strong stomach for profanity and a desire to see Jennifer Aniston absolutely trashing her good-girl image. (Full Content Parental Review also available)Takes a thin premise and milks it for all its worth, riding a witty script and super-strong cast to comedic glory.The stars lack the charisma, the comic energy and the overall appeal of the A-listers playing supporting roles. That's a fundamental miscalculation.Black comedy at its most delicious.A ragtag R-rated comedy that ekes out just enough big laughs to make it worth your time.What's right about Horrible Bosses is less easy to identify, but it comes down to something like esprit de corps.If the names Curly, Larry and Moe mean anything to you, then Horrible Bosses is a film you should not miss.Everyone is having a good time making this film and, unlike some, they're able to share that with the audience.It's far from perfect, but it features more laughs than Bad Teacher and The Hangover Part II combined.A guilty pleasure for anyone who hates their boss, this is original, superbly performed and wickedly funny.As far-fetched and filthy-minded as the film often gets, there is a subversive universal appeal in play that keeps lingering doubts at bay.he trio's hysteria mounts in a manner conspicuously designed to conjure up comparisons with the panic experienced by the boys in The Hangover.A fun, lively chemistry between Nick, Kurt and Dale keeps this snappy story whipping along from gag to gag at a merciless pace.Hangover filmmakers, this is how you do it.Whilst the bosses are unnecessarily over-the-top, the film still manages to work as a light-hearted buddy comedy.No-holds-barred humour, an up-for-anything all-star cast and a fast, madcap energy make this one of the best comedies you'll see in 2011.Horrible Bosses may not be ground-breaking comedy, but it *is* comedy.The troubling thing isn't that the rampant sexual humor is so crude, but that it's so angry.It didn't make me laugh all that much, but strangely kept me more interested in the story. I admit that watching a movie this dumb for the story is like reading Playboy for the ads.A movie afraid to follow through on its nasty premise, leaving just a handful of mildly amusing jokes and a sense of lost potential.Add Horrible Bosses to the list of absolutely great comedies we've been given in the past ten years.\"Horrible Bosses\" has no meaning or purpose whatever, but it does have Colin Farrell with a bad comb-over, Kevin Spacey acting really mean and Jennifer Aniston as a spray-tanned sex maniac, and that's going to have to do.The script has some good lines, the premise is quite enjoyable, the execution is solid and the performances, by all actors involved, put the film over the top.\"Horrible Bosses\" isn't horrible at all -- it's easy, raunchy fun in the manner of the first \"Hangover\" movie (and far better than the second).Horrible Bosses succeeds almost entirely on the chemistry of its three leads, who remain likeable even while resorting to homicide.There are few comedy pleasures better suited to the medium of movies than that of watching supposedly normal people behaving terribly. And if those transgressing characters are played by popular movie stars, so much the better.What's the point of a black comedy that doesn't go for the kill?it's ironically refreshing that a film with the word \"horrible\" baked right into its title would end up being absolutely fantasticAniston's never been funnier than she is as a raunchy, sex-crazed dentist.There's an underlying, nearly universal relatability to \"Horrible Bosses\" that can't be denied and that screenwriters Michael Markowitz, John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein use to great advantage.\"Horrible Bosses\" provides a nifty showcase for the Jasons and for Charlie Day as three reasonably nice guys who have varying and solid reasons for wishing their bosses dead.Bits that could have courted actual darkness \u0155 la Very Bad Things-violence, venality, vindictive sex-simply register as dank shock-jock gags done with little courage, and even less conviction.They are harmless assassins, which is why we are laughing instead of being horrified.Funny; really, consistently funny, with a first-class ear for non sequitur, a fast pace, and a half dozen of the year's best comic performances.A jubilant, vulgar, and extremely funny farce.... Day, Sudeikis, and Bateman are a dream team of comic actors.Look at how crazy is the craziness we are doing for you. Isn't it crazy? the movie shouts, and the more it does, the less you'll laugh.It's over-the-top stuff, to be sure. But Bosses never crosses that line into the macabre. Don't call in sick to this shift.Never dark, witty, or smart enough (the line '[She's] had the crazy f***ed out of her' is up for 2011's Laziest Misogyny Joke), the murder-your-boss plot also lags and jags.Overall, a pleasant surprise.At least our would-be murderers enjoy an easy rapport, and this may provide some distraction as the pace slackens and plot continues to go nowhere.Yet another unoriginal and out-of-touch Hollywood comedy prizing its R cert status over substance.The would-be assassins' hopelessly bungling efforts produce a steady supply of laughs, though the jokes are rude and crude and the meandering plot doesn't make the most of the film's set-up. Fortunately, the actors rise above the script.It's horrible, all right.Seth Gordon rolls up his sleeves and shows the comedy pretenders exactly who's boss.Enjoyable comedy that succeeds thanks to strong comic performances and a string of funny gags, though it also frequently squanders its potential and a little bit of depth would have gone a long way.It's a shame the story is so flimsy, because the casting is solid.Gordon knows what works and what doesn't, pushing the leads' chummy chemistry to the fore while allowing the schematic and, frankly, highly unlikely murder plot to sink into the background.Would I have really enjoyed this trio-in-trouble comedy if I hadn't felt it was a force feed of the Hangover formula?This foul-mouthed effort coasts on its leads' strong three-way chemistry and crack timing.Horrible Bosses is entertaining and brazen, a clear reminder that to make a good comedy, all you've really gotta do is make it funny.If you're like me, you won't entirely hate it ... but you may hate yourself in the morning.It's one of those revolting, raunch-fueled movies churned out in their sleep by the Farrelly brothers and Judd Apatow that I usually hate, but with real cleverness, off-center wit and edgy imagination.It's a film that's wildly, brazenly stupid -- but also, you know, fun.No point lamenting the missed opportunity for a really dark satire, because they were never going to make that movie. At least this trio kept it entertaining.Although the premise is far-fetched and the plot at times ridiculous, there's enough comedic firepower in Seth Gordon's film to carry you over the rough patches.The movie sounds like a high-concept commercial comedy, but it's quite funny and the whip-smart script contributes to the level of enjoyment of the cast.[VIDEO] A much more successful bromance comedy than \"The Hangover 2,\" \"Horrible Bosses\" benefits from the volatile comic mixture of chemistry between its actors, as well as a genuinely quirky script.The screenplay ... goes about the expected route in regards to the protagonists' superiors ... but it's in the central characters' actions that the film truly finds its edge.Sustained by recession-era resentment fantasies, strong plot structure, and a bunch of top comic performers enjoying themselves so much it is impossible not to join them.A film as coarse, bluntly obvious and irritatingly self-conscious as its title, only nowhere near as funny.Whether it might have meant delving into grimmer thriller territory or bending toward more courageously incendiary humor, the finished cut screams out for a clearer, firmer, fuller vision.Another movie for fans of rude/crude humorThe talented cast and colorful vulgarities work overtime to cover for a lack of coherence, but they can only distract for so long.Horrible Bosses is without question the funniest movie released so far this year, and the slyest raunch-com to date.Day, who was the best thing about last years rom-com \"Going the Distance,\" is hilarious here.Hollywood, ever-sensitive to the heated scent of the national zeitgeist, is in the business of trotting out movies that greedily feed on subliminal obsessions.Considering how many other summer comedies deserve to be fired for cause and walked out of the building by security with their stuff in a filing box, Horrible Bosses does the job well enough.Horrible Bosses is the most repellent example yet of a trend for Hollywood to rely on the lowest common denominator from the first frame to last.It's not very tightly plotted or precisely scripted but the three leads have lots of obvious camaraderie and energy together - confirmed in a bloopers reel after the end credits - which help to keep the film moving along.Gordon has the good sense to simply step aside here, letting his cast goof around and bounce off of one another like so many rubber balls.It's tempting to label Horrible Bosses a post-Hangover comedy. For all I know it may have been in the works before that box-office smash saw the light of day, but it emits the same vibe, even if it doesn't go to the same extremes...I must be lagging in comedy trends. First I missed the boat on full frontal male nudity, now I'm just catching up on sexual assault humor.Isn't there some little corner of Hollywood that still believes in the sweet and charming?The sub-Porky's style humour elicits a few guffaws, but a little more wit and subtlety would have helped.These bosses cannot justify either murder or lasting comic memories, fatally compromising a farce that could have been great but ends up merely mediocre.A hugely satisfying sacrificial culling of those at the top ... makes for a seriously refreshing tonic after a hard week's graft.The skilled comedian Bateman has the best moments, underplaying when all about him are going over the top.With stellar comic timing from the entire ensemble and a dark streak of edgy humor with just enough wit to make it not seem cruel, this is one of the straight-up funniest movies of the year.Even though its satirical edge is tempered by slap-stick gags, the movie will employ your funny bone without challenging you to think too deeply.Here is a curveball for a comedy home-run. But at its best, Horrible Bosses is a blooper.Probably isn't horrible enough to excite younger viewers and will certainly not attract anyone else.What passes for comedy here doesn't have a chance against a thesis so scary and sad.The funniest film since The Hangover. The ideal cast makes the outlandish premise work in this silly, clever summer comedy, as shrewdly played and hilarious as they come.Like The Hangover, the genius of Horrible Bosses lies in the fact it takes the simplest of concepts and builds upon it with hilarious non-stop laughs.On the frat-comedy tolerance scale, this noir-comedy just about breaks even.A lightweight, mildly ribald farce that offers some stray laughs, smothered in a morass of 'Three Stooges'-style dumbness.Basically, \"Horrible Bosses\" is a handful of characters and a comic situation in search of something to do for 100 minutes.Though sporadically funny, this revenge comedy about emasculated males in the workplace is more talk when it should go balls-out insane.Watching good actors let their hair down can be fun, but watching them let their standards down isn't.You'll get your laughs, but you'll also wish it had gone for the throat in the end.It's been argued that movie comedies no longer have jokes. I would go one step further. The similarly titled (and similarly sloppy) Bad Teacher and Horrible Bosses barely even have stories.The best workplace comedy since \"Office Space.\"A lot of low-stakes humor, occasionally brought off by a mostly ingratiating cast.As raunchy as \"Bridesmaids\" and \"Hangover 2\" but missing the good characters; these guys are just stupid.a crowd-pleaserThe leads, and the bosses, provide fleeting pleasures.It's not as dark as you imagine, but it will get you grinning.I will watch Bateman, Sudeikis and Day do anything, especially kill their bosses.[Has] absolutely no idea what to do with a really swell concept once it gets past the exposition stage.The characters in Horrible Bosses are defined by their quirks, which are spelled out in boldface.Watching these three chuckleheads plot their revenge never stops being entertaining.Smarter ideas about revenge, politics and labor are all off the table, and that's weird for a movie where the title promises angry catharsis for everyone who's fortunate enough to even have an employer to hate in the first place.A foul-mouthed, anatomically obsessed and downright fun black comedy.There are laughs elsewhere in this crude comedy, but the film lights up the most when supporting player Jamie Foxx shows up and steals every scene he's in.It may not be the funniest film of the year, but it's the only really funny one opening this weekend. Surely a little gratitude is in order.Heavy on action, light on character depth and utterly over-the-top, Horrible Bosses is best approached by removing the veneer of plausibility and, to paraphrase the title of a far lesser Jennifer Aniston picture, just going with it.The movie's amusing enough, and its plot twisty enough, that you can gloss over the half-baked elements.If you're bright enough to count your change at the popcorn stand, you're too smart to see \"Horrible Bosses.\"\"Horrible Bosses\" is like a loud water-cooler routine that you're forced to endure before suggesting to your crass co-workers that they should get back to work.Here's a hit-and-miss farce that leaves you wishing it was funnier than it is. Why? Because it wussies out on a sharp premise. Because it wastes a killer cast that's ready to rock it.This moronic screenwriting through swearing does little to generate laughs and only would appear to represent creative freedom or boundary pushing to a cast used to working under television censorship laws.If you're looking for a bit of undemanding fun with a few really good laughs, you could do a lot worse than this.I'm not kidding when I tell you I have worked for a reasonable facsimile of each of the 'Horrible Bosses' depicted in this grownups-only movie.Another frantic bad-boy comedy, with a good premise rendered depressingly inane by characters whose behavior barely makes sense.The movie's main thrust is lowball wish fulfillment, which comes too cheaply.A mess.Horrible Bosses is a sloppy \u2028film that wants to be an edgy black comedy but doesn't come close to pushing the envelope enough.An affable, entertaining comedy...This is a story for which plausibility took a running jump off a belief-suspension bridge.It's refreshing to see that some writers still like to turn an intriguing situation into one where laughs can flow naturally as opposed to attempting to force them out with extremely bad jokes.With this cast, and this concept, it's just a shame that \"Horrible Bosses\" pulls up just when it should be taking off.A star-studded black comedy for anyone who's ever fantasised about killing their boss.A ramshackle assembly of recycled characters and conflicting tones, duct-taped together at odd angles.This vulgar comedy is mediocre at best with some fun performances but few jokes that actually work.Funny enough to give America's embattled working folk an outlet for their frustration, and America's employer classes a bad case of nerves.Rides the entertaining pitch for the entire runtime -- without attempting to offer some kind of deeper insight or social commentary.Horrible Bosses is very funny and features a great cast that exudes wonderful chemistry.Colin Farrell is a comedy genius.Horrible Bosses offers a reminder that adherence to formula may not be among the signal virtues of comedy, but--provided the jokes are funny--it's no great vice either.While not likely to become the ultimate in \"I hate my job\" fury a la Office Space, it offers enough bitter laughs to be fun.The raunchy comedy about a trio of fed-up employees who exact revenge on their freak-show employers wickedly doles out the just deserts, and that's what it makes it so much fun.The movie has just enough raunchiness to identify it as a 2011 comedy, just enough cleverness to admire, and just the right camaraderie among its three male stars, which turns out to be the movie's greatest strength. Bateman plays straight-man...Wonderfully mean-spirited, one sick joke piled atop another ... Farrell's cheesy, coke-head boss is the real surprise. Foxx has a great time in a role that can be taken as a knowing goof on the street-smart hit man.The coarseness wouldn't be so bad if at least the steady stream of obscenities were funny. But there is, after all, an art to talking dirty.Horrible Bosses won't make you forget \"Office Space,\" but you'll be laughing too much to mind.Energy, chemistry, timing, and a palpable sense of raunchy fun.As they say, the best laid plans go oft awry. So what transpires in a comedy about the worst-laid schemes? These guys don't seem built for premeditated murder but are perfectly capable of mayhem.Director Seth Gordon gives us few thrills, little danger and no growth-potential.Fun, throwaway, unofficial remake of the classic 1980 workplace comedy Nine to Five.As sloppy and unbelievable as the movie is, it is at times very funny -- a series of ridiculous setups to get these three talented comic actors in uncomfortable positions so they can make us laugh.While it may only be an average comedy, derivative of better things, these days it appears we have to be thankful for what's available.Squanders a promising dark premise and attractive production values for puerile gross-out humor, 'shocking' sex talk, lazy plotting and a desperate and almost literal deus ex machina ending.a subversively prescient black comedyto trio toy Gordon badizei se diadromes klasikoy buddy movie, arwmatismenes me mia tzoyra apo noyar doloplokies, gia na sthsei tis kwmikes eksarseis poy soy exoyn apokalypsei edw kai kati mhnes ta trailerFlawed, and not nearly as dark as it could be, but Horrible Bosses excels if only because of the fun performances and great chemistry of the cast.Horrible movie. One of the five worst films of 2011.... An ingenious though not quite original premise, genuine wit and a fantastic cast.Forget The Hangover: Part II and Bridesmaids. Horrible Bosses was the funniest movie of this past summer.I laughed, but even as I laughed, I was frustrated by the potential that feels unfulfilled.It could almost be argued that Horrible Bosses' general middle of the road, vanilla, just-good-enough nature is actually on purpose, a reflection of the lead characters' own qualities.Two-thirds of a funny movie, Horrible Bosses takes its irresistible premise an admirable distance before pulling a Wrong Way Corrigan and heading in an alternate direction ... Still, there are plenty of laughs to be mined.After watching this trio of bumbling schemers get in and out of trouble with a series of crazy shenanigans and listening to the filthy dialogue, you will feel like taking a long, hot shower to wash away any recollection of sitting through this garbage.Don't miss Horrible BossesAn overindulgence in coarse language exposing profanity as the hobgoblins of small minds and unimaginative scripts.For something like Horrible Bosses to sparkle, the actors have to shine... and shine they do.Yet another comedy dud of 2011.The complete comedy that achieves the near-impossible --- consistent hilarity from beginning to end.The laughs in this film come fast and furious. Bateman, Sudeikis and Day are absolutely perfect together.It should be titled Horrible Comedy.Outrageously crude, silly farce that works because of the cast's comedic timing.Those bosses, man... they're horrible.Bateman, Day and Sudeikis are ideally cast, and have the good timing of comedy pros.Gordon and company really killed it.This nastily funny, ultimate wish-fulfilling black comedy should prove a hit with summer audiences, all too glad to be out of the office.Spotty in its commitment to the darker elements of the material, but damn if this is not an example of actors taking control of nearly every scene and turning it into one of the more consistently funny efforts of the year.Bateman, Day and Sudeikis have a natural camaraderie on-screen, and it's fun to ride this runaway train as events careen forward.Horrible Bosses is consistently funny, but it lacks the driving pace and frenetic energy that it so desperately needs.It may be 9 to 5 stripped of its feminist bite and much of its dark potential, but it's still a fun ride through the sketchier neighborhoods of the working man's mind.This is a fantasy along the lines of 9 to 5: coarser, less realistic about corporate culture, but just as much a fantasy of revenge for everyone humiliated or exploited by a supervisor.Even its most reprehensible characters - like Farrell's superbly nasty autocrat, whose first act upon taking over the company is to order Sudeikis to fire all the fat people - brim with perverse joie de vivre.Slow-witted, clumsy and almost pathologically reliant on crude name-calling for laughs ... Horrible Bosses represents the lowest end of the comedy spectrum.Gordon, who made the terrific documentary \"The King of Kong,\" is still a little wobbly when it comes to fiction. Fortunately, his outstanding cast steadies all but the most uneven moments.The screenplay is a hit and miss; but there are some laughs....laugh out loud funny.Horrible Bosses is not the kind of comedy that delivers many gut-busting laughs. You know the guffaws I'm talking about - the ones that leave your sleeves completely saturated from dabbing away the tears that stream down your face. But ...Horrible Bosses takes a dark premise -- three buddies band together to off their bosses -- and rings it for a solid, steady stream of laughs.Uneven, but funny.Horrible Bosses follows the precedent set by such earlier crime-gone-awry comedies as Ruthless People (1986), Throw Momma from the Train (1987) and Bottle Rocket (1996) with gut-busting gusto.If this year's hit \"Bridesmaids\" is the woman's answer to the male-driven, R-rated comedy, then \"Horrible Bosses\" is a strong rebuttal.When added altogether, Horrible Bosses gets the job done but is not recommended for advancement.Still, Day's scene involving a mountain of cocaine is hyperspeed-hilarious, Farrell's unhinged, irrational fuming is marvelously cretinous, and Aniston's fully committed sex-addict sexpot act is wickedly absurd.'Horrible Bosses' Appeal Clocks Out Early... nonstop profanity, raunchy sex scenes and general tastelessness ... also absolutely hilarious ...The plot is ... flimsy and the three screenwriters struggle to bring the murderous mayhem to a satisfying conclusion.Made with the same kind of raucous, raw energy the first Hangover film delivered, Horrible Bosses dares to go for broke and is deliciously bold, over-the-top and vulgarAdult without being crass, goofy without being stupid, Bosses is one of the funniest films of the year.If the film works at all - and it mostly does - it's because of Bateman's performance (speaking of sympathetic: he could have played Patrick Bateman and made him seem adorable).La broma m\u00e1s o menos funciona siempre que uno no espere una obra maestra de la comedia (no lo es) ni una \u00e1cida cr\u00edtica sobre las relaciones laborales en el mundo corporativo de hoy (tampoco es el caso).I laughed frequently, probably to the detriment of my self-respect.A popcorn comedy you shouldn't be ashamed of wanting to see.Acaba entregando sua falta de confian\u00e7a na pr\u00f3pria qualidade em seus cr\u00e9ditos finais, que trazem a marca inconfund\u00edvel de uma com\u00e9dia sem gra\u00e7a: erros de filmagem.If the R rated comedy were a man, and it would almost certainly be a man, then he'd be a lad; a boy; an overly gregarious, beer soaked, open shirted alpha with a rapacious sexuality.Seeks approval by establishing a sloppy routine of shock and improvisation, slapping viewers with pedestrian acts of misbehavior when something far more macabre was in order.Director Seth Gordon and his trio of screenwriters needed to give this script another wash or two. But once the movie hits its stride, it's a decent enough laugh-fest to garner a marginal letter of recommendation.Jason Bateman, Charlie Day, and Jason Sudeikis are pals who decide to knock off their miserable bosses, and their conspiracy leads in all sorts of unexpected directions in this crowd-pleasing, occasionally funny farce.\"Horrible Bosses\" is funny and dirty in about that order.The laughter is mean but also oddly pure: it expels shame and leaves you feeling dizzy, a little embarrassed and also exhilarated, kind of like the cocaine that two of the main characters consume by accident.Cleverly structured, \"Horrible Bosses\" works in spite of its cruder, scrotum-centric instincts.A safe pitch down the middle in a genre better left to those capable of throwing curveballs.Moving on from terrorists as the reigning stock villains, to those who mercilessly dictate whatever the content of your weekly paycheck. And clocking in at theaters none too soon as get-even office drudge gore, on the heels of this economic crisis.Red band trailers don't suggest how low this movie stoops for laughs, or reveal how diabolically it turns the 9 to 5 fantasy of murdering an employer into screwball hilarity. Think of The Hangover as directed by Alfred Hitchcock and get the idea.It may not be the summer's funniest comedy (that would be Bridesmaids), but it's safe to say it's the most killer one.",

It's both beautiful and grisly, lyric and sinister.As absurd and as beautiful as a fairy tale.This is a truly haunting horror movie.A marvellous movie in the fullest sense.It infects your dreams with dread and desperation.Amazingly, all the excesses and derangements of filming since that time have not muffled the dream force of Franju's vision.Like a nightmare that never ends, this is a vision of madness, loneliness and, yes, horror that, once seen, demands to be viewed over and over again. It is that haunting, and that good.A modernist horror film infused with the spirit of the silent avant gardeFranju constructs an elegant visual work; here is a horror movie in which the shrieks are not by the characters but by the images.A blood-curdling picture directed by Georges Franju at an even, distant pace that builds tension to an almost unbearable level.Long before plastic surgery became the vogue in Beverly Hills, a 1960 horror classic proved its power to destroy the relationship between a father and daughter.Told with the surrealism of a Jean Cocteau film and with the fanciful style of \"Metropolis\" and Fritz Lang, this is a great classic that warrants discovery, or re-discovery!",

        "document": "Between this cast and the conviction Jarecki brings to the table, the film feels incredibly accomplished for a first feature.Between Gere matching wits with a police detective played by Tim Roth and him having to explain himself to the steely Sarandon, Arbitrage is never dull.Jarecki invests his film with a great sense of pacing and tension. It's a well-crafted plot, effortlessly juggling financial and family drama, with a Colombo-esque complication nipping at its heels.The stakes of Arbitrage never feel quite high enough, no matter how good it all looks.Two movies in one- only one of which is good. Despite it's flaws, Gere is incredible in the performance of his life.Contrivance does indeed flare up, but that's part of the fun, all the more reason for a fat cat to squirm and sweat over the course of a week in his life and 100 minutes of running time.Jarecki, it's clear, has the talent to make shrewdly pleasurable Hollywood movies. Here's hoping Arbitrage is the first of many.Arbitrage is competing between the narrative form of the corporate thriller and the inherent corruption and irresponsibility of those embedded in the industry. Unfortunately it breaks even.Tim Roth turns in a momentous performance as a detective in a movie showing that billionaires do not always have it made.'Arbitrage' switches genres mid-movie and pulls you every which way dramatically but never connects you to any emotions that matter.A crisp, procedural-type throwback to 1980s-style financial world thrillers about rich men behaving badly and skirting danger.For all the satisfying ironies that are dished up... some of what we're served is hopelessly naive.Arbitrage is the story of one rich man's downward spiral where both sides lie to try to get what they want but both walk away empty handed. It all results in a standstill that is about as thrilling as a staring contest.Arbitrage avoids lazy, anti-corporate talking points to tell the thrilling story of a man drowning in his own greed.Inadvertently pandering on just about every level, except for the end credits, which are quite likely intended to rapidly vacate the theater for the next screening.If there were a movie about Mitt Romney, no one other than Richard Gere could play him.Whether there is even the possibility of redemption at the end is part of what makes the film so gripping.Richard Gere turns in a fine, nuanced performance of a very complicated character, Robert Miller, head of a hedge fund who made a bad financial bet on a Russian copper mine.Contains the kind of conventions that are fun to revisit with a skilled director and a game cast.Not worth a trip to the theater, but it might be worth catching on TV some day you've got nothing better to do.Arbitrage is a rewarding, thought-provoking movie that deserves to find a wide audience.This is a gleaming movie about a man with his back to the wall, facing disgrace on several fronts and the possibility of exchanging his Armani suit for prison garb.An absorbing character study that teases some vicarious revenge on a perfidious member of the billionaire's club.Richard Gere is terrific and the supporting cast do superb jobs in this fascinating exploration of greed, justice and the law.Arbitrage is the kind of classily put-together film that actors, filmmakers and grown-up audiences frequently complain no longer gets made.It's the way Gere and director Nicholas Jarecki create sympathy for the devil that makes this so gripping.As we follow the increasingly frantic Gere down his nightmarish rabbit hole, the picture takes a satisfyingly cold, amoral stance - less critique and more cynical observation.Aside from Gere's performance, there's really not much to see here.A Wall Street-thriller blending elements of Chappaquiddick with a pinch of John Edwards and a whole lot of Bernie Madoff.Like something straight out of 1992, Nicholas Jarecki's debut feature Arbitrage ... is a small scale, high-gloss thriller that feels like Wall Street's cousin.Nicholas Jarecki's Arbitrage is at once a beautifully complex, effortlessly compelling legal thriller and a heated, passionate political allegory, working wonderfully on both levels.But Arbitrage crackles back to life when Gere is on screen racing around New York City frantically trying to keep his house of cards from collapsing down around him.Richard Gere is the only real reason to see 'Arbitrage'With a story like this, you need strong, compelling performances and wow did we get them. Richard Gere, along with Michael Douglas, is my favorite rich guy. They're 1 and 1A and in this Richard Gere is beyond watchable.The real standout is Tim Roth as a streetwise New York City detective who's seen it all and can spot a liar a mile away.It moves a little slow, but for me it had me from the get-go. I wanted to know what's gonna happen next; surprised when the film took it's various turns and it made me realize that I never wanna be this rich, way too much responsibility.Straddling the line between celebration and vilification of its nasty protagonist, Arbitrage plunges into the world of corporate fraud with chilly detachment.An elegantly crafted potboiler that fires on all cylinders, giving Gere his juiciest role yet.For the first two acts, Jarecki paces out the story's various twists and turns quite well.Giving the tale an extra dose of reality is Richard Gere.\"Arbitrage\" becomes far more complex than just dramatized anti-corporate polemic, or even a simple fall from grace.Primetime dramas share similar plot points, but Gere elevates the proceedings with a positively commanding performance - his finest in ages.Mediocre at best.I'm not sure any five pages of this script by director Nicholas Jarecki hold together.If not for Gere, whose ever-wearying performance suggests a man who is as fed up with himself as we are of him, this could have a very different movie.A well-crafted dramatic thriller with a rare braininess and a deeply unsettling undercurrent.Features an exceedingly dapper Richard Gere in a series of nice suits and handsome close-ups that serve no purpose other than to remind us how exceedingly dapper Richard Gere looks in nice suits and handsome close-ups.The director's first stroke of genius is in convincing you to empathize... with Robert, the puppetmaster who seduces everyone around him...Arbitrage overcomes some pulpy plot twists and a little anti-corporate sermonizing to become a brisk tale of a financial wizard whose sins have returned to collect a debt.Here's an old-fashioned thriller-cum-morality play that trades in compelling characters and sharp storytelling.Like Gere's Machiavellian tycoon, Arbitrage's flaws only start to appear under close scrutiny.What elegant pulp this is, and how inelegantly I gobbled it up.We are persuaded to root for Miller, even when he is betraying the people he loves best. You'll feel dirty, and well you should after a few hours in this company.Richard Gere delivers such a charming, layered performance that he overcomes a contrived plot that piles too many financial and personal crises on the central character.Writer-director Nicholas Jarecki, making his debut picture, has delivered a satisfying, grown-up drama, if not the definitive film about the financial crisis.Arbitrage is a slick, intelligent psychological thriller that works to connect public and private immorality.An old-fashioned treat.Golden Globe-nominated Gere gives a cool and charming performance and is ably supported by Susan Sarandon and Tim Roth.Gere is matchless in this kind of role. The lacquered crinkle of the smile; the corrugated silk hair; the eyes deep-pouched and glinting like coins in a rich man's wallet.He's been An Officer And A Gentleman, An American Gigolo and Mr Pretty Woman, now Richard Gere is back in a smart and stylish thriller, Arbitrage.A shrewd satisfying thriller with a magical twist in Gere's performance. Instead of a demonized tycoon - Bernie Madoff as Satan - we see a fully-realized character.Richard Gere's performance in the sinfully entertaining Arbitrage is too good to ignore. At 62, he is at the peak of his powers.The main reason to see Arbitrage is Gere, whose steady improvement with age (he just turned 63) is not remarked upon enough.There's a touch of Hitchcockian flavor to the Arbitrage's cat-and-mouse thrills, yet the film clearly announces that there's now a third gifted Jarecki brother (in addition to Eugene and Andrew) to contend with in the moviemaking business.Its best attribute is Gere's performance. He hasn't been this good in ages.\"Arbitrage\" gets away with a few crime-flick cliches because it's also a thoughtful character study.Even if you're put off by their hot-and-cold-running-cashmere lifestyle, it's ultimately impossible not to be moved by a daughter who is heartbroken when the father she worships betrays her.Gere does his best to give Arbitrage an agitated energy, but Jarecki's fatalism works against the film.Although it never ties together as securely as it should, Arbitrage carries itself with a confident sense of gloom and panic, keeping the mysteries at hand persuasive despite storytelling that flames out instead of building ominously.Paced like a slick '80s thriller but themed for millennial relevance, \"Arbitrage\" splits the difference with a confidently cruising Gere.The screenplay, written by first-time director Nicholas Jarecki, keeps us guessing, which is one of the best compliments one can pay to a movie of this sort.The latest 'Richard Gere under pressure movie.'These Wall Street magnates... they're taking their hits as the villains of the day in post-Enron, post-AIG, post-Lehman Brothers, post-Bernie Madoff America. The breed is getting its just condemnations, but...Savvy, slick and suspenseful financial thriller.Arbitrage is the latest in a long line of movies with touches of Alfred Hitchcock's DNA. The film reverberates with themes such as deception, ethical ambiguity, and the impact of fate.\"Arbitrage\" is one of those films that doesn't rely on flourish to succeed, and in the end, it's probably better off without it.The rich show they are different in this superb thriller in which honesty and dishonesty are bedfellows... a sophisticated film that grapples with many issues ranging from the superficial to the nitty grittyIt boasts solid performances from Gere and Sarandon, yet feels overly familiar, even predictable, at times.This isn't very effective as a thriller, though it's a provocative fable about our ambivalent feelings toward financial elites.Playing a character that's almost entirely unsympathetic, Gere demonstrates the outward charm that's allowed Miller to accumulate his wealth and status, as well as the abyss-staring soul his showmanship conceals.Rather than seeming pat, Jarecki's straightforward cynicism is pointed and purposeful.\"Arbitrage\" is a fine showcase for the silky talents of Richard Gere, who's so smooth here you could spread him on toast.A tense and chilling horror story for financially fraught times.It could readily be mistaken for the work of an experienced and justifiably self-confident filmmaker with a nose for newsy stories, a knack for telling them tersely, and a gift for directing actorsUnfolding in somber tones and among hard surfaces, Arbitrage has the slickness of new bank notes and the confidence of expensive tailoring.Mr. Gere is one of cinema's great walkers, graced with a suggestively predatory physical suppleness, and he slips through the movie like a panther. He's the film's most deluxe item.The movie wants to be an instant Sidney Lumet classic along the lines of \"Serpico\" or \"Prince of the City,\" but it doesn't have the roots. It's new money.Arbitrage as a title may confound audiences, but maybe that's the point. An inner circle shop talk, insider trading manipulation of money, this Wall Street Noir intimates a secretive financial world from which most of us are excluded and manipulated.\"Arbitrage\" is a mirror on the audience, making us realize that we're complicit, if only vicariously, in some crimes which we ought to deplore.Slick and suspenseful ...Juicy, smart, engrossing financial thriller boasts assets aplenty in its portfolio.Gere's very good at making Robert's compromises seem more human than horrid. He portrays the philanthropic, philandering patriarch with his customary twinkle.Tense, taut, suspenseful, and Richard Gere is fabulous.First-time writer and director Nicholas Jarecki has given Gere a juicy, complex character in billionaire financier Robert Miller, and he just runs with it.Gere makes Robert's amorality appealing, which in itself conveys Jarecki's message about the seductive nature of Wall Street corruption.Gere's performance never takes the obvious route, but instead parries with self-delusion, noble instincts, and the moxie that made Miller what he is in every senseAny cinema venture featuring Richard Gere and Susan Sarandon is sufficient reason to invest a couple of hours.The best part of Gere's overall \"je ne sais quoi\" is the fact that the man can act.This isn't a film that invites you to identify with its leading character ...Competent, glossy thriller gussies up the familiar and articulately updates to the new Gilded Age. . . but with uncomfortable sympathy for the man at the pinnacle of the 1%.[VIDEO ESSAY] Republicans will love this movie. It will make everyone else want to hiss.If the film covers well-tread territory (a morally bankrupt player trying to prolong his own influence), it does so with pinpoint control of mood and theme.Jarecki's film has a great performance at its center...Enough of all this whining about the millions of regular people ruined by the financial collapse of 2007 - how about a movie sympathizing with one of the unfortunate guys responsible?First time feature film director-writer Nicolas Jarecki gives us an assured debut and a film that is more than a calling card, it is a full-blown introduction to a career that can only get better and better.Sex, wealth, paternal swagger-all of the colors come out of Gere in a showstopping performance.Gere is so charming, so irresistible when he's on top of the world - when he's got all those plates humming in unison - that he kind of makes you root for his character to get away with it all.Nicholas Jarecki's screenplay may remind you of one of those paperback thrillers people devour, but his savvy direction and Richard Gere's best performance in years make the movie as a whole wonderfully satisfying entertainment.Richard Gere, always reliable but underestimated actor, gives one of his strongest, most dominant performances in Jarecki's taut thriller, one that should finally garner him Oscar nomination.Arbitrage is a classy soap opera with a charismatic louse at its center, without Margin Call didactics, or the misplaced empathy of The Company Men.... It's simply good trash. You get the feeling that J.R. Ewing would approve.You will learn more about arbitrage from this review than you will from ARBITRAGE.A tight thriller that shows [its] handsome star in fine form as a morally bankrupt financier playing fast and loose with ethics and the law.A well-cast Richard Gere is terrific as shady hedge-fund magnate Robert Miller.He simply evades and bargains. It's tough to say what audiences are supposed to do with that.A walk down the seamy side of Wall Street is pulled out of the shredder by Gere's performance, but only barely.A tense, well-acted debut from Nicholas JareckiJarecki's feature debut is handsome and assured, with flashes of insight and the pleasures of a decent procedural. Given the brains and talent invested in it, however, Arbitrage should've yielded greater dividends.When it's over, you feel the same chill as its characters, pondering the cold, thin line that slices like a razor between striking it rich and losing it all.This terrific, character-driven New York story about big money, bigger liars, high finance and low, low morals is the best of the recent rush of fine films inspired by the GFC.It's a juicy narrative that will keep you interested but it does feel a little staged.For this story to work, writer/director Nicholas Jarecki had to include enough back doors to fill the scare floor at Monsters Inc. for a week.In the end, the moralism of \"Arbitrage\" feels glued-on rather than earned.Gere has always excelled at portraying smooth, elegant men who know a little more than everyone else in the room. But in Arbitrage he's playing a different note: Desperation.Basically a high-toned soap opera, the lick but shallow movie is entertaining enough on a lowbrow level.An ethically revealing film about a New York billionaire who's a member of the winning-class.Gripping and provocative..doesn't go quite where you expect. It may not be as sharp-edged as Margin Call, but it comes close.The depiction of money as the ultimate motivator should inspire most viewers to mutter, 'What else is new?'Gere's best shot at an Oscar?I enjoyed it, even as I hustled here and there to keep up with its Wall Street argot. The writing's juicy and effective, and the actors have fun with it.Hitchcock called his most familiar subject \"The Innocent Man Wrongly Accused.\" Jarecki pumps up the pressure here by giving us a Guilty Man Accurately Accused, and that's what makes the film so ingeniously involving.... a tightly written, sharply acted melodrama with a Tiffany gleam.Writer/director Nicholas Jarecki makes his feature debut with this refreshing movie, a combination of intelligent, grown-up writing and entertaining, audience-pleasing filmmaking.Part thriller, part character study, and it moves swiftly and confidently, with many details that feel exactly right.A muddled tale of a corporate high-flying huckster brought low.A ripping tale of high finance and low ethics, Arbitrage keeps its stocks continually on the rise due to a genuinely brilliant lead performance from the much-maligned Gere.Gere gets the role he has been suiting up for ever since he was first designer-dressed for a murder rap in American Gigolo.All of the characters are pretty darn unlikable. But when they're played by such a capable cast in such a tightly constructed story, you may not mind so much.Richard Gere is in top form in this smart, layered and thrilling financial drama.His moral guidelines are just as complicated and self contradictory as our ownAided by one of Gere's better performances, rookie Nicholas Jarecki directs with an acute perception of pace which makes this film exceptional.Nothing about the plot is novel, but the film easily maintains a low simmer that picks up in the final act, as Miller has to fight to keep his sinking ship staffed.Financial crime can be difficult to follow and dull to relate ... But Nicholas Jarecki keeps the paper stuff straightforward and the action interesting by bolting it on to a more conventional thriller plot.Not a huge amount happens, though suspense does eventually build.This may be the role that Gere has been suited for since he first threw on the Armani for American Gigolo.Gere's charm offsets his character's amorality in what's both slick entertainment and cautionary fable.Ethically driven storytelling at its best with an outstanding Richard Gere delivering one of his best performances.It's the kind of role that fits Gere perfectly these days, his somewhat blank face gradually hardening to the audience as we become increasingly aware of the moral void under the surface.With his burrowed eyes, perfect hair and flawless wardrobe, Gere brims with a regal air and unsettling chilliness in his best role in more than a decade.Gere doesn't give Robert a remarkable amount of depth, but he certainly plays his damaged, agonized soul for all it's worth, even as the movie views him from a coolly removed distance.There are holes in the plot, to be sure, but somehow we don't mind, because for all the unbearable tension of Jarecki's script, the central attraction here is the man in the arena.It's appropriate that Arbitrage gets its American release while our country is knee-deep in the fight over the fiscal cliff and the future of our financial institutions.",

        "document": "A terrific, no-budget picture teeming with guffaws, but it could've gone a lot further. I sincerely hope there are more Tucker and Dale adventures to come. Horror needs their blissful Southern-fried bewilderment.An allegory of our times, with a belabored message of tolerance punctuated by impalings and other grisly deaths.Tucker & Dale vs. Evil is a Canadian-made horror spoof that delivers both comedy and gross-out thrills.A long overdue rebuke to genre laziness and Hollywood snobbery.While its subversion of the well-worn \"hillbilly horror\" genre may be a one-note gag, that note is played pretty durn well. A clever, bloody, and unexpectedly sweet romp.What I responded to was the cleverness of the parody, which far exceeds a one-joke idea, its expert execution (especially for a first-time feature-film director) and the wonderful performances of its two leading actors, Alan Tudyk and Tyler Labine.If it doesn't quite go the distance, 'Tucker & Dale Vs. Evil' earns enough laughs along the way that it should be an amusing ride--especially for fans of slasher flicks (or those who have always thought the genre was totally ridiculous).It's a sometimes-hilarious send-up of slasher movies that buries a surprising amount of sweetness under buckets of gore.The deaths are inventively splatterific, the one-liners hit often enough, and Labine and Tudyk make for an engaging and likeable team.Tucker & Dale Vs. Evil is too slick and too cute; Tudyk and Labine are terrific comic actors, but the movie might've been better served by less-recognizable faces.At its heart, it's really just a one-idea premise stretched out to feature length, but the lovable duo of Tudyk and Labine and an endearing layer of sweetness under all the blood make it a fully enjoyable comedy of (t)errors.It's time we all toss our nine bucks into the proverbial woodchipper (don't ask me what proverb) and spit out enough money to make Tucker & Dale and other truly deserving, truly funny indie flicks a blazing success.This is a horror comedy designed to tickle horror fans who have grown frustrated with the often predictable formula of the genre they love.Pass the pickled eggs. It's 'Hee-Haw' meets 'Friday the 13th.'Gently subversive and disarmingly good-natured ...Its closest cousin is probably Shaun of the Dead, though shades of the Evil Dead series crop up as well. That's fine company to keep, and I'm happy to report that Tucker & Dale vs. Evil ultimately earns it.Students of the Little Movie Glossary may find it funny how carefully \"Tucker and Dale\" works its way through upended cliches.One of the more enjoyable horror-comedies to come along since the original Scream.a mordant comedy of errors that juggles the clich\u00e9s of its genre with a buoyant impudence. And blood. A whole lot of blood.Without a doubt the funniest movie of the year.Uses its reversal of the standard roles in rural horror to fantastic comedic effect.It's not as clever as, say, \"Shaun of the Dead,\" but it's good for some laughs.We see a script and some underexposed actors who were lucky to find each other.Essentially a student film offering nothing but absurdly contrived coincidence.There's even a message under all the body parts: People are individuals, not just easy regional stereotypes.The movie takes this idea and runs all the way with it, allowing audiences to catch on at their own pace.It's an easy crowd pleaser with its humor, heart and guts.This is one of those rare genre comedies that near-perfectly balances its blend of grue, guffaws, and gag reflexes.From the very first moment we understand where Tucker & Dale vs. Evil is going, the smiling startsWhile it's not quite a home run, there's a lot to enjoy about Tucker & Dale vs. Evil. It's got its heart in the right place, and hey, it's just nice to root for the hillbillies for once in this scenario!A razor-sharp homage fueled by a clever script and hilarious performances from its stars.If this isn't one of the funniest horror pics ever made, I've got to get out more often.a hilarious comedy of errors, and a savvy inside-out reconstruction of [an] all-too-familiar subgenre.Tucker and Dale vs Evil, much like the titular characters, is daft and doesn't much care for subtlety, but smart horror fans will laugh their way through this well-acted, subversive horror-comedy.Tucker and Dale has no ambitions beyond entertaining; luckily it's pretty good at it.Craig and co-screenwriter Morgan Jurgenson reverse the menace in their hilarious deconstruction of the genre.Has way more than the average serving of laughs out loud, and even has a few of those laughs that go on and on, that hurt your gut.Tucker and Dale isn't a spoof of the genre it's parodying (in this case, hillbilly slasher movies like Wrong Turn), but rather a razor-sharp homage fueled by a clever script and hilarious performances from its stars.Surprise, it works.Tudyk and Labine work so well together in this that I hope there's a sequel.Great hillbilly horror comedy!Eli Craig's feature debut celebrates genre conventions while turning the traditional view of horror-movie heroes and villains upside down.T&D offers good-natured, confidently executed splatstick whose frequent hilarity suffers only from peaking too early.The gore is epic and the self-destruction all the funnier when it appears inevitable.Typical expectations are upended in the horror-comedy Tucker & Dale vs. Evil, Eli Craig's feature directorial debut and an endearingly cheeky tribute to suspense and slasher classics.There's nothing wrong with a one-joke horror/comedy -- provided you keep the joke spinning for 90 minutes. This flick (somehow) does.Take note, those of you in Hollywood making awful satire. There is a right way to send up a genre, and this is it.Genuinely brilliant.Film fans who believe there's no way they could ever cheer for rednecks (a lifetime of Deliverance and The Texas Chain Saw Massacre will do that to a person) will sheepishly smirk as they find themselves rooting for the rubes holding center stage here.Just about as rip-roarin' a horror comedy as we've seen in a while.Clever horror/comedy hybrid of the kind that Sam Raimi used to make and that so many have tried to produce in recent years but have fallen remarkably flat. There's nothing flat about this clever genre flick. For the right audience, it's pretty great.This goofy, over-the-top tale of college students on a camping trip warring with two local West Virginia hillbillies lacks a core identity.Silly one-joke spoof horror/comedy about rednecks and college students together in the woods.Beginning psychologists take note - hillbillies and college kids may kill each other, but the greatest assets in maintaining the peace, on both sides, are hot coeds.Oh, dear. Oh, my. Oh, goody. This is one of the funniest things I have ever seen, a clever, witty, surprising splatter comedy to rank with Evil Dead II and Shaun of the Dead...The timing is impeccable, the gags are wonderfully tasteless.The final acts of Tucker and Dale vs Evil find the movie falling into the trap of using the same conventions ... it so jovially and brutally skewers prior.Strikes an enjoyable tone of congenial gore.It's neither particularly funny in its desperate rural dumbness, nor is it much of a genre piss-take.... deft/daft mix of authentic feeling and sharp parody, belly laughs and visceral dread, makes Tucker & Dale vs. Evil a keeper...\"Evil\" fails to triumph. Utterly.A salutary, very funny and pleasingly moral movie.This subversion of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Wrong Turn tropes is reasonably clever and delivered with requisite tongue in cheek.A neat reversal of the kids-in-the-wood genre that's genuinely funny - and quite bloody as it turns out.Make no mistake, \"Tucker & Dale vs. Evil\" is a total lark, yet it's also very clever. Real thought and ingenuity were brought to its making, and it shows.As with most single-joke movies the plot runs out of steam, but it's still a fun and memorable ride.Topsy-turvy hoot delivering a grim and confident fiasco full of clever contradictions and a couple of likeable champions of the hour in Tucker and DaleBy the time the action-packed, thoroughly tedious climax rolls around, Tucker and Dale Vs. Evil has established itself as a missed opportunity of disappointingly epic proportions...I doubt that anyone who isn't well familiar with slasher movie tropes will completely understand all the jokes... but they should at least get a couple laughs out of it.If you've seen your share of teenagers getting sliced and diced out in the boondocks, chances are you'll be tickled pink by this tale of a couple of good-natured bumpkins who are mistaken for serial murderers.Beats a dead horse all the way to the glue factory.Everyone seems to be having a jolly good time, though I'm still not sure what they're satirizing.Although attitude is more important than plot in spoofs like this, Tucker & Dale's storyline does have the right sort of momentum.There is nothing very deep about this movie, but it is surprisingly funny for a slasher film.Tucker and Dale vs Evil is deliciously fun satire -- and, once all the blood has been spilt, offers an interesting riff on the line between hero and horror villain.Here's something you don't see every day: a genial, politically correct splatter comedy.... a far-fetched but bloody fun film that doesn't talk down to its target audience so much as it celebrates fans of the genre.An instant cult smash, get Tucker & Dale facing against the Wolfman, Bubba Hotep or Alien (or Predator) immediately.Tucker & Dale vs Evil feels as if it knows exactly what it wants to be - a throwaway Friday night horror film with enough laughs to balance the gore.Smartly directed, brilliantly written and featuring a pair of terrific comic performances from its two leads, this is a thoroughly enjoyable comedy-horror that's laugh-out-loud funny from start to finish.It's a good joke, but one that inevitably flags over 90 minutes.Genre staples and stereotypes are slain only for convention to wreak revenge; but it'd sure be sweet to follow the loveable lugs on another misadventure.Co-writer/director Eli Craig deconstructs nearly every slasher horror movie clich\u00e9 dating back to \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" for a gross-out laugh fest that works better than it has any right to.Who couldn't love a man who awkwardly approaches a girl, hoping to strike up a conversation, with a scythe in his hand? How can a guy who washes his wounds with beer not be endearing?Genuinely funny. A life lesson in never prejudging a man just because he's skinning a squirrel.It's a rare treat: a horror/comedy with heart and style.Despite its crowd-pleasing nature, Tucker & Dale remains overly broad and one-note throughoutHillbillies of the world unite!If you're seeing this as the midnight movie it's destined to best be experienced as, you could safely drift off after the 45-minute mark...A farce of misunderstanding first, body-count nightmare second and at nearly all times a refreshingly upending horror-comedy bromance.a hillbilly Ren & StimpyIt's fast, it's funny, and it works.Few things are more annoying than a movie that doesn't stick to its over-the-top convictions.Relying mostly on a single gimmick, the slasher comedy presents a high degree of difficulty for both the director and actors. Their earnest efforts keep the repetition from becoming ponderous....while the film's yucks are mixed with R-rated gore, the movie eventually runs out of steam, its themes not explored and satirized quite as well as they could have been.It thrives on Tucker and Dale's winning personalities, and the chemistry so evident in the shrewd coupling of Tudyk and Labine, veteran performers who rarely enjoy top billing but make the most of it here.A droll sendup of the killer-in-the-swamp genre that gets funnier as it rolls along.",

        "document": "Although the movie never quite dispels the sense of being dated (it could have been made anytime in the past 40 years), it's a memorable, often moving timepiece.The fey illogic in the title of My Brother is an Only Child hints at the style of this funny-sad film, which flips from dark to light moods and back with suave, unpredictable dexterity.Though it's well-cast and convincingly captures the look and feel of its era, the film loses steam as Accio's story meanders to a predictable conclusion.Director Daniele Luchetti's strategy is to personify the long-standing divisions of his homeland in a pair of siblings, but make the characters so vital that we don't feel we're being browbeaten with political allegory.This smart, engaging film shows how much political convictions are often rooted in the inchoate passions and early disappointments of youth.In a sense, the movie is about Accio's appreciation of the practical limits of ideology and the practical uses of rebellion, and it's a poignant realization.The rough-and-tumble tone is bitterly entertaining but in the end doesn't contribute to a convincing historical portrait, and a pileup of half-baked resolutions spoils the buzz.Tells a familiar story in a familiar way with conviction and no small amount of talent on both sides of the camera, though it's hardly essential.One hardly needs to have grown up Italian in the '60s to feel a pang of nostalgia watching My Brother Is an Only Child, Daniele Luchetti's tale of small-town brothers.The film's biggest failure isn't Accio's constant contentiousness, nor the story's dense political center. Rather, it's the script's tendency to wander.Despite its charged historical backdrop, [director] Luchetti keeps My Brother light and snappy without sacrificing narrative tension.[Director] Luchetti understands that the soul of Italy is found in its disparate people -- its brothers -- and particularly in its cinema tradition. Luchetti strides in the footpath of giants.If the political backdrop is not alienating, Accio's actions might be. As he swings from one side of the pendulum to the other, he remains at arm's lengthMy Brother Is an Only Child is a politically charged family drama set in Italy in the 1960s and 1970s -- think The Best of Youth (director Daniele Luchetti collaborated with that epic film's writers) at a more butt-friendly running time.[Actor] Elio Germano vitalizes the film: He's hyper-reactive, flickering between brash, bashful, playful, and awkward -- offering a Swiss Army knife performance that's diverse and yet totally unified.A spunky, memorable, and emotionally touching Italian film about the quest for personal transformation through politics.It is almost a relief to find some ideological clarity in a film that unfortunately ends in complete political disillusionment on all sides.Luchetti's craftsmanship is evident in the movie's fluid on-location cinematography, excellent production design, and its wonderful period score.What makes My Brother Is an Only Child so alive and entertaining is how it dramatizes the endless tug-of-war between political conviction and personal experience -- the way the lines twist and blur and finally implode.My Brother Is an Only Child moves so playfully and briskly you may not notice its glibness, which may have been director Daniele Luchetti's intent.Yep, it's your typical shouty Italian movie, though this time presented with sharp humor and an effortless cinematic verity by director Daniele Luchetti.Fast-paced, well-acted and acute about sibling rivalry, the film nonetheless fails to leave a strong impression.It's an engrossing political love story, with a strong sense of the shadings within the daily lives of these characters.The performances are astonishing, perhaps enabled by the flawless script.This is such a lovely film from writer/director Daniele Luchetti, nostalgic perhaps, but with that indefinable Italian whimsy that takes serious political themes and undermines them beautifully.Daniele Luchetti's fluent, heartfelt Italian picture is the story of two brothers born after the war, who come of age in the 1960s and drift apart in the paranoid, violent, sour political atmosphere of Italy in the 70s.Actors Germano and Scamarcio turn in magnificent, multilayered acting jobs.A merry swirl of vital, passionate performances.The film, which argues that blood brotherhood is stronger than political brotherhoods, vibrates with their youthful energy and ardor.\"Only Child\" is both funny and heartbreaking, and incredibly adept at shifting between lighter and darker tones.Despite the awards pedigree, the drama is a bit of a slog at times, with Accio taking seemingly ages to come of age, but nobody said growing up was easy.The linkage in this movie between politics and family dynamics is a point well taken, but the movie -- whose sense of frenetic activity going nowhere is captured by Luchetti's buoyant camera -- does go on and on before anyone learns anything.Although familiarity with Italian politics helps in appreciating this film, anyone can enjoy this energetic tale of a house divided.My Brother Is an Only Child is a lively minor addendum to the grand tradition of Italian fraternal cinema.The best thing about the movie are the performances, all of which are outstanding; in particular, Angela Finocchiaro, who plays the long-suffering mother, is superb.My Brother Is an Only Child is a buoyant, handsomely crafted film.The film's early affability eventually wears out, and a sharp turn into deadly seriousness feels out of place.You don't need a degree in political science to love this film...The film entertainingly demonstrates that the bonds of blood are stronger than those of ideology.A coming-of-age story about a young man who - like the era he was born into - has no idea how to come of age, except by violent fits and starts, in all directions, to varying ends, and ready to change course whenever the mood strikes.Surprisingly funny, good-looking and a true showcase for the talents of rising star Elio Germano.That it clicks is largely due to the daredevil chemistry of the actors playing the brothers, who can be a handful whenever they're together.manages to evoke, but never trivialise, the mad, internecine conflicts of recent Italian political historyIt's vibrantly shot throughout, with the handheld camerawork well suited to conveying Accio's impulsive behaviour.Sometimes, under a torrent of social pressures, water runs faster, if not thicker, than blood, and even the strongest bonds drown in the flood.Made in the tradition of Italian films documenting the effects of shifting political contexts on personal and family lives, Luchetti's intelligent work at once pays homage to and belongs to seminal films by Bertolucci (Before the Revolution) and BellochioLuchetti directs with a light touch that recalls the Italian comedies that were popular -- in the U.S. as well as Europe -- during the period it portrays.Engaging, sharply directed drama with a strong script and superb performances, though you occasionally feel you're missing out on a deeper meaning.works best as an Italian dramedy with its history used as window dressing and any original thought kept happily to itself.A handsomely-made, brightly charming pleasure.A fine and engaging study of two personalities, seemingly in sharp contrast, that prove awfully alike in the end.Handsomely shot and astutely cast, My Brother Is an Only Child should achieve the same attention and success accorded to The Best of Youth, whose scriptwriters worked with Luchetti on this one.If some of this sounds like stereotypical Italian behavior, and if in fact My Brother Is an Only Child has a weakness for abrupt and melodramatic plot devices, it has other virtues that make it truly satisfying.In this lively drama of rebellion and revolution, emotion is even more inflammatory than politics.Politics takes a back seat in a jaunty comedy of a pair of brothers, one Communist and one Fascist, who come to a fraternal understanding too late.My Brother Is An Only Child reminisces with improbable yet affecting fondness over the adolescents behind the -isms that would shape post-war Italy.Helmer Daniele Luchetti keeps the mood light and winning.Thanks to the captivating performances, this is well worth checking out.",

I don't care, and neither should you.Between this and I Am Sam, someone should call protective services on behalf of young Fanning.(Brittany Murphy)is capable of so much more than becoming another Reese Witherspoon, wasting her talents for a fat paycheck.The movie turns Fanning into a line-spewing automaton rather than a real human being....obvious, pandering, prat-falling silliness that gets about a 20% return on its talent investmentAn utterly vacuous bit of fluff...one of those clumsy concoctions in which every element rings false and all the seams show.Or maybe the film is so fun because we actually get to see Dakota Fanning slap the living **** out of Brittany Murphy at Coney Island.It may be junk food with high sugar levels, but the inspired teaming of rising young actress Brittany Murphy and precocious tot Dakota Fanning makes you forget those hazardous sweeteners.the audience is left with nothing else to do but give a collective yawn of impatient indifferenceI'm a fan of both Murphy and Fanning; but this film might be one they'll leave off their resumes.Yakin shuns caricature. His affection for all his feckless characters, even Fanning's narcissistic mom (Heather Locklear), is evident.Combine two mannered performances with a script intent on achieving maximum cuteness, and you've got one wince-inducing sugar rush.Like an evil, terrifying version of The Odd Couple.Can two over-pampered but fundamentally lonely persons of the blonde female persuasion bond meaningfully with each other while shopping?The ending is so forced that it betrays the movie's potential.In truth, this isn't nearly as bad as it sounds. Fanning is really good and Murphy gives as good as she gets.If you're a fan of treacly, superficial stories about completely unlikable people forming friendships, or if you like pratfalls, then this is the movie for you.While the movie hits on a bunch of emotional topics, the dialogue veers into the mawkish far more than necessary.Though I found Mr. Yakin's direction unexpectedly imaginative, and the script often incongruously subtle, I couldn't get into the spirit of all the whimsy, the reason being the surprising lack of charm in the two leads.It is a confusing experience-a film unsure of what it wants to beMurphy hasn't adjusted her expressions to her newly emaciated appearance, which makes her attempts to be twinkly and adorable a little grotesque.Contrived and amateurish.[A] horribly misguided movie.A consistently strained effort.It's possible that Uptown Girls will supplant Gigli as the summer's biggest joke.[An] ungainly Manhattan fairy tale.A colorful, creative, deliciously frolicsome romp.It'll take more than a spoonful of sugar to make this medicine go down.[A] comedy with no laughs.The screenplay is by the numbers.An embarrassingly silly exercise that mostly serves as a platform for Brittany Murphy to model a fab wardrobe and glam hairstyles.A light, occasionally charming and reasonably well-crafted tale about a transforming female friendship.The film is close to a disaster in its remarkably rigid formula.Uptown Girls lacks the urban specificity that helped to make The World of Henry Orient such an uptown-girl classic, but it works up a sentimental tug that should moisten the eyes of many a moppet and mom.It's really just a pastiche of scenes, most which aren't interesting.A collection of cliches and test screening results, put together in no particular order.Uptown Girls is supposed to be funny and emotionally wrenching, and the film certainly is, but for all the wrong reasons.For a comedy, it's surprisingly laugh-free and for an oh-so-message-laden tale of spoiled-gal redemption, it's irritatingly sincerity-free.[A] standard variation of the princess myth.When Uptown Girls is released on DVD, its commentary tracks should consist of a single looped phrase: 'We're truly sorry.'There's nothing wrong with Uptown Girls that not seeing it won't fix.Murphy's performance has a kind of ineffable mischievous innocence about it.So shiny and sweet, it's too bad director Boaz Yakin couldn't squeeze more originality into it.Haphazardly slapped together without an original bone in its anorexic frame.Yakin and the great cinematographer Michael Ballhaus give the afternoon such a primal, heartbreaking sadness that you feel like you're watching Lillian Gish in a D.W. Griffith melodrama.It's all too, too cute and too, too forced for words.Brittany Murphy...once again flashing come-hither lips, hair, legs and everything else when her dark eyes would do just fine.Director Boaz Yakin ... keeps shying from the darker material like a studio-trained racehorse, heading for the safer turf of slapstick and schmaltz.What Uptown Girls amounts to is two creeps yelling at each other for 90 minutes.Takes an extremely obvious comic situation ... and misses the easy laughs by miles.This alleged comedy is so tedious that it feels twice its rather slight length.Fanning's black rage caused by the very unfunny matters of parental neglect and the impending death of a loved one grates against the film's driving purpose as lightweight fare.A creepy, depressing and leering 'comedy' that's a virtual collection of 'What were they thinking?' moments.Like a linty old sour ball. It starts off a bit gritty and leaves a sickeningly sweet aftertaste.If you own a statuette that declares, 'I wuv you THIS much,' you're the target audience for this sickeningly sweet girl-power pic.Not an especially raucous comedy, but it is an unfunny, rhythmless one.Though Murphy is radiant, and her laughs are infectious, her free-spiritedness is thrust in our face like a pointy object in a 3-D movie.When Uptown Girls isn't trying to play up its wacky high jinks ... it stoops to the kind of psychological character development films this shallow should really avoid like the plague.About a young woman who goes to work for and eventually befriends the most obnoxious child ever to exist on this planet.In the end, it's 'Moo' the pig, that comes off looking the best here.horribly misguided'El resultado es bastante mediocre, pues la cinta es bastante predecible y francamente aburrida'...an incredibly formulaic setup that would be more at home in a made-for-TV movie starring Patricia Heaton and that little girl from Seventh Heaven.Whether you buy Uptown Girls or not will depend on whether you're willing to go along with its utterly contrived and formulaic plot.The sheer charisma of the performances - from a screwball Murphy and a caustic Fanning - manages to float a sentimental script that frequently fizzes where it should pop.A lame, predictable comedy.Fanning practically dares the audience to throw sharp objects at the screen with her thoroughly obnoxious performance.Brought down with emotional manipulation, melodrama, and just a bi-polar mood.What communicative compromise is there [for Yakin] to go from personal, gritty and well-made films, to such a vapid commercial plea?Brittany Murphy and Dakota Fanning can't rise above a weak script in this riches-to-rags tale; \"Uptown\" is low-rent.Absent any sort of support from the screenplay, Murphy and Fanning are forced to engage in a cute-a-thon.A saccharine and shamelessly manipulative piece of fluff.Everything has a blurry, much-edited quality, and the story lines don't mesh.You can snicker and enjoy all at once.It's excruciating, a film of forced humor and fake, grating sentimentality, featuring two lead performances that elicit neither affection nor empathy.There's more than a hint of desperation to Murphy's characterization.The turn from frothy comedy to offputting pathos would be a jarring tone shift, if the movie had any consistent tone at the outset.Brittany Murphy pulls off a few slapstick sight gags here, but nothing to compare with her hilarious pratfalls in 'Just Married.'Unfortunately, the emotionally resonant moments between Murphy and Fanning are few and far between.Brittany Murphy's flighty, foolish trust-fund princess in Manhattan vies for the honor of the most annoying screen character of the year.You're going to forget this one as soon as you finish watching. And if you don't, it will probably be because you want to complain about how uninspired and unoriginal it is.Entirely unoriginal and unbelievably predictable, but director Boaz Yakin knows how to create Kodak moments for the crowd that desires such fare.A weird, unsuccessful and by all accounts unreasoned blend of styles [that] seems shot and edited together by two entirely different people.... a disaster.Cute little girl playing dress-up (and Dakota wasn't bad either) - this may not be classic cinema, but it fits nicely into the guilty pleasure category.A modern fairytale that loads up big-time on the girly trappings but doesn't give you much in the way of plot or characters or even plain old sense.None of it is handled with any emotional believability or grace.The sort of film that shuffles along sleepily, dazedly, barely aware of what it's doing and hardly caring whether the audience is still following it or not.Brittany Murphy and Dakota Fanning make for a winning combination, and their characters' sometimes dark journeys do not always take the most obvious route to the inevitable happy ending.The film has a weird foot fetish. The part where she was barefoot on the city streets actually grossed me out. Now she's going to put those feet in her bed with all the city dirt all over them. Ewww.Before you waste any money, let me remind you that bad movies do happen. Even Uptown.Locates Fanning's 'maturity' in a fear of germs that comes off as borderline psychotic, and Murphy's childlike free spirit in her apparent inability to avoid walking into walls.Several decent movies are screaming to get out of \"Uptown Girls.\"Worth going Uptown for.A reworking of What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? with Fanning in the Davis role and, say, Emily Osment in the Crawford one might be a smart bet for some forward-thinking producer.Gives chick flicks a bad name.This is one sad, dull film.Murphy creates a rather fascinating chemistry with Fanning, who resolutely absconds with the film as a controlling tot from hell, a fun-killing spinster trapped in a prepubescent body.Brittany Murphy is top billed, but nine-year-old Dakota Fanning almost makes the cloying, predictable film interesting.You can feel the screenwriters run out of ideas early on.",

Milestone, Abbott and Anderson in this film have contributed a memorable piece of work to the screen.A gripping, disturbing, emotionally affecting movie about the loss of innocence and idealism.One of the most effective pacifist arguments ever committed to celluloid. It is a torturous vision of death devoid of glory.The horrific immediacy of the battle scenes remains unsurpassed and even though the discussions on the purposes, causes and effects of war now seem laboured and stagy, they still have power and cogency.Classic anti-war dramaA Classic and then someClassic early talkie is still anti-war effective.Heavy stuff, especially for 1930.The film's strength now derives less from its admittedly powerful but highly simplistic utterances about war as waste, than from a generally excellent set of performances (Ayres especially) and an almost total reluctance to follow normal plot structure.A film that remains one of the most powerful screen comments on the horrors of war.A harrowing, gruesome, morbid tale of war.From such grisly materials the popular cinema is rarely drawn. The film is monumental in the courage that risked its manufacture.Despite a little dating around the edges this is a truly superb example of its genre and a cinema classic....a bitter indictment of the insulated powers that induce naive young men to kill one another.An ambitious epic of tremendous sweep and scope.Deserves its reputation as a classic.The film made Ayres a star.All Quiet on the Western Front is the definitive World War I motion picture, the best of a surprisingly small class of movies.This uncompromising drama makes a bleak statement of war fighting in trenches, stressing the inanity of WWI (or any war) for both sides; perhaps the most memorable moment is the one in which Lew Ayres reaches out for a butterfly to disastrous effect.There are few war films that can match the brilliance of Lewis Milestone's anti-war classic. It's a feast for the ears with a passionate soul.One of the great war-is-folly epics.Perhaps the greatest antiwar film ever made.All Quiet on the Western Front (1930) is the first major anti-war film of the sound era, faithfully based upon the timeless 1929 novel by Erich Maria Remarque.With no focus on one or even a handful of characters, Quiet is strangely uninvolving until it begins to concentrate on young Paul Baumer.Took an opportunity to question warfare and its civility long before the war protest film became popular in the 70s. It's dated, obviously, but still powerful.A movie of timeless relevance and effects. Lew Ayres would never again equal his performance in this film version of the well-known anti-war novel.The performances are haunting.So magnificent, so powerful, that it hardly behooves mere words to tell of its heart-rending appeal, of its dramatic fire, its breath-taking battle shots in which men stab and kill each other, for the glory of war.It not only seeks to straddle the high dramatic of the silent era with the more staid aesthetics of the sound era, but it seeks to reveal wartime horror to such a heart-wrenching degree that it will undo war altogether.The performances are also exemplary, but it is primarily a film of great moments -- the climactic sequence of the young conscript reaching out for a butterfly in the sun -- that, once seen, are never forgotten.The production values are incredibly high and not just for the time. And as the movie has aged and the film has gone grainier and the flickers increased, it almost adds to the effect.[A] fascinating, innovative early talkie.The rawness of the audio eradicates any lingering notion that war is romantic or exciting, and at times suggests the very battered eardrums of those engaged in combat.The despair-and the artistry-is breathtaking.",

But it's sad to see their excellence revisited in such a mediocre movie.Invaluable proof that nothing can save a hackneyed screenplayCaptures all the excitement of U.S. hockey win.The best sports movie I've ever seen.It's not too hokey, not politically correct, not a mass of chewy, Disney-fried steak, not even a miracle -- it's just good storytelling.[It takes] a wonderful story and transforms it into by-the-numbers entertainment that doesn't show us anything new about hockey or this historic event.While I don't like the way it simplifies history, I have to admit that Miracle is a hugely effective crowd-pleaser.Believe in the greatness of Kurt Russell.Esquem\u00e1tico em toda a narrativa, \u00e9 apenas mais um exemplo inferior do g\u0119nero \"azar\u0103o-com-esp\u00edrito-de-vencedor\".Don't look for surprises here, but know that the story of the 1980 triumph again earns respect and should quicken the pulse of a new generation of filmgoers who are ready for some inspiration on ice.A stirring sports drama.A fitting tribute to Brooks.A manipulative feel-good sports movie but we challenge you to hold the cheers back during the movie's cool finale.The climax, a 20-minute dramatization of the crucial contest, lacks both suspense and poetry -- essentially, we're left to watch a clumsy recreation of a game whose outcome we already know.A worthy ride, especially if you're into sports.A rousing good story of an underdog that galvanized a nation.You've got to hand it to director Gavin O'Connor and Disney, the same company that gave us The Mighty Ducks, for making a real hockey film this time around.Disney has another hit on their hands with \"Miracle\"... it's not suspenseful, but it's great entertainment.\"Miracle\" is the kind of inspirational film that will appeal, mostly, to the hockey fans but its crowd-pleasing nature should carry it beyond just the fans.Russell as Brooks is the year's first truly great performance, giving up nothing but what is necessary to convey the coach's legendary determination.There has never been as exciting a sports event filmed in the movies as there is on display in Miracle, and I'm including the fight in Rocky and the QB sack in RudyWe know all the cliches of the modern sports movie, but Miracle sidesteps a lot of them.An unexaggerated, heartfelt but not ham-fisted movie.Russell gives an assured, intelligent performance that anchors the film.A wonderful docudrama of an undiluted great moment.Kurt Russell is perfect as hockey coach Herb Brooks in a true story that still manages to be rousing and inspirational despite its inherent predictability.A complex portrait of a man, and Kurt Russell delivers a major performance as that man.Miracle capitalizes on its understanding of team dynamics: the bonding of pain and gain alike, the ownership of integrity over ego, the satisfaction of communal accomplishment. [Blu-ray]Even if you don't know a \"blue line from a clothes line,\" \"Miracle\" is a thoroughly enjoyable film that unspools like a Robert Altman movie where many characters' individual essences are revealed at once.A story about people rather than just one a team going for the win. In doing so, O'Connor makes Miracle one of the more thoughtful and enjoyable films revolving around sports.Moving story of the 1980 Olympic hockey team.This inspirational, rough and tumble, profanity-free testament to ingenuity also touches on the conflicts between work ethics and domestic responsibility.Writer Eric Guggenheim and director O'Connor master the two key elements: the team and Brooks.Russell is at his understated best in the film, which stands as a living tribute to Coach Herb Brooks.This isn't anyone's finest hour.The film has many great moments, but dare I say, it's not melodramatic enough.Like all great sports movies, 'Miracle' is less a study of a competitive contest than it is a character analysis. And ho-hum, another great performance by Kurt Russell.Director Gavin O'Connor has given us one of the greatest sports movies of all time and the best hockey movie this side of the comedic hockey masterpiece Slap Shot.The film is about the moment of victory, and what a beautiful moment it was.Although it struggles to reproduce the emotion of the moment, it emphatically reminds us that on one fateful Friday night, the impossible was possible.If Miracle weren't so passionate and finally affecting, it would be easy to dismiss its familiarity and overt jingosim as lazy screenwriting.Gavin O'Connor takes a potentially jingoistic movie and makes it into a challenging little politcal statement--hey, you get the *puck* out of Afghanistan!It\u2019s a great sports movie that recreates an amazing moment in sports history with no frills.I admit I know next to nothing about sports. And I loved \"Miracle.\"If you can tolerate all this phony uplift you'll also get a pretty interesting story about a shrewd Minnesota college coach named Herb Brooks.This is a historical movie obsessed with detail and the pure beauty of playing hockey.On the ice this film is Gold, but off the ice it is a manipulating mess.Kurt Russell's performance transcends the film's unilateral politics to achieve a viewer-conversant three dimensions.When a dedication to Brooks appeared at the film's end, the audience gave the coach a standing ovation -- too bad the rest of the film couldn't inspire them in the same way.In its exhilarating last act, we watch our team succeed at the impossible. Repeat after me, 'U S A, U S A, U S A.''Miracle' features some of the best on-ice hockey action ever put on film....what makes the film a cut above is its spectacular camera work and well paced and meticulous attention to detail.While the sundry tensions among players and, especially, between players and coach, provide a modicum of drama, none is pursued to the point of detail.I would like to have gotten to know some of the players a little bit better.Asking how it ends is like asking whether the boat sinks in Titanic. What makes Miracle special is its respect for every event that precedes the big game.Olympic hockey drama re-creates an unexpected victory and the blood, sweat, toil and tears that made it happen.That it's so warmly nostalgic and so damn exciting (especially when you consider that, hey, we already know who won that game) is a minor miracle in its own right.An almost joyless movie...The only miracle is that O'Connor has taken a magnificently unpredictable story and turned it into a predictable one.[T]humbs up for this uplifting and inspirational movie about one of the great upsets in sports history.Despite its been-there, done-that theme, Miracle stirs your emotions anyway...A basic, feel-good sports movie, but if you like that sort of thing, it isn't too badMiracle's most concrete achievement is in showing how, step by demanding step, Brooks was able to transform 20 young men used to playing as stellar individuals -- the American way -- into an unintimidate-able, egoless team, i.e., the Soviet way.An acceptably middlebrow drama that asks nothing more of its audience members than to cheer at the appropriate moments.a genre flick, the type usually found in a shorter format during a half-time show where swelling music and slo-mo substitute for genuine feelingMiracle is a blatant crowd pleaser, but there's no denying that it's often very effective.A marvelous film-- enthralling, ecstatic and an illustration of everything Seabiscuit did wrong.What will make the film compelling even for audiences who never heard of the miracle on ice is Kurt Russell's taut, nuanced portrait of Herb Brooks.Not all inspirational stories about sports should be made into movies.Has oodles of historical sentiment to work with but chooses to travel a conventional road.A major spring crowd-pleaser--'Seabiscuit' with pucks--but while the victory of Team USA in 1980 might have been miraculous, the movie reduces it to something pretty ordinary.Calculated, polished, and affectionate.This middle-of-the-road film missed a more interesting opportunity.Kurt Russell's performance ranks as one of the most compelling portraits of a coach ever committed to film.The hockey scenes, photographed by Dan Stoloff (\"Tumbleweeds\") look great.The puck-flying, stick-slapping, bodies-slamming-against-the-wall action couldn't be more intenseRussell is terrific as coach Herb Brooks.While not particularly ambitious as a human drama or character study, Disney's Miracle succeeds solidly at its main aim: stirringly recreating one of the great sports sagas of all time.This is an inspirational saga that transcends its sport.Miracle is authentic and classy, from its impeccably edited game re-creations to its washed-out, game-film look that's akin to what you'd see on ESPN Classic.Miracle puts audiences on the Olympic ice, sharing the once-in-a-lifetime action.A heartwarming tearjerker that'll melt even the staunchest anti-American.Miracle reveals in the dramatic story of the 1980 U.S. Olympic hockey team that giving oneself up to the Game is the highest calling in sports.Russell, perfectly cast, wears his character's 20 years of regret with supreme sadness.Could it be that Disney, the studio that holds the trademark on triteness, has developed a true flair for non-patronizing, fact-based feel-good sports movies?\"Miracle\" serves as a refreshing reminder that there are other kinds of patriotism besides the \"you're either with us or against us\" variety....one of those uplifting, patriotic movies you could get thrown in jail for disliking.A resonant exploration of that not-so-distant moment when the 1970s segued uneasily into the 1980s.An effective exercise in flag-waving nostalgia.The new Disney movie Miracle may blatantly manipulate your emotions -- but it's still inspirational and completely compelling.Inspirational and uplifting.If you like to inspire and be inspired -- to work hard for your dreams -- then you're likely to be charged up by this film.While this upset was unquestionably a great achievement, it's only a 'miracle' if it's accompanied by the image of the Blessed Virgin on the Zamboni, if you ask me.Miracle is a suitably rigorous sports movie. On the other hand, at no time does it break out of the sports movie mold.Powerful in its recreation of a magical time and place and it really does make us believe that miracles are possible.An accessible, meticulous, rousing tribute to the legendary game that should both please mainstream audiences and hold up to aficionado scrutiny.It's a solid, solidly entertaining film. But the entire enterprise is a bit too square, retro and harpingly on-message for its own good.On the simplest level, it's a true underdog story, told in an exciting way when it counts the most.Such is the power of patriotism, under-dog heroics and a movie that knows when to cue the inspiring music.Amicably gets the job done while never wavering far from its often cliched path.A Cinderella sports story you can't help but enjoy.Director Gavin O'Connor and writer Eric Guggenheim have come up with a simple, 'good for the whole family' masterpiece. This was not expected.Effective drama that asks little from the audience and returns pretty much what one would expect.Strangely disappointing because it only meets expectations, going faithfully by the sports-movie numbers.The first truly good movie of the year.A thrilling character study but only an average action flick.[A] sure-fire crowd-pleaser.Miracle boasts a batch of lively supporting characters, and the on-ice action is both fast and furious.The film is built on textbook cliches ... But each is delivered with such precision and professionalism, they become exhilarating.often feels like an endurance test, but there is no denying the uplifting nature of the eventEven for a Disney sports movie, this is a treacly affair, complete with an Armageddon-style hero shot that just screams manipulation.The film is destined to appeal to a niche audience, but that niche will come away very pleased.This is material tailor-made for audiences whose concept of intersocietal conflict is dictated by the Franklin Mint.Pretty standard inspirational fare.The movie brings the audience back to 1980 with bone-crunching verisimilitude.Hockey fans should enjoy the movie, as will fans of the underdog.If you like - or at least don't mind - ice hockey, then hang on for a great story, skilfully filmed.The movie effectively simulates the game's whirl, and should grab all but the most finicky hockey fans.

It captures all the excitement of one of the great sports stories of all time.A faithful retelling of the team's famous run for the gold.A better-than- average sports movie.Shamelessly manipulative but thoroughly enjoyable.Russell powers [the movie] along tautly.The movie's extended re-creation of the game is still thrilling and nerve-racking.Miracle gives audiences something to cheer for.Given that we know the outcome it's amazing how much suspense Miracle engenders.Never before has a sports movie taken so little care to ensure the audience understands the sport in question. That might sound like a negative, but it improves the film enormously for those who understand and love the game.Miracle offers everything a filmgoer could want from a sports movie.[The] story proves too perfect for even a ham-handed Hollywood movie like this one to screw upMiracle fails to ring true as it tries to make a sporting event an all-embracing metaphor for the American way.Obviously, there's no suspense about the outcome, but Miracle manages to hold the viewer's interest by skirting most sports-flick cliches and focusing on character development and detail.This is a classically well-made studio entertainment that, like The Rookie of a few years back, has the knack of being moving without shamelessly overdoing a sure thing.The miracle is making a sports movie that turns the usual cliches into something authentic.I don't know that I've ever felt more involved in fictional competition than I was throughout this movie, and I can't tell a hockey puck from cow pie.Long on cliche and short on originality.The spark itself can never be duplicated, but Miracle gets a lot closer than we might have hoped.The best sports movie since Tin Cup.It's a challenge to keep this familiar routine interesting, especially since we already know the ultimate outcome, but it's one this movie meets.A suspenseful, emotional experience even for those who don't study the sports pages.A by- the-numbers re-telling of what Sports Illustrated dubbed the single greatest sports moment of the 20th century.This movie version of the 1980 United States Olympic hockey team's Cinderella season does a yeoman's job of recycling the day-old dough that passes for its story.Even though we've been through these paces so many times before and there's never the slightest doubt of its outcome, Miracle is an extraordinarily exciting, absorbing and satisfying movie.The silver medal goes to Kurt Russell's fine performance as coach Herb Brooks....[a] gritty and grand feel-good sporting story.This is a serviceable hat trick that scores some vital goals in its high-spirited gumption.Miracle isn't a hockey movie or an exercise in flag-waving. It's really a character study of a man who dreamed big and inspired others to do the same.A pretty solid drive, delivering the uplift we expect from this sort of enterprise.Miracle has the feel of a fairy tale populated by real people.You don't have to know a blue line from a soup line to appreciate Miracle. You'll end up cheering anyway.",

        "document": "British filmmaker Havana Marking's entertaining first feature documentary.Although not breaking new ground in terms of the way it is shot and edited, this is a compelling story and features some excellent archive footage.This documentary about the Afghani version of American Idol is good and worth a look, but I was never swept up by it emotionally.Not a radical act of film-making and visually, it is far from an inspired piece of work - but it's a great example of a film where the strong content rules supreme.Although sadly rife with gut-clenching moments as those, Afghan Star is most thrilling when depicting the show's delicately balanced effort to bring Afghans together despite their fractious ethnic and clan boundaries.If you think American Idol is a cultural phenomenon here, imagine its impact on a country devastated by 30 years of internal strife, religious intolerance, civil war and foreign invasion.This is about an Afghan culture that is at a real turning point.Afghan Star provides us with an up-close peek at the more progressive side of war-torn Afghanistan.Fascinating, 'Afghan Star' pictures the familiar dropped into a totally foreign context distanced even more by recent and continuing bloody strife.Afghan Star is as entertaining as any talent competition but also has a strong socio-political story, providing a revealing look at Afghanistan as its rebuilds after years of war, Taliban rule and struggles with democracy.An absorbing - if, inevitably, impressionistic - picture of life in Kabul and beyond....insightful document that gives you so much more than the well-done look at a reality show.Havana Marking's excellent, illuminating film follows four Afghan Star finalists over the frenetic final months leading to the Moment of Truth.Director Havana Marking's work is quite moving, particularly when it follows two of the three women who compete with nearly 2000 male applicants for the title.This eye-opening film reveals that even systems as dubious as the Idol format mean dramatically different things when transferred to radically dissimilar cultures.A pleasantly uplifting film, one built upon hope and the strength of the human spirit.Afghan Star reveals that the Afghan people strongly crave to make up for years lost to Taliban repression and catch up with the 21st century.Marking follows four contestants for the three months leading up to \"Afghan Star's\" finale and, while there are some amusing parallels to \"American Idol,\" it is also clear Glambert would risk stoning had he been performing in Afghanistan.In its vivid, suspenseful depiction of a high-stakes competition for prize money and the honor of being named Afghanistan's top singer, Afghan Star goes much deeper.If you think it's impossible to underestimate the cultural significance of American Idol, go see British filmmaker Havana Marking's documentary about its Afghani imitator.An extraordinary documentary about an American Idol-like TV show that manages to capture the volatile mix of history, religion, and pop culture in contemporary war-torn Afghanistan.Using popular culture as a window onto the hopes and fears of contemporary Afghanistan, Havana Marking's winning documentary is worth making a song and dance about.Afghan Star sets out with a delectably postmodern agenda.Informative and encouraging documentary.Simon Cowell does Kabul!Fascinating and, when you see Afghan versions of Simon Cowell and Co. reacting to tryouts, a reminder of how fame and the thirst for it is the same in any language.If nothing else, Afghan Star offers a reminder of how much has changed in Afghanistan from the late '70s -- when Kabul was a secular-oriented city with co-ed universities and a thriving nightclub scene -- to the rise of the Taliban.The movie uses the talent show Afghan Star as a prism through which to examine the fragmented tribal culture of Afghanistan as reflected in the backgrounds of four finalists (two of them women) and the public responses to their performances.Entertaining and pointed, reveals the cultural, political, and social power of an old-fashioned televised talent show in a country where voting is a newfangled notion.A lively, compelling and illuminating documentary.One of the most hopeful and heart-rending movies I've seen this year.In the end, who wins and loses the competition is incidental. The power of Marking's film comes from the fact the competition exists at all.An informative documentary revealing how decades of war and years of Taliban repression have fallen to the wayside, however briefly, as Kabul's answer to American Idol seduces a violence-weary Afghanistan.Like The Kite Runner novel and movie, the documentary Afghan Star succeeds at dramatizing the lives of Afghans, but those we see on screen are real flesh-and-blood characters -- people who let their true feelings emerge.Marking has a good eye for capturing the contradictions of Afghanistan.Of all the films to come out of the conflict, Afghan Star is the most provocative, because its message that people are essentially the same is a dubious, double-edge sword....by the end of the 88 minute journey you'll learn more about contemporary Afghanistan than you will from a month of watching television news in the United States.The film's essential fascination and integrity swamp any qualms about its pacing or all-around moviemaking.The filmmaking itself is pretty much by the numbers...But there's some genuine tension as the competition field narrows.It's an upbeat film, though hardly a convincing one, that shows there's more to the popular TV show than entertainment.But the documentary reveals that tribalism is only one of the problems. \"She should be killed,\" says a young man of a female contestant who dared to dance on stage.Afghanistan's version of American Idol shines a spotlight on a culture in transition. Fascinating -- especially when it comes to the experiences of the woman who's risking her reputation and social standing in order to sing.One of the more surreal docs to come down the pike in some time.And while its style and structure conform to the well-worn template established by docs like 'Spellbound', its success lies in creating an accessible, fun way into serious issues.... more than a popular phenomenon, this documentary shows how a simple, completely apolitical piece of entertainment crosses ethnic, regional and cultural borders...For all the dramatic pull of the competition and insight into current culture and politics in Afghanistan, it's a bit of a shame that the film itself is such a dry affair.Timely and intriguing docu was the winner of the Directing and Audience Awards at the Sundance Film Fest.While its style and structure conform to the well-worn template established by docs like Spellbound, its success lies in creating an accessible, fun way into serious issues.An inspiring, fun documentary.Afghan Star is an engaging and important film and what it lacks in depth, it makes up for in cultural impact. Worth seeing.The film is both optimistic and depressing. This film is about a real war with real deaths that is going on in Afghanistan and one of the battlefields of that war is a pop music contest on television.It's a shrewd and entertaining guide to this popular phenomenon, which even the Taliban cannot quite suppress, though nothing in the film quite matches the poignancy and power of its opening minute, showing a blind child singing about the power of love.For once, the McDonald's-like spreading of American culture abroad seems to have actually been a good thing.Afghanistan's very own pop idols go head-to-head in a bright and sometimes troubling behind-the-scenes documentary - dancing is a no-no.Tracking the rebuilding of this decimated, divided country through the prism of trash TV might seem trite, but Havana Marking's ambitious if overstretched documentary is sobering stuff.Sobering and cautiously optimistic, Havana Marking's documentary is a treat.Havana Marking's uproarious, awareness-raising documentary tells us more about the title country than a month of newscasts.",

        "document": "McCarthy puts a mark on each film, identifying it as distinctly his own. A couple more like them, and he'll be knighted an auteur.This gifted writer/director knows how to illuminate those moments in which people realize they have become essential to each other -- that each person's life has been gently changed by the other's presence.The script here is very strong.The film works foremost as the experience of watching Richard Jenkins inhabit his role.A wonderful human story, a beautifully directed and acted film of rare grace that just might renew your faith in life- and movies.[Richard Jenkins] gets the role of a lifetime in this powerful second film by writer-director Thomas McCarthy.Richard Jenkins and \"The Visitor\" make lovely music together. It's a case of a veteran character actor slipping on a leading role like the most comfortable pair of pants in the world.The Visitor is America working out the demons of Sept. 11, 2001. Director Thomas McCarthy brilliantly focuses on characters who love life despite the less savory circumstances surrounding them.not really a film you enjoy, per se. It's more like a feeling you get used to before finally accepting.Thoroughly, refreshingly unique, a film that weaves a tight, timely tale that is equal parts heart-warming and wrenching.The Visitor, featuring an award-caliber performance by Richard Jenkins as the prof, is a heartfelt human drama that sneaks up and floors you.A polite, gentle drama about friendship and musical expression, \"Visitor\" dances slowly, but effectively, working its way to the heart.The Visitor is a low-key, naturalistic, beautifully observed character study about the quiet angst of the buttoned-down soul.Dull and depressing, The Visitor is leaden, lethargic and full of heavy-handed symbolism. The Statue of Liberty keeps popping up in the movie, which uses it like a cheap stage prop.Character actor Richard Jenkins gives a performance that is at once restrained and speaks volumes, a breakthrough to leading man status after decades of supporting roles.Scores by expanding its scope beyond the hot-button issue of illegal immigration to encompass themes of friendship and breaking free of a stifling routine.This is a small picture that explodes the boundaries of what size really means. Sometimes it's the smallest gesture that makes you feel most alive.The curious thing about The Visitor is that even as it goes more or less where you think it will, it still manages to surprise you along the way.McCarthy unquestionably means well, but he's made one of those incredibly naive movies (like last fall''s Rendition) that give liberals -- Hollywood liberals especially -- a bad name.Far too much of a mixed bag to be completely effective, but allows for some fun and unexpected moments and solid performances.Dabbles in messages and liberal guilt, but more importantly, it sets up a reasonable and genuine space for a fascinating and heartbreaking character.It's a lovely, moving film, marked by memorable performances throughout.Exactly the type of movie the GOP would rather Americans not see, as it individualizes (rather than demonizes) its foreign characters and provides them with a collective voice that demands to be heard.A character study drowning in liberal guilt.Uplifting and undeniably winning in its perceptive landscape, The Visitor is no stranger to compelling filmmaking rooted in gentleness and inspirational fortitudeIt is a lovely, well-crafted, bittersweet little film.The best movies are those that understand the human condition and have a personal vision. The Visitor is one of those rare creations. The Visitor is a parable of decency.The not-so subliminal message about life being fair versus breaking the law isn't enough to carry a film purporting to be a character-driven drama.Jenkins, as always has a quiet, almost apologetic hesitation to his performance that serves him well as Walter....a very sweet and gentle film.A showcase role for otherwise supporting actor Richard Jenkins, and he makes the most of it without ever being showy.The Visitor tells of renewal through love. Its song is tinged with sadness, but stirring all the same.McCarthy is so careful not to take a political stand that his film seems neutered by good intentions. In the spirit of squishy humanism, he soft-pedals a hard-hitting topic.The movie is writer-director Tom McCarthy's follow-up to his 2003 debut, the well-liked The Station Agent, and it shares that film's offbeat, humanistic spirit.Both director and cast exhibit the dedication of those who truly believe in the message at hand.Best movie I've seen so far this year? Hands down, it's Tom McCarthy's superb The Visitor, which turns Richard Jenkins, one of the best character actors in the business, into a full-fledged star.[Director Thomas McCarthy] demonstrates a delicate, irresistible touch when it comes to lonely, eccentric characters, but he widens his canvas with a small, resonant story that could be ripped from today's headlines.All the main characters are inherently decent, and the humanity of their saga, which centers on illegal immigration, makes for a deeply moving film.Not a polemic, but a character-driven work, made all the more riveting by sensitive performances not only by Jenkins in his first leading role, but the entire cast.Depicts the way a professor's closed-off heart is opened by music, friendship, and love; one of the most touching and impressive films of the year.Actor/director Tom McCarthy's follow up to his award-winning debut, The Station Agent, avoids any notion of a sophomore curse by being an even more polished effort than his debut.The Visitor might unite both sides of the illegal immigration debate - at least for two hours.Jenkins, a veteran character actor perhaps best known as the dead father on Six Feet Under, gets the role of a career here......a literate and low-key character study of an ordinary man in depressingly average straits.Cuts across one of the West's most contentious political issues without ever getting political. And it features a terrific lead performance from Jenkins.The charms and wonders of the film lie in the performances of the leads, all of whom are better than perfect -- they feel real.A gently moving film that can warm your heart as easily as break it.Sophisticated, timely and compelling, it's a quintessential post-9/11 drama.It's almost funny how often and how closely The Visitor teeters toward clich\u00e9, only to deliver one gently genuine moment after another.Beautifully acted and staged, but at odds with itself: the emphasis is not on the 'visitors' but on the uptight professor, who experiences a spiritual rebirth thanks to the life-affirming presence of his new Third World friends...... I almost want to regurgitate that shawarma I once ate.Much more interested in its interpersonal relationships than it is in climbing a soapbox and preaching to the choir.Finally an effective, timely and enjoyable political melodrama that contests stereotypes and centers on culture collision between Americans and Muslims, with tour de force, Oscar-caliber turn from Richard Jenkins as the emotionally sheltered professor.The Visitor's allusions to our f----up state-of-affairs feel like gratuitous background noise.If McCarthy is the divinity of the universe he creates, its patron saint is Frank Capra ... The primordial truth about Capra's and McCarthy's characters is that if you scratch beneath the surface, just about everyone is decent.Focused entirely on these people and how the unplanned relationships affect their lives.A marvelous film, small in expense but big in stature.This audaciously issues-loaded indie drama works, improbably and entirely, on account of the marvelous, often familiar-looking, rarely starring character actor Richard Jenkins and his perfect performance as a stodgy, widowed economics professor.Jenkins does a great job with the material and Tom McCarthy's latest is quality work that deserves attention.Tom McCarthy's The Visitor, from his own screenplay, is nothing short of a triumph for 60-year-old character actor Richard Jenkins, in his first leading role in a feature film.This is a simple story of human drama that provides an incentive to spend a couple of hours in a movie theater during a spring that has not provided many such reasons.The Visitor presents a rich, complex world where people connect in unexpected ways. It is a fitting follow up to the themes McCarthy covered in The Station Agent....a celebration of multiculturalism as an American virtue.Surefire material to pluck the heartstrings and for thesentimentally inclined, but......extremely well-written and well-acted, but it was far too politically biased...it reminded me of a Soviet or Chinese Communist propaganda film.The tension dips occasionally but stick with it and you'll be richly rewarded.A beautiful, quiet, measured movie about the death of some American values since September 11, 2001.This is an exquisite and subtle character portrait and all the performances are wonderful.Beautifully cast and superbly performed, The Visitor never steps off the mark either emotionally or in character development. Richard Jenkins, usually in support roles, rises to the lead occasion with grace and a marvellously restrained performanceThe beautifully restrained performance by [Richard] Jenkins is the anchor of a film built around complex characters and quiet moments.For those who want to see slowly evolving character studies that are very rewarding, THE VISITOR is a bullseye.The performances are very strong and the film is very well-written.A film that is a combination immigrant/resurrection tale, Visitor tilts toward the soulful rather than the political and could be this year's humanistic indie hit....rife with compelling figures that ultimately sustain the viewer's interest even through a few less-than-subtle moments.Actor-turned-filmmaker Tom McCarthy demonstrates that the critical acclaim for The Station Agent in 2003 was no fluke.This is unquestionably one of the most moving motion pictures you will ever see, and yet, at film's end, you will be left wanting for more.A lovely, quietly touching film that approaches a provocative and topical subject with dramatic sensitivity and graceful understatement.The Visitor is a small movie, but its emotions could not be writ any larger.Awards season may still be many months away, but it's not too early to declare both the filmmaker and Jenkins Oscar-worthy.A smart, beautifully acted character drama.The film becomes less about the suffering of immigrants who have never enjoyed the embrace of Ellis Island than the righteous indignation of a liberal intelligentsia raging against its own powerlessness.The story of Vale's revitalization and his grief is compelling but simple, free of any sentimentality, and marked by powerful performances from Jenkins and Hiam Abbass, who plays Mouna Khalil, Tarek's mother.The Visitor is a small film; it's also an incandescent one.Definitely a film that marches to its own drumbeat.The Visitor is best enjoyed as a chance to see some new faces, or old faces like Jenkins', doing new things.The astonishing sensitivity with which Richard Jenkins approaches his role is nicely complimented by the performances of other cast members.Its mushy humanism is...insidious.The Visitor gives Richard Jenkins a chance to develop a character for the whole running time.Un retrato sutil y sensible sobre la inesperada conexi\u00f3n que se produce entre cuatro personas de diferentes culturas y or\u00edgenes, y tambi\u00e9n una postal algo desencantada y agridulce de la Nueva York posterior al 11/9.

There are some thought-provoking discussions in the film patched periodically with rough spots.Tasting the bitter fruits of globalizationclick for full reviewOur patience with the characters' apathy and uninteresting demeanor is not rewarded enough.At first glance Walter isn't a guy you want to spend two hours with. But by the end of the film, you don't want to see him go. Jenkins is like that: He sneaks up on you and steals your heart with light-fingered skill.(Richard) Jenkins doesn't waste a motion or a word while bestowing on us an introspective acting clinic. They don't call them character actors for nothing.As close to a perfect movie as we're likely to see this year.The Visitor may not have any big names in its cast, but it certainly makes up for that by having a lot of character.[Director] McCarthy has an undeniable way with actors, and it sustains our interest in this overt Good Samaritan tale.Poignant, intelligent, thematically nuanced and character-driven, The Visitor is a drama about illegal aliens in which the native son is the brother from another planet.The real subject here isn't post-9/11 xenophobia but rather friendship, how it changes us, heals us and how the arbitrary intrusion of outside forces both threatens and strengthens us.The Visitor is a tiny treasure of a movie. This is a wistful comedy that quickly finds its rhythm, but never lets that groove become a rut.This is one of those surprising little gems that make you happy to be an ardent moviegoer.The movie is grounded in a fundamental difficulty, that Walter's education is achieved by his engagement with this set of brown and black people.Insightful drama shatters post-9/11 stereotypes.Makes political points via a fascinating tale of an unlikely friendship between people of vastly different cultures.The Visitor is a delicate, human reminder of why independent films matter.Both halves of the story ring true in their way, but they don't ring out in harmony.In The Visitor, Jenkins finally gets a starring role, and he makes the most of the opportunity with a brilliantly sustained performance that gives depth, resonance and spiritual transcendence to what starts out to be one of his stock characters.The Visitor gives viewers a perceptive, deeply personal take on the timeless immigrant narrative, in which the most epic journey is finally one of self-discovery.These characters feel like they exist before the cameras roll and after the credits are done, and it is the audience who are the true visitors, inspired by just getting to spend some time with them.The film addresses the timely issues of post-9/11 immigration and incarceration, but avoids polemics by keeping the focus solely on the human cost of our government's policies.Small but sincere.This is a film of our times -- paranoid, heartbroken, disillusioned -- and the rare recent American movie whose characters react the way actual people might.",

        "document": "A beautifully made, provocative and very righteous documentary.The documentary Black Gold tells an unresolved modern version of the age-old David and Goliath story.Punctuated by long shots of foggy mountainsides as well as very close shots of glistening green coffee beans on the tree, the film makes its argument with the help of an evocative score by Andreas Kapsalis.Economic repression by competitive market forces is a systemic injustice in this corner of the marketplace.It almost makes you want to be forced to spend six bucks for a latte.Compared to a documentary like Darwin's Nightmare, which found disturbing visual analogues for the moral rot of global trade, Black Gold makes most of its points in words, not pictures.A dry but enlightening documentary.Meskela's is a story worth tackling again -- but without the over-caffeinated approach.The film serves as a valuable explanation of the ways in which the cultivation and exportation of a particular crop can affect the welfare of fragile countries.A mesmerizing documentary illuminating the human element in one corner of modern global trade.Whether due to resources or time or just plain laziness, directors Marc and Nick Francis have fashioned a rather shapeless movie that raises many good points but fails to fully investigate its findings.If that $2 cup of Starbucks didn't jolt you awake, this documentary by Marc and Nick Francis might do the trick.Black Gold moves at an inexorable pace, painstakingly building a case until suddenly it looms very large and casts an even longer shadow.... there is an additional irony to the title: The raw beans are not themselves black, but the growers are.The film's effectiveness is bolstered by juxtaposed scenes of fat and happy Americans and Europeans slurping up frozen chai lattes and clucking about how big Starbuck's is getting with scenes of children going into 'therapeutic feeding centers'.Black Gold raises issues in an engaging way without preaching or becoming a lesson in economics. At the end of it all you will certainly be looking for those Fair Trade stickers.Warm relaxing pace becomes languishing, most of the beans have been spilt by the halfway mark. Still, it's definitely educational, an effective call to action.The premise powerfully postulated here is that not only Ethiopians, but millions and millions of other Africans are suffering due to the paltry prices paid by big business for natural resources which most people from developed countries take for granted.The film raises issues that were mere sound bites during the 2005 G8 Summit. All that's missing is Bono's seal of approval.There are shocking facts and supportive images, but the film lacks investigative spirit.Intimate interviews with starving farmers selling beans for 24p a kilo while we pay 2 a cup will make you appreciate the importance of fair-trade when ordering your next double-shot, skinny latte.While it may prompt some to think again next time they're in Starbucks, this astute insight into the coffee business is better at lauding the good guys than taking the multinationals to task for the iniquities of the global economy.True, fair trade coffee is not the newest story around, but Black Gold still makes for arresting viewing.Contrast that with shots of the grower's malnourished children relying on emergency foreign aid and it's enough to make your blood boil - never mind the coffee.If you don't buy Fair Trade coffee after this you never will.A worthy look at an exploitation that really shouldn't exist in this day and age, Black Gold will hopefully shock audiences into looking for the Fairtrade symbol next time they're in the supermarket.It is attractively shot, thoughtfully edited, provocatively argued, and might just have you turning its issues over in your mind late into the night - or is that just the effect of so much coffee?While the film is quick to posit fair trade as a solution, it fails to answer why, even with Meskela's admirable initiatives, his coffee farmers still struggle to buy shoes.The Francis brothers maintain a lively pace and a satirical mood.An important and timely film that may make you think twice before downing your next cup of joe.The lesson is clear: The system is broken and needs repair, and educating consumers is part of the solution.... a by turns poetic and hard-hitting critique of the global coffee industry ...A hard-hitting documentary in support of Fair Trade focusing on the tireless efforts of a manager of a coffee grower's cooperative in Ethiopia to get members more money for their labors.A beautifully made film that takes time to observe the beauties (and horrors) of its world.This is a documentary that gets a lot across while avoiding cliches and easy exploitation, even in famine-ravaged places where more horrific images must have abounded.More dynamism and knowledge in the telling and fewer cheap shots at young Starbucks workers in Seattle wouldn't have gone amiss.Guaranteed to make you think twice about what you're paying for what you're drinking.\"Black Gold\" also finds cause for optimism in its connections, showing how if Western coffee drinkers make the right choices at their end, they can positively affect the African growers at the other.Black Gold is more an Al Gore-style message of hope than a total downer.Although some scenes register with strong impact, there also seems to be a lot of padding, and the overall narrative is ultimately too diffused and unfocused for the film to have the sociological impact it so obviously desires.Black Gold, a compelling documentary about the international coffee industry, might discourage you from ever drinking a cup of joe again. At the very least, it'll make you think deeply about what's going into that cup.There is obviously a serious imbalance here and even if the filmmakers don't get the complete picture, they at least make a case for the farmers themselves.Nowhere near as probing as it could or should be. Valuable points are blunted by too many talking heads.As coffee drinkers know, not all beans are equal, but the meaning of inequality gets an entirely different spin in Marc and Nick Francis' handsome and astute doc, Black Gold.A film to think about every time you order a Triple Grande Soy Latte....gorgeously-shot, melancholy.No mere Western-guilt-inducing harangue, this highly informative documentary by British brothers Marc and Nick Francis is a model of patient storytelling.",

A[A] wholly unobjectionable, likeably performed but faintly soporific drama ...It tells you a lot about South India, its essentially rural culture and the stifling poverty of its underclass.Told with real warmth and charm, this is a confidently handled tale boosted by natural, engaging performances from Venkatesh and Jahangir Badshah as his young friend.Hopefully Smith will make more movies in this laid-back, poetic style.Smith's film is natural and unforced, with a winning fluency and calm observational style.A fascinating narrative set in modern-day Indian and full of insights into a class-riven country.Here are filigree detailing, pure-and-simple performances (especially from Venkatesh Chavan as the boy) and a subtly lambent moral tale ...One of the weirdest, most original entries in this year's dramatic competition--American indie set in Goe with Hindu actors--The Pool should divide film critics, but a closer look beneath the surface reveals consistent themes in Smith's growing oeuvreThe entire film is shot in static shots, creating a cinema style that evoles into an extension of reality.One of the many pleasures of The Pool is watching how these culturally opposite people find common ground, and become involved with each other through such simple acts as home gardening and conversation.Such a different movie from the Americana Chris Smith has covered in his previous films ... but it's a refreshing departure that gives us a different glimpse at the people of India than we've seen in common Bollywood fare.The Pool conveys a sense of having been made, not found, but Smith avoids mawkishness and has an ear for how young people speak and relate to one another.The Pool is as quietly pleasant as its namesake.Many directors claim to value local color, but few have gone as far, or achieved such impressive results, as has Chris Smith in The Pool.It doesn't sound like much, but in the hands of director Chris Smith, this setup makes for a good small-scale observational picture about young people finding that the world is a larger place than they imagined.For his keenly observant narrative feature debut, documentary filmmaker Chris Smith and writer Randy Russell have deftly transposed Russell's short story The Pool from Iowa to the Indian state of Goa, in the small city of Panjim.It's a bit schematic and sweet-natured, perhaps to a fault, yet the faces linger.It's a beautiful little movie.By pushing himself far outside his Midwestern comfort zone and working with non-actors in a language he doesn't speak, Smith has created a fable with universal appeal.The Pool takes viewers on a journey to Goa that is startling not only in the lush physical beauty it reveals but also in the subtle, finely wrought emotions it stirs.A film that is a kind of counter-film, which sets expectations in an environment that supports unexpected results.Documentary filmmaker Chris Smith's feature debut is startling, original and quietly winning.Based on a story by Randy Russell, The Pool is a low-key film that often feels like a documentary...It's a movie about a time, a place and a situation that isn't going to change soon. [Director] Smith takes his time to establish the people, the landscape and the striking contrast between the lives of the very rich and the very poor.A miraculous, American-made Hindi film that is every bit as tranquil as the blue-green reservoir that serves as its abiding metaphor.Patekar's ability to convey stoic forbearance with so little apparent effort, is one of the marvellous rewards of this intricately textured and compelling film.Reality and fiction fuse like watercolors in this quietly compelling narrative feature.worth seeing, primarily for its beautiful Goa settingSatisfying tale of marginalized youth struggling to survive alone in a cold world and dreaming of success despite all odds against them.It tells a tale so sweetly elemental and classic that it could pretty much have happened along at any point in storytelling history.The Pool is beautiful to look at, and, for what it conveys about human nature, to experience.Shimmers silently. A quietly remarkable film, for its seeming simplicity, its careful rhythms, and its interest in a place and its spirit.It's hard to think of a more welcome piece of American filmmaking.Instead of a collection of souvenir-tchotchke exotic vistas, The Pool is an album of observed human minutiae.The film has a refreshing sense of proportion without seeming as determinedly minor or mannered as other indies. It's a vivid piece of sketchwork.A quiet, quirky, well-observed fiction about aspiration and connection.A charming and enjoyable movie.This unassuming yet hugely ambitious undertaking reveals a filmmaker with an impressive range and depth of feeling that is only now becoming apparent.A lovely, warm, unforced film that gives you time to get to know its characters and isn't propelled by any artificial narrative conventions, or for that matter by any Dickensian social outrage.The resonant, beautifully naturalistic drama The Pool is a return to the familiar subject of haves and have-nots for director Chris Smith.The Pool takes a look at the lives of the haves and the someday might haves in Goa.Chris Smith's low-key coming-of-age film/slice of contemporary Indian life takes forever to get where it's going, which turns out to be pretty much nowhere.",

        "document": "In the end, all the violence and sexual hijinks begin to pall, like a conversation with an intelligent person who litters his speech with profanities.A deep blue sea of great acting, directing, and writing. It is quite illuminating, for those of you who are not afraid to take the plunge into its murky waters.Watch this one for the performances, but bring a pillow.Gleaming, erotic and unsettling.A gripping tale of eroticism and sexual fantasy that keeps grips with its taught atmosphere and passionate performances.This over-the-top, historically based dark comedy is little more than sloganeering (from the Hollywood entertainment industry) masquerading as art.Sincero homenaje al impulso creativo que todo ser humano tiene dentro de s\u00ed y un recordatorio de que el \u00f3rgano sexual m\u00e1s poderoso es la imaginaci\u00f3nThough I admired Quills greatly, it lacks the sublime sophistication of Kaufman's earlier erotic works.The most entertaining and appallingly funny anti-censorship movie since Milos Foreman's The People Vs. Larry Flynt.Aside from the performances, it's a depraved, lurid flick about a depraved, lurid man and all the depraved, lurid things his stories inspire others to do.the film's anti-censorship themes come through strongly without being plainly didactica festival of snobbish, yet still plainly sophomoric puns. I'm not appalled by the vulgarity ... I'm appalled by the lack of entertainment.Geoffrey Rush steals the show as a charismatic madman, but the story is too dated to resonate beyond its little corner of history.I'm glad I saw it, but I wish I could unsee it somehow.Kaufman here reminds us why he was once one of the most high profile directorsIt is much, much more than a political tract -- indeed, it is a mesmerizingly told tale.An exhilarating, stunningly mounted, vigorously intelligent and oddly poetic tale also about the sadistic social institutions impinging on human history.Quills valiantly argues that bold ideas can not - and should not - be stopped.Quills, about the marquis de Sade, is a voluptuous impasto. Everything in it -- the colors, the locations, the people -- seems swirled with a mixture of decadence and grace....fairly oozes with delicious irony.This is soft-gore porn, obvious in its strategies, witless in the play of its ideas, absurdist only in its pretense to seriousness.An oddly tamed and sanitized version of de Sade.Too violent and sexually frank for art-house audiences and too wordy for thrill-seekers.What begins promisingly ... quickly turns from wicked to insipid, taking a thematic plunge into insanity from which there is no recovery.As biography and black comedy, Quills comes up short.Experiencing this pretentious wallow -- overwritten, under-thought and overdone -- is a very sophisticated form of torture.I'm inclined to agree with my colleague Michael Musto, who suggested that the reason various characters have their tongues ripped out is to prevent the actors from chewing away the scenery.Feels like a Masterpiece Theater spoof.The film failed because it was too dull to be entertaining and it didn't have anything startling to say about a startling subject.The movie may be too lacking in subtlety to qualify as great, but its star performance is not to be forgotten.Rush often makes the film soar with a sense of enlightened madness.It's a riveting story, beautiful to look at, well-acted, and it's full of all your favorite perverted sex stuff.Voraciously tantalizing.By portraying in a splendidly visual manner the human need to tell stories and to have stories told, Quills should be considered a success.Marvelously alive and meticulously crafted.A potent, arch, humorous and downright fascinating glimpse into a society both terrified and titillated by literary descriptions of raging sexuality.A movie about words and ideas that will make you think.This is not for the weak of stomach, but is well worth the trip to the theater.Relentlessly smart and witheringly critical, yet morally playful to the core.It's funny, exciting, and intriguing.Here is the archetypal clash between the establishment forces of morality and the creative spirit of a subversive artist.The film is neither a glorification nor a condemnation, but something much more interesting.The dramatic case is too settled, the narrative trajectory too smug, the view of the transgressive artist too naive.However stylish and intelligently-crafted as it might be, Quills ultimately proves too blunt an instrument to be either veryIt's dark, tragic and oh so good. See it!Quills [is watchable], if you've got the stomach. It's just a little bit mad.Rush relishes his role, delivering screenwriter Doug Wright's unexpectedly funny lines with lascivious glee while still bringing a certain gravity to the character.It's hard not to cheer him on, even as the film itself erases De Sade more than it reveals him.It skewers its manufactured hypocrites decisively but unconvincingly, like fish in a barrel.Pretentious, long-winded.While it may not have delivered a knock out, Quills certainly does pack a solid punch.A literate, dialogue-driven treat delivered by a cast that truly savors the script's wicked wit.Philip Kaufman ... knows how to push the write buttons and leave all participants, well, satisfied.A pose-y, pungent, ultra-theatrical yet weirdly seductive mess.Refreshingly direct.It's an unapologetic dazzler, which is why it's never overwhelmed by its themes.A powerful and atmospheric film that delivers a barrage of images and concepts of both sexual and philosophical natures.Triumphs over potentially claustrophobic material.A witty yet fiery and, in the best sense, provocative play of ideas about freedom of expression.Stirring on a lusty, primal level that touches that baser human nature de Sade probed in his work.The elegance of Mr. Kaufman's direction and his handling of the cast make for the kind of euphoric stylishness that has been missing from moviegoing for some time.Arguably the most provocative and best historical melodrama of 2000.An intriguing movie, it leaves you with a lot to ponder.There's so much gusto thrown into the performances and attention to period detail that Quills plays out as enjoyably lavish.Shrill, pretentious, sophomoric and often just plain dumb.The demonized Marquis de Sade and the questions he posed concerning legislation of speech or thought remain relevant.The Gothic tale grabs the eyeballs and keeps them transfixed to the screen.Gives us an anatomy of fear, images both silken swift and molten hot, scenes that disrupt and inflame the imagination.All the major performances in Quills are Oscar-worthy.Engages our intellect before our lust. It's tantamount to staging a rock concert with one finger on the mute button.You won't get big, flash F/X and explosions or lines like \"I'll be back,\" but you will get a thought provoking yarn about a man whose name is in the dictionary.Kaufman keeps things colourful and very lively, and Rush has a ball with the performance--camping it up without ever going over the top, every line is double entendre, but there's real grit underneath.Succeeds in creating a portrait of Sade as a man who must fulfill his desperate -- involuntary -- need to write in order to affirm his own existence.A decent period piece livened up by two hours of pretty disturbing material.A rare Hollywood movie that is about the nature of eroticism without being afraid of its own power to arouse.So bold, ambitious and forceful that it practically has a right to be a good movie. It's not, but it may be the year's most memorable bad one.It breathes, it twirls, it prances right up into your face. It swirls over the top sometimes, but there never is any doubt you're watching a movie about something.For those looking for a well-made and mostly captivating experience, this might be the film for you.We get little insight as Rush strips and rants and rots.Kaufman ... finds a tone that remains more entertaining than depressing, more absorbing than alarming.It argues its case fairly, acknowledging the implicit dangers in its position, and dramatizing the price that inevitably will be paid for its cherished goal of untrammeled personal expression.Geoffrey Rush plays this rascal to the magnificent hilt.\"Quills\" is sensational in every sense of the word.Kaufman's biopic of the notorious Marquis de Sade is sharply uneven, serious, poignant, trashy, sleazy and sensationslist, marred by over-the-top turn from Geoffrey Rush.a conceptual piece about the nature of creativity and questions of artIt pokes at sexual taboos - it's pretty subversive, considering - but sexuality and creativity are indelibly linked, and its true subject is expression, repression and catharsis.While it is horrible and sordid, it's also witty, fast-paced and intriguing as it explores freedom of expression.You'll swear you can hear a throaty cackle of approval from the hereafter.Kaufman and writer Doug Wright (adapting his own play) infuse the film with a decadent playfulness befitting a film about the Marquis.\u2554 uma pena que o Oscar, ao contr\u0440rio de outras premia\u0443\u0448es, n\u0441o possua uma categoria de 'Melhor Elenco'.This simplicity in its anti-censorship message keep it from achieving the greatness that it strives for.If Ismael Merchant and James Ivory ... decided to make a film about Hell, it would look like this.A marvelous, saucy romp.The material benefits from a top-rank cast that fleshes out what could seem merely an exercise in philosophy.Taut pacing, delicate, unobtrusive foreshadowing and a series of impeccable performances, unforgettable for their passion.Geoffrey Rush unleashes a tour-de-force performance.As film, it feels as cramped as de Sade's cell. As metaphor, it is ham-fisted.Director Philip Kaufman makes a defense of art, but he doesn't put a petticoat on it. He chooses a subject who represents art at its worst, and plunges bravely on.More heavy-handed than memorable.Made with intelligence and care.Kaufman is one of the great, underappreciated maestros of the movies, and his work here is indeed masterly.As frustrating as it is intriguing.",

        "document": "Selling the gospel with flatulence, horny old men, penis-size jokes, vengeful wronged women, outrageous drag queen grandmas and drug humor apparently pays pretty darned well.A mess.A romantic and righteous - but also schizoid - movie.Spits in the face of all pretexts to artistry, to craftsmanship, to simple good taste.it's funny enough to overcome the cliches, and sweet enough to make those cliches feel warm and fuzzySloppy, insipid mishmash of female empowerment, Christian thought and gun-and-weed jokes is an early front-runner for Worst Film of 2005.Like Perry's acting, the movie swings from manic comedy to quiet drama in a heartbeat.The humor is so cartoonish that it's impossible to take the \"serious\" content as being representative of anything remotely real.Diary of a Mad Black Woman is a shambling affair.Talk about mixed messages. Here's a cruel, mean-spirited movie that's supposed to have a Christian theme.There's an audience for this schizophrenic movie, without question, but that doesn't make it any better.A would-be feminist farce that will leave you slackjawed at its incompetence.Perry doesn't have any delusions of artistry, and potentially, at least, that's refreshing. But any points he earns for lack of pretense are immediately gobbled up by his lack of subtlety.Here is a brand new genre: A black-Christian romantic revenge comedy. It doesn't quite work, but Tyler Perry is a jewel.Much of the plot is either corny, ridiculous or derivative.So many disparate pieces cannot be forced into cohesion.I'm at a loss to explain anything about this film.The film strains to be funny just as hard as the audience strains to stay awake.Perhaps the juxtaposition of slapstick comedy and stark drama somehow works on stage, but it's jarringly off-putting on film.A crudely made hodgepodge of rank clich\u00e9s that veers between shrill melodrama, glossy soap opera, and broad, sitcom-level comedy.[Jams] together not two but three separate genres that probably should have remained that way.It is a film full of jagged edges, but one that is sincere and beguiling at its core.In an extremely strange genre combo, inner city gross out comedy meets evangelical passion play in Diary Of A Mad Black Woman.Syrupy drama -- not much here for kids.A satisfying end, but it takes a lot of work -- and a lot of suspended disbelief -- to get there.What ruins this revenge flick is Madea's boorish, bull in the china store act reminiscent of the sassy black woman stereotype popularized by Sanford and Son's Aunt Esther. Loud and ignorant, Medea tends to trivialize every scene.As a comedy this movie works. As a love story, the movie contains no sparks. The dialogue is stilted and unnatural, which belittles the drama.This bizarre movie is many things--a celebration of Christian values, a drag act, a drug plunge, a soap opera, a sitcom revenge fantasy.This movie really touched upon an aspect of black life that we can all identify with. More realistic then all of these ghettofied movies that have been presented as representation of black life previously.This is a film that's gone way beyond the realm of bad, past disaster. This one's in the area of all-time grand mistakes.It must be a hoot when performed live. But it only works in spurts on screen.Helen's chaste swain wants intimacy, not sex. C'mon-even Baptists are interested in sex. They just don't do it standing up, because someone might think they were dancing.It's never less than watchable, a bizarre hybrid that somehow works as a whole, even though its various components don't mesh.the film's dramatic components are just as outrageous as its comedic momentsMadea is a way to model a raucous, powerful, but still jokey mad woman-ness for Helen.It's a cheap melodrama that presses all the right sentimental buttons.What works in the theater doesn't always work in the movies. Part of the problem, as mentioned, is with the broadness of the material. But it doesn't help that the script relies way too much on syrupy voiceovers....a passion play with a guy in drag (who could ask for anything more?)...Perry's writing is dramaturgy of the most primitive kind, with melodramatic situations, tons of woozy sentiment, and humor which might be described as 'lowbrow,' were that not probably too elevated a term for it.Blandly directed and dramatically shameless.Woman leaves the audience with the burden of maintaining a church-appropriate patience to appreciate the small charms to be found in Perry's berserk creation.Mr. Perry's irrepressible energy and rapid-fire wit bring Robin Williams to mind.A lot of it shouldn't work -- and doesn't -- but even while you're sitting there, thinking that it can't go much farther off track, it manages to be fairly involving.With tonal shifts so abrupt that they could give you motion sickness, it goes from cheesy soap opera to bad slapstick to gooey romance to mean-spirited farce.The messages are nothing if not mixed. On the one hand, Perry's script is a pious celebration of Christian charity and patience. On the other ... well, just look at the MPAA rating.It's so heartfelt that you'd have to be a curmudgeon to reject its charms outright, and so artificial you'd have to be willfully naive to swallow them whole.To review Diary of a Mad Black Woman is really to review three different movies, none of which is very good.A very curious and very entertaining mix, the Labradoodle of inspirational romantic-comedy-melodramas.Plenty of mad moviegoers will put this in their diaries as one of the worst pictures in ages.This movie stew -- equal parts farce, drama and sermon -- gives you plenty to chew on but, ultimately, is less than filling.Dear Diary, I want to see a better movie than this one, signed an annoyed film critic woman.Some may question the combination of marital drama and madness with earthy slapstick humor but it, surprisingly, works - at times.This isn't a situation in which the right hand doesn't know what the left is doing. It's more like they're not even part of the same body.Some of these problems stem from the film's leap from a theatrical production's play-to-the-rafters bigness to the screen's demands for something more finessed. There's not a lot of nuance here.Half inspired and half eye-rollingly terrible.The primary irritant here is Perry, whose performance is the cinematic equivalent of listening to fingernails scrape a chalkboard for two hours.Rather sloppily blends melodrama and spiritual uplift with crass comedy, sometimes in the same scene.Nobody in the movie seems to know quite what sentiment he or she should be channeling at any given moment.Blows to the head are delivered with more subtlety than the message of Diary of a Mad Black Woman.I've been reviewing movies for a long time, and I can't think of one that more dramatically shoots itself in the foot.This is `Big Momma's House' meets `Misery' meets `Enough.'Rarely has a movie been such a tonal train wreck...rather like riding a cinematic roller coaster, and it may well bring on in the viewer the same sort of nausea....loudly preach(es) Christian values, then turns around to cheer on its wronged-wife heroine as she takes cruel revenge against her (now crippled and helpless) husband...It's a fractured fairy tale for religious zealots and fart-joke enthusiasts that, in its pious lessons of forgiveness, does the unforgivable by using Christianity as a crutch.As is true of so many play adaptations, the theatrically pitched performances don't work as well on the screen.It becomes clear that the strength of Diary is its refusal to bow to convention.If not for the larger-than-life multitasking by Tyler Perry, Diary of a Mad Black Woman would be just another tedious, over-the-top movie about self-discovery.Tyler Perry, even if he's no church-show Peter Sellers, obviously carves out some kind of niche here. Remember, they laughed at Ed Wood. And they're still laughing at him.Not even Tyler Perry in a dress can save this embarrassing mess of a storyWell-intentioned, but terribly stereotypical, falling back on the insulting ghetto speak and flabby caricatures that used to populate In Living Color skits.Comic relief is often welcome in drama, but these broad caricatures, which draw easy laughter as the minstrel turns they are, destroy the sense of reality that a large and hardworking cast is otherwise striving to create.Tyler Perry's movie is so oblivious to genre that it occupies its own special stylistic niche, if you can imagine such a thing as a romantic revenge farce.Displays a blind ineptitude on the level of some of the worst films I've ever seen.... This movie is an absolute train wreck.I'm not sure if Diary of a Mad Black Woman is heartfelt or cynical, but if anyone can write a movie that's both, it's probably Tyler Perry.\"Waiting to Exhale\" crossed with \"Nutty Professor II: The Klumps\"...laughable, but oddly likeableThree separate movies collide in this uneven but heartfelt drama.First-time director Darren Grant gives each scene its face value, with no attempt to look for the real people and situations beneath the polemic.Perry's performance as Madea may have worked onstage, but seems out of place on the screen, even though it's clear he has a great deal of affection for the character.I'm not sure if it's surprising that the film is almost uniformly awful.Grant's broad narrative never quite reaches the subversive tone it's aiming for so awkwardly. Much is thrown into Diary with the flimsy afterthought of a tossed saladBe forewarned that writer/actor Tyler Perry's cross-dressing turn as same only accounts for a meager portion of this cynical exercise in manipulation.Those who aren't already converts to Perry's dramaturgy will wonder what elevates this material above, say, a typical episode of '227.'Tries to be every single movie ever made all at once, leaving the viewer with the emotional equivalent of whiplash.The low comedy and high melodrama, with a touch of inspiration, don't blend easily, and here the match seems forced.Stay clear of this mess.There's nothing real or even funny in Perry's performance; all padding and crude makeup, he shouts every line as if he's still playing to the upper balcony in a rundown Masonic Hall.The material comes off as a serious miscalculation in Perry and director Darren Grant's film adaptation.This peculiar and none-too-felicitous mix of Bible-thumping, heartstring-jerking and man-bashing never finds its tone, careening wildly from slapstick comedy to soapy melodrama.The quality of mercy is a little strained.Raucous and overwrought, the movie is still a hoot to watch and even more fun to talk back to.Watch writer Tyler Perry chew up the scenery in 3 roles.An awful hybrid of Big Momma's House and The Burning Bed - two films that go together like peanut butter and pubic lice.The film detours into an almost Miike-like torture sequence.Perry's Madea is so annoying that about halfway through I was wishing the projector would malfunction.Emotionally satisfying (if a bit simplistic), yet Perry dilutes its potency by casting himself in ... sitcom roles.Diary of A Mad Black Woman has no idea what kind of film it wanted to be, and fails at every genre it tries to tackle.Diary is a crock, all right, but a crock made with conviction.this dismal little potboiler delivers only tediumPerry's film adaptation clearly preaches to the converted while presupposing its TV-sitcom humor will win (or convert) new fans.Darren Grant, a music vid guy making his feature debut, presents it all in a smooth, elegant package that almost disguises the fact that what we're watching is the narrative equivalent of an eight-ring circus.It's an unusual mix of vulgarity and piety.It turns on a dime from scenes of maudlin sentimentality to manic slapstick, then turns on another dime to trite Christian moralizing.One is left with the sense that while Perry has captured certain truths about human experience, he undermines himself by ignoring psychological detail in favor of big gestures and simplistic explanations.The whole thing is a melodrama; there's nothing fatally wrong with that. But the set-ups are so easy and obvious, the humor so broad and the characters such one-dimensional stereotypes that the drama is laughable.While the movie fills a much-needed niche in the lily-white Hallmark movie department, this clunky, borderline-amateur directorial effort from music-video veteran Darren Grant simply doesn't do justice to the material. In fact, it's downright awful.The film itself is a touch insane, veering from comedy to cornball melodrama (and torture!) with such startling alacrity that viewers might laugh and not know if they're supposed to.Diary of a Mad Black Woman is directed by Darren Grant, who is unable to wrangle all of Perry's attempts to entertain -- or pander to -- his audience into anything resembling a satisfying movie.The trash-talkin' Madea stuff is raunchy and fun (if you're not over that gag by now), but it's totally out of place within the high melodrama that bookends it.In an awkward split-personality way, it works some of the time.",

        "document": "Block Party makes for a transcendent experience.The music is angry and the jokes are raw but, ultimately, Block Party conveys a positive message to audiences. Instead of competition, we see collaboration between the artists and unity in the diverse crowd.Strictly for fans of the musical acts and those who think everything Chappelle does is genius.There's an intimate, just-throwing-a-party feel to the whole bash, thanks to Chappelle's pretension-puncturing humor and the sense that, whatever their issues or accomplishments, the artists are there mainly to share some love with their fans.Those who denounce rap as nothing but profanity-laden chants about living like a pimp and treating women like garbage will be surprised by the strong political messages that pepper the concert.[Chappelle is] a uniter, not a divider.Chappelle's talent and the characters in the movie give it a universal appeal, even to those unfamiliar with hip-hop.It's intermittently funny, but it peaks too soon and runs far too long. And for all its length, Block Party doesn't tell us much about Chappelle that we haven't seen before.By cutting away from the music just as things start cooking, what could have been a great rockumentary becomes too much of a Chappelle celebration.Two years after going AWOL from his hit Comedy Central show, Dave Chappelle makes a tentative foray back into the limelight with a good old-fashioned concert film that, surprisingly, features very little of Chappelle himself.Chappelle keeps things lively, joking on camera, punctuating the acts with gags , while Michel Gondry maintains our interest, focusing as much on Chappelle's energy and wit, and goings-on behind the scenes, as the gig itself.The atmosphere is genuinely infectious - the fact that the event is packed, despite pouring rain, speaks volumes.A good time should be had by all.Easily overshadowed by the musical performers, particularly The Fugees, reunited to deliver a most-moving rendition of Killing Me Softly, it is easy to understand why Dave withdrew into his shell, after watching his lame stand-up act here.Dull and repetitive. Your own reaction to it will depend a lot on how well you like these particular artists performing in concert.Gondry brings a caught-on-the-fly style to the footage that nonetheless coheres into something that feels planned, or pre-ordained.Gives off an inclusive humAs a comedy, it doesn't quite gel. As a musical it doesn't have much more luck, but as a showcase for Chappelle's talents, Block Party works just fine.Yes, there's a little preachiness here, but it doesn't puncture the party mood. Or stop Chappelle telling dirty jokes about prostitutes, for that matter. Thanks to him this isn't just a musical feast, but a rib-busting comedy too.A concert film for people who don't like concert films, Dave Chappelle's Block Party does such a good job of putting you in the middle of the action that only the end credits can remind you that you're sitting in a movie theatre.It's no Last Waltz, but this crowd-pleasing concert film offers an entertaining mix of music and comedy.Dave Chappelle's exhilarating new film chronicles a free block party that was held in 2004 on a dead-end street in the Bed-Stuy neighborhood of Brooklyn.The highlight here is watching Dave hand out Golden Tickets to average people he ran into while doing his day-to-day in Dayton....an uplifting, funny and engaging star-studded affair.It feels rangy but is also a work of expert timing.May prove to be the feel-good movie of the year...the only problem is that we can't enjoy the live performances in their entirety.It's a jubilant, civic-minded lollapalooza.The film has the pleasantly unexpected result of showcasing [Chappelle] at his most humane and relatable.Gondry not only captures the energy of the show but also treats viewers to backstage footage that's as engaging as the final concert.The mix of interviews, performances and shtick may make for a loosey-goosey movie, but its 'wish-you-had-been-there' quotient is off the chart.see Chappelle at his bestWhat should be a breezy, hand-waving romp turns out to be a misshapen, lazy flop. One moment it soothes the heart with sweet music, and the next it fries your ears with feedback.His [Chappelle] return to the public eye doesn't result in much musical magic or comedic fun.Part concert film, part documentary and part comedy, Block Party plays like a sampler of contemporary rap.Gangly, disarming and slyly witty, Chappelle is at ease with people of all ages and races, and has a knack for finding humour without forcing it....an off-the-wall celebration that mixes humor and music to amusing, if not life-changing, effect....a friendly and hugely entertaining mix of humour and music.His racial jokes have an edge, but they are not as deadly as the Chappelle's Show skits.Block Party puts Chappelle (who co-produced the movie) in the host position, and he's very funny...Block Party is a true gift.Once in a great while there's a movie that's so funny, infectious and welcoming - a movie that makes you feel so good about America and the people in it - you just want to climb inside the screen and live there.Watching the concert on screen is almost as good as being there.While the future of Chappelle's Show remains in doubt, we have his insanely funny concert film, Dave Chappelle's Block Party, to sustain us.Dave Chappelle's Block Party is a fairly disorganized film about a fairly disorganized concert, redeemed by the good feeling Chappelle sheds like a sunbeam on every scene.[Dave] Chappelle and helmer [Michel] Gondry give a real neighborhood feel to \"Block Party\" and the result is everyone got together and had a great time.There's an innocent joy and a genial detachment, as if Chappelle's playing host to his own celebrity. He's Johnny Carson-ing his fame, as it were.A good-timey vibe lasts from beginning to end of Party.Block Party is an uproarious good time, part documentary, part concert film, part who knows what?It's a joy fest.This is a concert film with real soul, message and emotion. Its coin is all too rare these days....an entertaining afternoon of ramshackle camaraderie.You don't have to be a fan of hip-hop or even of Dave Chappelle's comedy to get a huge kick out of this expansive, generous, get-up-and-dance film.Dave Chappelle's Block Party is an overwhelmingly delightful and energetic creation, welcoming the audience to come join the fun. It's impossible to resist the invitation.Dave Chappelle's Block Party is easily the most fun I've had in a movie theater in months.Infectiously fun.Dave Chappelle's Block Party confirms that he's not just instinctually funny, he has impeccable musical taste.What you'll take away from Block Party is a newfound respect for Chappelle and rap music in general.Block Party is an easygoing, loose-limbed, big-lunged celebration of, well, celebration.The directorial slackness is ably compensated for by a climactic set from the reunited Fugees.This is effectively an inner-city Woodstock -- only funny.LIke Wattstax and Festival Express before it, Chappelle and Gondry's movie makes you feel as though you're at a party when, in fact, you're just sitting in a darkened theater.You will wish you'd been invited to Dave Chappelle's Block Party, but watching the documentary about the September 2004 concert event is the next best thing.Dave Chappelle's Block Party parvient \u0155 capturer l'esprit de f\u0119te, autant celui de la mise en %u0153uvre que de l'\u00e9v\u00e9nement lui-m\u0119me, avec une efficacit\u00e9 \u0155 toute \u00e9preuve.One of the best films of the year so far, this party begins with an inspired act of generosity: Dave Chappelle handing out golden tickets to a New York block festival, featuring hip-hop's biggest acts.Because Chappelle's really digging into who people are... he has the capacity to adeptly grasp such perennial wellsprings of humor as class conflict to a degree unparalleled by modern entertainers...It looks like run-of-the-mill party videos shot by a drunk.No, it's not Shakespeare, it's not Citizen Kane, but when a movie is this funny, addictive, affectionate, energetic, uplifting and aware of the world and its people and their hearts, it is just as much a triumph.[Chappelle's] an edgy comedian, but his purpose with the concert and film is to make a diverse crowd feel comfortable with one another. More than any message, that effort is likely to be remembered.Chappelle frequently fades to the sideline as the musical groups take over, offering a blisteringly memorable snapshot of hip hop's state of the art in 2004.Gondry doesn't seriously push the visual envelope; all he's doing is assembling a souvenir, an almost great document of a party most of us missed.a winningly entertaining labor of love that also happens to be A work by everyone involvedIn a year that has already suffered from the embarrassing shuckin' and jivin' of Martin Lawrence and Tyler Perry, it's exhilarating to see a film that celebrates black culture without turning it into a minstrel show.It's impossible not to get caught up in this party's good vibe.'This is the best single day of my career,' Chappelle says at the film's end, sitting down for a quiet moment after the music and laughter have stopped. And you absolutely believe him.It's a defiant act of optimistic patriotism. This is what Dave Chappelle's America looks like, and now that we get the idea, there's no reason we can't live in it too.This is one block party you won't wanna miss.Must fun of all, however, is basking in Chappelle's ability to be effortlessly funny.A state of the hip-hop nation address that should be seen by everyone who dismisses rap music as violent, misogynistic and sociopathic.Dave Chappelle and hip-hop greats throw a party to remember.Block Party captures a communal gathering with an honesty that makes what could be a dull lack of dramatics into something spectacular.A house band provides a great blues/funk backbone for a mix of hip-hop, rap and soul. All are having so much fun, I'm not even a big fan of hip-hop but I had a great time too.More than just a concert film, Block Party is a great look into the mind of a comedian, captured at the height of his success.This picture remains faithful to the underlying affability of both Chappelle and Gondry, orchestrating a feel-good homestyle vibe that, while peppered with moments of sly political commentary, never harshes its own, slightly bittersweet mellow.A heady spirit of spontaneity permeates the proceedings, suggesting the entire pic, much like the concert it documents, was conceived, planned and completed in a single burst of creative enthusiasm.This rare sense of wonder at life's infinite possibilities is what unites Chappelle with the work of Michel Gondry, a filmmaker on unusually good terms with his inner child.Chappelle laughingly admits, 'I'm mediocre at both [comedy and music] and yet have managed to talk my way into a fortune.' I agree. This movie proves his point perfectly.Dave Chappelle's Block Party is perhaps the first concert movie since Stop Making Sense to give you a blissful buzz.Lets loose with wit and style.No one enjoys the free festivities more than Chappelle, who wanders through the film like a kid on Christmas morning. A very funny kid.A gift to both Chappelle and hip-hop fans.Chappelle invents a few routines involving the backing band that had me wiping away hysterical tears.This is truly an enjoyable movie-going experience for people of all races and ages.Block Party itself doesn't kill, exactly, but its charms are enough to disarm.A return to rowdy form.This could have been better, but I'm not sure how.While Dave Chappelle's recent tv appearances have suggested the reasons for his departure from his tv series last year, this film brings back in energetic, funny, insightful full force, surrounded by people he likes and admires.Dave Chappelle's charming, laid back style of humor, along with some fabulous female singers, made the rat-a-tat rumble of the profanity-laced rap worth enduring.The cinematic equivalent of that first beautiful day of spring ... when you can take off your coat and go to the park, bob your head with the radios playing to the open, sweet-scented air and watch the pretty girls walk by.Unique in the manner in which it salutes African-American culture and unity while at the same time exhibiting an exalted openness that makes it clear everyone's invited to take part in the merriment.Chappelle's payback to the people is a great and funny documentary-concert film.Chappelle will NOT be following Drawn TogetherA movie with good humor, good music and a positive message that isn't a complete embarrassment to watch.a slamming concert telecast that ... proves how raw hip-hop music can translate to film without missing a beat.The theme of racial self-empowerment runs throughout Dave Chappelle's Block Party. I don't think the comedian just wanted to organize a concert. I think he wanted to encourage positivity.I want to see another hour of Dave Chappelle's Block Party.This movie looks thrown together, kind of like the block party that serves as its focus. And it has all of the appeal of a spontaneous gathering of friends who, in this case, happen to be some of the biggest names in in music.the party of the year thanks to some amazing music and a very funny, very likeable hostBlock Party is entertaining from start to finish... you'll walk out of this film with a smile on your face and a few tunes stuck in your head....the gritty funnyman (Chappelle) invites us all to his specialized big event where the conscientious laughter and lyrics are symbolically joined at the soulful hip.What keeps it entertaining is Chappelle's rapier wit and God-given talent for impromptu mischief....those of you expecting wall-to-wall sketches and Charlie Murphy are going to be disappointed.There are just enough provocative notes hit for \"Block Party\" to stand out as more than just a frivolous good time (though it can be enjoyed in that way as well).While unlikely to enter the annals of great concert filmmaking, Dave Chappelle's Block Party does capture the moment at hand with a breezy, offhanded and utterly user-friendly charm.If you like the guy and the sort of music featured at his bash, give it a try. If not, give it a pass and check out Neil Young: Heart of Gold instead.Much of the all-ages, all-races appeal of comedian Dave Chappelle comes from his ability to mix both high-brow and low-brow elements into his humor.A paean to both the comfort of community and the thrill of spontaneity...Even if you're not familiar with hip-hop..., Chappelle's infectious energy makes this Block Party one you don't want to miss.reminiscent of the rockumentaries from the 1970s and 1980s which showed artists taking themselves much too seriouslyToo many great moments happen to list.",
        "summary": "Dave Chappelle's Block Party is a raucous return to the spotlight for the comic. Buoyed by Chappelle's witty, infectious humor and outstanding performances from some of the more socially conscious artists in hip-hop like Mos Def, Kayne West, the Roots, and (will wonders never cease?) the reunited Fugees, this documentary/concert film is a joyous experience. With an appealing mix like that, who doesn't want to attend this Party?",

        "document": "The story, spiked with gentle humor, moves smoothly through the standard tropes of Iranian art house cinema.While the film incorporates a touch of neo-realism, Iranian director Majid Majidi isn't aiming for miserablism; his beautifully austere morality tale is more a sun-parched version of a different well-known story.A parable of corruption, catastrophe and eventual redemption. Mr. Majidi's tale wasn't meant to be timely, of course, but the shoe fits, and the film wears it well.The film is pleasingly meandering, till the more typically Majidian soulful and teary-eyed climax.a greatly satisfying parable of happenstanceIf you can look past the almost silent-era sermonizing of The Song of Sparrows, you can see something else at work here, and deeper things on view.[Director] Majidi is a master director of tear-jerkers, and he proves true to form with Sparrows.As unabashedly sentimental as The Song of Sparrows often becomes, this simple fable of a righteous man's relationship to his family, his community and most of all his faith has the force of conviction.Another gem about spiritual renewal by the great and sensitive Iranian director Majid Majidi.Majid Majidi's lyrical, gently comic The Song of Sparrows grounds its low-key humor in the realities of poor, semi-rural Iranian life.It's a homily about the ethically and spiritually corrupting influence of the city, and of that milieu's capitalist ethos, straight out of an Industrial Revolution-era sermon.It's likable, but missable.The images in The Song of Sparrows have a poetic grace that's to be desired in storytelling.With this simple story of real-life comedy and drama, plus those small moral decisions we face every day, Majidi gives us a warmly involving and entertaining look at the earthy humanity of life in IranA touching tearjerker that's also a celebration of traditional values against the dehumanizing tendencies of modern urban life...with even the most obvious moments saved by an underlying sweetness and poignancy.Achingly poetic in a way that recalls the Italian neo-realism of The Bicycle Thief.[A]stonishes with me its simplicity, its uncomplicated wisdom, its visual salience...The lessons are unsubtle and the pace drags near the end, but Naji is wonderfully expressive, the production design is top-notch and the Iranian countryside is gorgeous.It's sweet and has some sublime, poetic moments....a very satisfying, sobering and hopeful film...At times funny, sad, poignant and suspenseful, Sparrows is a showcase for Majidi's masterful storytelling -- and Naji's superb acting.At times tedious but ultimately beguiling, Song of Sparrows morphs from a sly dramedy about running a household into a fable about two ways of life (urban and rural) that can't coexist.[A] lovely, metaphoric tale about not letting the things you own, own you.Moving and entertaining in a modest way...it's nice to have a reminder that America doesn't have a monopoly on sweetly uplifting movies about life lessons.People of faith will see divinity in The Song of Sparrows, and the rest of us the presence of something greater than ourselves, a perfection that can only be understood in observation of another person's life.President Ahmadinejad should take a lesson on kindness from this sweet Iranian film.Beautifully crafted, often sentimental, sometimes humorous pic.The story is so well told that the symbolism supports rather than sustains the plot.Occasionally drags, but feels refreshingly down-to-earth and has enough gentle humor, striking visuals and thought-provoking use of symbolism to be mostly compelling and amusing.The Song of Sparrows is a sweet and uplifting humanistic fable that celebrates the joys of community and pastoral life over a harried and materialistic urban existence.This is the fourth collaboration for Naji and Majidi, and the actor and director feed off each other creatively, pushing the boundaries of the characters each time.A leisurely and lovely picture, well worth seeing.From a cross-cultural perspective \"The Song of Sparrows\" gives essential voice to the impoverished peasants of rural Iran.The goldfish flopping in the sun is an image typical of Majid Majidi's films, fable-like and seemingly simple even as it is also complex.takes place a half a world away in a land of ostrich farms and refrigerators delivered...on the back of a motorbike, but Karim's foibles, his worries and joys, will be recognizable to anyone...It is somehow congenial to feel that we are watching a tale that could have been told elsewhere.Delicate and sturdy.",

It's about the inability in all of us to make sense of our lives, put it all together and come up with something meaningful.[Fellini] is that rare sort of artist who can be loved, revered and just barely tolerated, all at the same time.Amiably spiking all criticism through a gloomy scriptwriter mouthpiece, Fellini pulls a multitude of rabbits out of the showman's hat.a true masterpiecehe effect is sometimes confusing -- but always beautiful -- and eventually intertwines to a singular life-confirming realisation that cuts through the madness and embraces it.Its opening [has] perhaps the greatest dream scene of all: Marcello Mastroianni's Guido stifled in a silent traffic jam, onlookers gazing blankly at him as he rises through the sunroof of his car, high into the sky. The rest of the film isn't too shabby.[A] brilliant, sumptuous semi-autobiographical account of the creative process.The ensuing decades have brought forth a deluge of bogus masterpieces, and Fellini's, by comparison, holds up rather well.If a Fellini fan, this one is a must see.A marvellous and immensely personal piece of self analysis, which journeys into the heart, mind and soul of its illustrious director, Frederico Fellini.A carnival of the soul.Marcello Mastroianni becomes an avatar for the great Italian director Federico Fellini in the surreal cinematic self-interrogation that takes place in 8 1/2.It exerts an irresistible pull.This is a complex and painfully honest study of a man in a personal and professional crisis.At least half-kidding most of the time, it's a playful nervous breakdown, alight with ideas and joy.8 1/2 is probably the most potent movie about film-making, within which fantasy and reality are mixed without obfuscation, and there's a tough argument that belies Fellini's usual felicitous flaccidity.A sprawling anything-goes portrait of the artist and the creative process in crisis.In terms of execution I cannot remember a more brilliant film.A seminal work of cinema.a wonderfully self-indulgent meditation on creative blocks and personal crises8 1/2 is widely regarded as Federico Fellini's masterpiece, though it is an abstract admittance of failure. (The film, however, has few faults it does not itself admit - a benefit of a film containing its own critic).Here is a piece of entertainment that will really make you sit up straight and think, a movie endowed with the challenge of a fascinating intellectual game.One of the undisputed classics of modern international film.Most overrated film of all time.Fellini's flights into the surreal are his self-examination and confession. Alas, unlike Bergman, his confession is without moral rigor; he wants to be indulged, not absolved.Astute beyond words.Fellini was so incredibly creative that when he was mentally blocked, he turned his inner struggle into a phenomenal masterpiece of introspection.Fellini's manic, larger-than-life 8 1/2 rules as the king of all Italian movies.8 1/2 is the best film ever made about filmmaking.",

        "document": "It stumbles from scene to scene, theme to theme and trope to trope. If you want it to make sense, however, you're out of luck.The movie's well-acted. Almost everything else about \"Country Strong\" is weak.This less show than tell, sudsy when not bland make-believe musical can best be described as a, well, bad hear day. And likewise full length feature promos for a couple of actresses suddenly turned singers.An insight-free showcase for haphazard clich\u00e9s, with a title that sounds like deodorant for cowboys.[A] deeply, dangerously earnest take on truth and beauty in trouble.It shows that Gwyneth knows the spangly high-powered joys of country music. Too bad that in Country Strong, she's too busy acting out the hysterical and mostly nonsensical sorrows.\"Country Strong\" is one of the best movies of 1957, and I mean that sincerely as a compliment.Ultimately it's too meandering and uneven to ever truly tug at your heart.Both sincere and cynical in its view of country stardom, it makes you forgive all of its false notes simply because the talent plays them with conviction.Several good performances are left adrift, as the characters roam from scene to scene, singing (quite well) as they go. Even as a sort of long-form music video, it's disjointed.[T]here's solid workmanship and an authentic emotional muscle in this movie. I was startled to find myself overwhelmed, eventually, by its ragged charms and its rough-edged vision of female power and pain...Boozing, cheating, weeping, backstabbing, pill-popping -- Country Strong plays more like a honky-tonk jukebox than a movie.[A] mixed bag of a country music comeback fable.If the point of Country Strong was to prove that Gwyneth Paltrow can sing, then mission accomplished. You don't need to sit through this two-hour melodrama to confirm that.Feste struggles mightily to instill meaning and grandeur in Country Strong, but her initial efforts to sidestep clich\u00e9 often result in confusion before she simply gives up and opts for melodrama.The world of Pandora was more believable than this whitewash.Like the overwrought lyrics of a classic country ballad, Country Strong is movie manipulation of the highest orderThe film is very depressing and melancholy that you have a hard time finding the entertainment factor. That is until you get the music.Much like the deservedly-maligned \"Burlesque\" with Cher and Christina Aguilera, \"Country Strong\" is merely a trite story that gives Paltrow and her co-stars a chance to show off their vocals.January is always a tough month for movies. Unfortunately, \"Country Strong\" just made it that much tougher.Country Strong stumbles, and has some slack in its silences, but it takes its world, characters and songcraft seriously...Most of the effort seems to have gone into the original music, which is pleasant but not memorable, and too little on creating believable, multidimensional characters.Even a Paltrow fan (I remain one) would have to concede that her willowy frame and perfect skin do not betray a lifetime of vodka-swilling and throwing up in hillbilly bars.As predictable and soulless as an over-produced country power ballad.Paltrow is a poster girl for the virtues of yoga and a macrobiotic diet - which makes her far too healthy-looking to play the troubled, booze-sodden singer at the heart of [this] sudsy romantic melodrama.No saving grace here.Some killer tunes plus a genuinely believable turn from Glee star Paltrow make Country Strong a show worth catching.The good news is that Paltrow can sing; the bad news is the mawkish and one-paced drama she's playing in.The backstage shenanigans and tear-stained soap opera are all too predictable in Country Strong but the performances lend it conviction and the soundtrack has enough heart and soul to endear it to true country music fans.This is a cheesy soap opera that dearly wants to be a country and western All About Eve. The songs aren't too bad; the dialogue is.For me it's a no.I hated, loved, hated the movie. In that order.More country pop than country classic, Country Strong puts its characters through the dramatic wringer ... but only skims the surface of their emotional minefields.It almost works as a decent if familiar story of comebacks and setbacks -- but then one bottle goes crashing against the wall and the emotional investment all but flies out the window.Keeps Gwyneth Paltrow in an irritating state of teary distress, and makes one long for the same numbing cell of bottle-clutching isolation that alcoholism gifts to the lead character.As far as I can tell, the moral of Country Strong seems to be: mothers, don't let your kids grow up to sing country music. Good advice. That said, the music is easily the best part of the movie, and I don't even like country music.Why do I have to listen to Meester caterwaul throughout the movie and Tim McGraw (one of the biggest music stars on the planet) doesn't even pick up a guitar?It just lacks coherence, that's all. Oh, and a point. Oh, and any sense of fun. Oh, and a guy who looks like Heath Ledger in Brokeback Mountain -- no, wait, it has that, never mind.If you like a spectacle, whoo boy, you have found your perfect match.It's too bad that Ms. Feste didn't ditch the female victim bit and make a movie about a survivor....incompetent filmmaking with nonsensical narrative jump cuts, silly dialogue and characters who sway from one extreme to the other with no central balancing emotional core.So filled with mixed messages, misguided plot turns, and consecutive false denouements that, by the actual end, it finally comes off as nothing but an infuriating betrayal.Hedlund has a surprisingly rich singing voice, the mahogany tones giving depth and stature to an under-written character.\"Country Strong\" comes to spontaneous life from time to time, despite maudlin devices and manipulative set pieces.But holy \"Coal Miner's Daughter,\" the results are borderline disastrous, unintentionally funny and strung together with canned parodies of country music.When it's not forcing you to stifle a laugh, there are moments when the unwavering sincerity of the cast add up to some decent scenes.What saves \"Country Strong\" from drowning in its own tears are the leads, all four of whom imbue Feste's unabashedly clich\u00e9d script with some genuine humanity.If you're going to make a bad film, at least make it short.There's so much going on in \"Country Strong,\" with a new theme or plotline emerging every 10 minutes or so, that it feels like an entire season of a TV series has been crammed into two hours.\"Country Strong\" is a title that calls to mind a pickup truck. Only in a work of science-fiction would it suffice as a description of Gwyneth Paltrow.The musical numbers offer some of the strongest moments in \"Country Strong.\" The story's offstage dramas, however, are like a country song with every other verse removed.The many tunes in Country Strong are of such astounding banality, it's as if they were written by caged chimps as they were driven through Nashville on the way to a medical research lab.While the melodrama is ladled on fast and thick at times, it is performed with sufficient conviction that we are drawn in rather than left on the outside laughing at it.Gwyneth Paltrow is a beautiful, gifted actress with a lovely singing voice, but she's never been more miscast than she is in Country Strong.Patsy Cline. Loretta Lynn. Gwyneth Paltrow.This country music drama boasts solid performances and a few catchy songs, but its ending might have you singing the blues.A movie that isn't smart enough to realize how stupid it really is.This overlong melodrama has all the dramatic grace of a wrecked-my-truck, lost-my-girl song-and about as much emotional heft.You watch \"Country Strong\" wishing you were watching \"Crazy Heart,\" and wondering whether Gwyneth Paltrow read the script all the way through, and wishing Bridges would turn up to show the folks how it's done.That rare ensemble piece in which all four principals are not only compellingly drawn but handled with an astute sense of dramatic balance.A country music drama with a big heart but not enough focus, Country Strong tackles fame, artistic expression, addiction and love, although none of them deeply enough.Feste could do with less cowbell.Doesn't come close to matching any of the legion of films set in the country music world, from \"Coal Miner's Daughter\" to \"Walk the Line\" to \"Crazy Heart.\"Maybe if you love the music it doesn't matter what the story is, but it does show irresponsible lack of restraint dealing with serious drama.Themes and cliches plucked from countless country lyrics fuel a thoroughly unconvincing show business story about a larger-than-life, crash-and-burn star and her unruly entourage of self-serving personalities.There are some lovely songs, and a handful of great ideas, just dying to bust out of Country Strong, but the cream gravy that coats every corner of this chicken-fried Valley of the Dolls smothers almost everything it can.A rare specimen in our postironic age: legitimately unintentional camp.Shana Feste's screenplay seldom rises above the level of daytime TV; the only actor who triumphs over her trite dialogue is Tim McGraw in a nonsinging role as Paltrow's husband and manager.If Feste actually believes that this show is country nirvana, she has no business making a country movie.Country Strong weak in the story department.The story's shifting perspectives and sympathies (the distinctions between the 'authentic' singer-songwriter and the 'pop' vocalist prove ambiguous) result in a music-centric work that feels more honest (while being less entertaining) than 'Crazy Heart.'A perplexing blend of threadbare narrative tropes assembled without any imagination or, crucially, any fun.Oh, my goodness. It's the first Lifetime Movie Network flick to hit the big screen![B]y the time Country Strong ends, it has largely defeated the feel-good buzz from its subplots involving puppy love and charity.The downer plot with a predictable ending never rises above television tearjerker movie of the week, but the songs are enough to recommend to fans of this genre.Hedlund's got a hell of a voice, rotgut-ragged, and whether he's crooning or wooing, whatever he's selling, and no matter how cornpone, I'm buying.A fairly turgid new drama that is anything but subtle, anything but surprising, but somehow it's truthful and honest, and the characters get under your skin.Disappointing country music drama that fails to hit the required emotional high notes, thanks to a confused, clich\u00e9-riddled script, poor direction and an unconvincing performance from a badly miscast Gwyneth Paltrow.Writer/director Shana Feste is clearly indebted to the Oscar-winning Crazy Heart and Robert Altman's epic Nashville, but the script all too often stumbles into mediocre soap-opera territory.C&W lovers will lap it up - look out for some stellar Nashville cameos - and there's big-lunged uplift to see you through the cornball plot turns.Paltrow gives it her best but is so conspicuously doing country. We're meant to believe she has spent half her life staring into a vodka bottle, but she glows like she's just stepped out of a yoga retreat.Like last year's Crazy Heart, this film traces the journey of a struggling addict country singer. And while the film is somewhat sentimental and simplistic, it features some strong acting that manages to draw us in.This enjoyably OTT drama-with-songs-in-it was monstered in January by American reviewers, who were maybe expecting a highbrow, subtle and meditative drama in which Gwyneth Paltrow is an alcoholic banjo player.With so many storylines battling for supremacy, Country Strong never conveys who these people are and is often inconsistent in portraying them.A decade after Duets, a singing Gwyn proves she can still reach the high notes. Shame the melodrama plays strained and unoriginal.There are real issues here that need to be explored -- the neurosis of fame and its consequent personal and relational stresses -- but Country Strong gives them only surface treatment.Strong in intent but wobbles under the lights.Misconceptions concerning show biz, rehab and addiction abound in this disappointing melodrama about a country megastar on a downward spiral. But its fine cast is not to blame.If not for the music, Country Strong would barely be a wimper at your neighborhood multiplex.It's a relief when Paltrow's character bursts into song. That's the only time when she's not pitching fits to beat the band ... making the band, and the audience, extremely grateful.The soundtrack includes mostly new tunes, but the only country song that kept racing through my increasingly bored mind was Willie Nelson's \"Wake Me When It's Over.\"Every actor does a good job, but they rely on songs to tell a story instead of the screenplay. And I have no idea why I would root for any of them.The engaging cast in Country Strong helps us almost forget about Shana Feste's disappointing script and irrational ending.It all gets more and more ridiculous as event piles up on event, leading to a turn of melodramatic excess that defines a new sort of pornography that has nothing to do with sex, but is obscene nonethelessRemember when country music meant something to narrative filmmaking, when a tortured, soulful song put to film could document the doubts and dimensions of an entire generation?Catchy tunes, robust performances--but you can see every backstage-melodrama-cliche coming two scenes away.Paltrow's got the pipes, but Garrett Hedlund steals Country Strong out from under her.When the starting point is a world in which even the toughest guys wear their hearts on their sleeves, the trick for filmmakers is how to walk the line without getting stuck in the muck, and that is a problem the filmmaker hasn't yet figured out.Paltrow and McGraw are good, and so is the music, but Garrett Hedlund is the breakout star!For a script that promotes artistry over stardom, love over fame, Country Strong falls back on cinematic tropes that saddle the film with an unfortunate predictability.Gwyneth Paltrow must be a great actress because, as country singer Kelly Canter in Country Strong, she seems totally unaware of her insurmountable blandness.The movie isn't worth the scuffed cowgirl boots it's scooting around in.A bizarre cut that finds Kelly and Beau riding a freight train just adds to the sensation that we're witnessing a film career off its rails.Country Strong is a country music melodrama, but I'm not sure which country. Certainly not one with a Deep South region where songs come from the heart, not radio trending surveys, and where folks know the smell of manure means don't step in it.The plot is like a bad country song that just wants to pile on the heartbreak and the clich\u00e9s.... wallows in the weepy glitz of country music ... without once tapping into its true grit.Unfortunately weak.Corny and cliched...Country Strong's downfall stems from its almost egregiously deliberate pace...It's got enough melodrama and full-volume diva-meltdown histrionics to blow a movie like Burlesque out of the water.Not exactly brimming with the essence of country musicSome may cynically scoff at Country Strong's rollercoaster of feelings, yet it's almost completely appropriate considering the high drama present in the lyrics of country music.This canned corn falls far short of the inspiring story of triumph and tragedy it wants viewers to buy.Though the plot is almost formulaic, \"Country Strong\" has two things going for it: talented actors and great musicA rawer, realer, and far more believable and compelling portrait of a self-destructive country artist's attempt at recovery than CRAZY HEART.A little like modern country music - odd moments of sincerity, heart and authenticity peek through the plastic, the hype and the manufactured hokum.While Paltrow belts out the title anthem with conviction, it is the younger performers who sing more intimate, and moving, numbers that advance the story rather than merely stating it.Feste captures the heightened reality of performing before a massive crowd, when audience expectations and JumboTron screens can blow delicate emotions up to monstrous proportions.

        "document": "Howard slowly escalates the tension to an unexpected but deeply satisfying pay-off, and the film's final scenes demonstrate yet again that he is one of the few mainstream directors who can make dramatic symbolism work on a big canvas.The true dilemma of this misguided seriocomedy lies in the filmmakers' confusion as to whether they're making a side-splitting bromance (nope) or an unsparing, warts-and-all look at screwed-up relationships (sort of).Even though The Dilemma fails as a whole, there's enough ethical brain teasing and character-based conflict to warrant an unenthusiastic recommendation.\"The Dilemma\" is never dull, but it's also a mess.Suffers from the mistaken impression that it's a comedy. Instead, it's merely a template for comedy, handed to a group of people who obviously had no idea what to do with it.The latest comedy to explore the ethics of male friendships, The Dilemma relies on the enthusiastic performances of its unique cast to see it through.The problem is that, like its primary characters, the film itself is emotionally damaged, trying too hard to be likeable and coming across too serious and dysfunctional for its own good.A dark spirit pervades this Vince Vaughn/Kevin James buddy movie that stifles laughter.The Dilemma is quite enjoyable until its characters stop behaving like rational adults and start acting like they've just realised they've got a film to finish.It deals with a serious issue of problems in a marriage, but it does so in such an ignorant, clumsy, sophomoric way with a sexist point of view that it loses any value, either morally or in terms of entertainment.Lacking any great surprises, this story meanders along trying to prolong the dilemma for as long as possible.Unsettling and so off tone that we wonder if we are supposed to be laughing at this at all.Director Ron Howard, usually a surer touch behind the camera, seems out of his element here, unable to bring anything into clear comedic focus.The story may wander, and bears none of Howard's usual hallmarks, but the talent involved ensures The Dilemma offers more than just your average date movie.The man who grew up on sitcoms and then made agreeable diversions like Splash and Parenthood seems to have lost his comedic touch.Shockingly dark, the focus of \"The Dilemma\" is less about cheap laughs and more about the absurd humor of existential loneliness.This film is familiar territory to director Howard (\"Parenthood\") but, as always, he finds a way to get the right performances from his actors...Even for an experienced director like Howard, there are just too many problems to get around.The Dilemma for audiences is whether they would appreciate this slight, threadbare film but for the indefatigable energy of Vince Vaughn?Howard tries desperately to balance the comedy against the screenplay's tense domestic melodrama ... and mostly fails.A movie that struggled to find a name never chooses a tone.The Dilemma marks the latest step in Ron Howard's attempt to recapture his past glory as a populist filmmaker, and apparently that involves making a terrible Vince Vaughn comedy.The filmmakers just don't know what to do about the ladies.I realize it's only January, but The Dilemma is already in the running for worst movie of the year. It will be a hard one to top. Or bottom.Catch your best friend's significant other cheating do you confront them? Ignore it? Or like Ron Howard, make your dilemma into a two-hour comedy and name it The Dilemma.If you're in the mood for some Vince Vaughn fast talking that's better than average, The Dilemma will work for you.Meant to bridge the gap between chick flick and frat house fare, it is bound to annoy both intended audiences...A morality play about friendship and telling the truth that fizzles into a sour and tedious comedy.Do you trust this movie to tackle the issue with fairness and brains?The Dilemma requires a director willing to indulge the dark comedy to its fullest. One name that style doesn't bring to mind for the job is Ron Howard.Surely this balancing act involving both heartbreak and humor will polarize those who would prefer that the film stick to one or the other.Some great chemistry between the central duo is undone by a plot that is so frustrating you will want to chew off your arm. It's so frustrating that the ending is a palpable relief.In spite of the talent, The Dilemma misfiresFeels like a throwaway effort by everyone involved.An intriguing marital dramedy that rides the line between great and awful, often undone by lazy editing....far too sedate and uneven to make a wholeheartedly positive impact on the viewer.The Dilemma is built upon an inherently false premise. In its heart it knows this, so it expends all sorts of energy trying to throw sand in the eyes of viewers, obscuring this fact for the sake of 'zaniness.'The male leads look comfortable in roles that approximate to their usual comic personas and each deliver chuckle-worthy moments.The Dilemma is steadfast in its blockheaded moral code, one optimized for maximum pratfalls and foolishness....so aggravating, that is so stupid in its set-up and narrative execution that it makes you want to throw things.A very poor effort from a talented group of people, this is a terrible movie wrapped in a glossy package.This dilemma -- and its resolution -- feels real and true, even when it's playing things for laughs.The January movie burial ground claims another victim. RIP.Friendship comedy veers into serious territory.Can we ever truly know someone? Can we even answer the question? Probably not, but The Dilemma gets credit for trying.Torn between establishing itself as a bromantic comedy or a relationship potboiler, the movie meets the requirements of neither. It is unsatisfying in general.How did Ron Howard get attached to this train wreck of a movie? Howard's track record as a director has been hit or miss... but never this deeply, disturbingly miss.The script by Allan Loeb careens all over the place without ever coming to rest on anything interesting.Allan Loeb's sharp script throws up enough complications and smartly rounds out the characters... to ensure the tension is sustained without upsetting the juggling act of laughs and life lessons.Cack-22....clumsy, unfunny, disgracefully sexist.There are more laughs in SCHINDLER'S LISTIt's safe and boringEnds with 20 minutes of apologies, a round robin of regret that downshifts the film's sputtering energy into park.A surprisingly honest take on relationships with terrific performances by the four leads. A shame it has been mis-advertised as a wacky comedy, because it is much better than that.Ron Howard delivers an unconventional romantic comedy that's actually about something.The only thing missing from this slight comedy of misunderstandings is Mr. Furley - and a scene set in the Regal Beagle.It's about as crappy as the trailers make it seem- and if you found them as painful to sit through as I did, you should avoid this like the plague.Let's have a toast for Vince Vaughn, shall we?This excruciating exercise in indecision sometimes feels like a glum comedy, sometimes like a silly drama. But it never, ever achieves anything like a coherent, consistent tone.Bromances being what they are, Vince's sharp pang of disappointment might have been worth pursuing but, Ron Howard being who he is, not a chance.Oh, there's a dilemma all right -- your choices are clunky comedy or fumbled drama in this new Vince Vaughn vehicle.There may have been a very good comedy in this scenario, or even a serious drama, but all we end up in here is no man's -- and no laughs -- land.The film is hardly a disaster. It has some effective comedy and a sense of reality but it's not the kind of engrossing package that Ron Howard usually delivers.The Dilemma is directed by Ron Howard, a man who can be relied on never to miss an obvious move. Yet, the film just keeps getting darker and darker, and Vaughn keeps pushing it that way.There is some good drama in the resolution, but this ain't the drama version. They had their chance to make a drama and they made the wrong choice.This isn't a date movie... unless it's a blind date that you realized you didn't like during dinner and want to ensure there will be no second date.A risky failure: a Ron Howard-directed so-called buddy comedy with Vince Vaughn and Kevin James that evolves into a weird, clumsy psychodrama about adultery, addiction and dishonesty.Who ever thought that Ron Howard could make a cult film? This movie is a mess, but it's an intelligent and affecting mess.Is it too soon to pronounce something 'the worst film of the year?'A sour and tiresome comedy...A humourless mess.A comedy without laughs, and a drama without tension.Clearly director Ron Howard (Cocoon, Frost/ Nixon) was striving to make a black comedy drama, but instead has created a film that's merely cynical and depressing.A not so bad bromance.Vaughan's behaviour is so crass and silly as to lack credibility.Yes, there are a handful of interesting insights into friendship but when the film aims for funny it falls flat and the faltering romance between Vaughn and Connelly is never developed nearly enough to make us care.This collapses into comic mayhem, falling-out-of-trees slapstick, snore-bore misunderstandings and a sizeable distance between laughs.Where's the comedy that has been promised to us for months and months? The Dilemma is meaner and more dramatic than I was anticipating, and more than it should be.While Vaughn proves he's still got the fast-talking bravado that makes him so bewilderingly watchable, neither his quick wit nor his chemistry with Kevin James can transform \"The Dilemma\" into the gold standard of buddy comedies.You'd think there'd be room in a 118-minute semi-comedy for more comedy, but apparently not.If you must see \"The Dilemma,\" see it on a plane.Though The Dilemma refers to a singular predicament, the film miscalculates its total number of problems ... particularly with regard to its grab-bag of styles running throughout.There's no \"Dilemma\" here at all - just a simple disappointment.There is much to say about the love that, except in comedies, dare not speak its name - the kind between straight men. \"The Dilemma\" says enough of it to be interesting.As painful as the scenes are in which these four people try to figure out how to move forward, there's also plenty of humor because the characters' reactions feel like the way real people might behave in embarrassing situations.The Dilemma is a disappointing misfire.Mediocrity hangs thick around The Dilemma, like a fog hugging a beach....stretches patience, common sense, and anyone's ability to stomach Vince Vaughn rambling his way through an eternally long two hours.The Dilemma never stops being a movie, and never starts being a good one.It's clear when a film is being tonally dishonest with itself, and this is what overpowers the positive traits that the film has to offer.As it is, The Dilemma just feels like a big bowl full of ingredients that never makes the jump to a finished recipe.A dismal dramedy in which the comic bits aren't funny, the more serious parts heavy-handed and contrived, and the scenes that try to mix the two tonally muddled.Kristen Wiig plays a character on Saturday Night Live that can't keep a secret. Man, could this movie have used her.Universal Pictures is pushing Ron Howard's new film as an all-star comedy. For me it's about a 2-starrer.Those expecting a trademark Vince Vaughn Wedding Crashers-style laughfest will be disappointed-and those who hate Vince Vaughn Wedding Crashers-style laughfests will be surprisingly impressed.Dilemma rests on the same structural foundation as episodes of Three's Company, when Mr. Roper thought he heard shenanigans through the kitchen door. A simple conversation would clear things up.What \"The Dilemma\" ultimately does best is create a platform for Vaughn to drag that iconic character of his into full-blown adulthood.A few months back, director Ron Howard started catching flack with GLAAD when trailers for his newest film included Vince Vaughn calling a car 'gay.' He better be prepared for heavy artillery fire when people actually see the whole movie.While it feels a bit unbalanced at times, The Dilemma still proves to be a sincerely clever comedy.The Dilemma never quite finds the right tonal balance, although its dramatic moments are certainly more potent than its comedic ones.Likely to please no one, neither the comedy seekers drawn in by James and Vaughn's mugs on the poster or the more sophisticated grown-ups who hear the movie is darker than you expect.The real dilemma in the sadly unfunny \"The Dilemma\" is that several different movies are going on in director Ron Howard's first nondrama in 11 years.There is a dark but funny, likable but truthful movie that could be made from this material, maybe even with the same cast. But best efforts or not, The Dilemma isn't quite it....this is quite a bit more engaging and emotionally challenging than one had much reason to expect.Ron Howard has made some great films. \"The Dilemma\" is not one of them.A comedy that seems terrified to acknowledge its darker, more sinister self, it's like an overmedicated patient or an addict in dread of relapse.Amusing romantic comedy about how the titular dilemma nearly torpedoes the relationships that bond two upwardly mobile Chicago couples.Conversations about relationships and business are couched in the language of American sport: game seven; playoffs; red zones; end zones; sports stars; ice hockey. Is this the only way men can talk to each other?The film isn't without its flaws - it's inconsistent, and characters seem to drop in and out - but its serious treatment of its characters and their problems makes it much better than it probably has any right to be.A Titanic wreck that makes you wonder if anyone was at the helm. The plot's lost in a Bermuda triangle of exhausted-formula, genre-muddle and hackneyed storytelling. Bromance, dark drama, slapstick, and rambling, wanna-be-funny speeches get mixed up.As cumbersome and drawn out as a slowly deflating tire, this cinematic collision between Vaughn's celebrated funny-surly persona and Howard's earnest pedigree is a bore -- and a serious miscalculation.Howard Tries to Have Fun with a Touchy Subject But the Good Drama Gets in the Way of his Lame Jokes.Rather less fun than a badly executed coronary bypass.Finding humor in this humorless situation is The Dilemma.There are some laughs and pleasures to be found here.This cinematic collision between Vince Vaughn's celebrated funny-surly persona and Ron Howard's earnest pedigree is a bore -- and a serious miscalculation.Hollywood gloss will paper over a few of The Dilemma's problems but you'll leave the cinema more feeling indifferent than anything else.The film retreats from its troubling message about the mystery of human nature and turns into a conventional celebration of male friendship. Vaughn is clearly prepared to push himself further, but Howard can be relied upon to play it safeThe ugly emotional mess is so respectfully handled that the story resonates far beyond its comic designs.Good performances in an interesting attempt that ultimately fails. Wrong fit for director Ron Howard.Unfortunately, Ronny and Nick's bromance takes over, and James has neither the comedy chops or wildness to keep up with Vaughn.The film spends too long dancing around the problem's possibilities, but barely addresses the potential of the solution.The failure to establish which world these characters live in becomes more problematic as the film goes on.What distinguishes The Dilemma ... is its resounding unfunnyness, its emotional dishonesty, and the general unlikability of its cast of characters.\"The Dilemma\" doesn't have the nerve to explore the movie's downbeat soul, and settles for cheese and slapstick.It's rare for a director as reliably down-the-middle as Ron Howard to let his movies go too far out on a limb, but The Dilemma is a wild ride, thrilling when it isn't a calamity.The movie is not all that deep, but it does go further than many of its kind in acknowledging the hurt and difficulty that are the deep wellsprings of any comedy worthy of the name.It waits around for the chatty Vaughn to decide what he's going to do, ping-ponging between mean humor and bland sentimentality. The one bright spot? The performance of Channing Tatum.There are lackluster movies Vince Vaughn can charm into being better. There are mediocre scripts Ron Howard can will some life into. The Dilemma just isn't one of themA Dilemma in more ways than one.A lack of focus leaves this film neither funny enough to be a comedy nor astute enough to be a drama. Although it's clearly trying to be both, there's nothing about the story or characters that grabs our attention.Such defining efforts as Cocoon and Apollo 13 seem light years away for Ron Howard...Badly written, poorly directed and painfully low on laughs, The Dilemma struggles to find the right tone and ultimately fails to convince on an emotional level...If it had been a complete drama or a complete comedy it would have been a better film. The schizoid approach just didn't work.The tone flits, sometimes uncomfortably, from Vaughn-fuelled laugh-fest to relationship drama, but it's a winner compared to many of the clunkly comedies out there.It lacks faith in its story, characters and audience.Perhaps the late Blake Edwards could have found a balance between slapstick and psychodrama, but Ron Howard can't get the pacing right, and Allan Loeb's script is even wordier than the one he wrote for Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps.Among Howard's infrequent misfires, this is one of the most disappointing.Director Ron Howard and the gifted actors are defeated by a misguided film, which suffers from identity crisis, disappointing as a male buddy comedy and/or more serious account of the nature and limitations of friendhsip.At the very least, I can now say that I know what \"lady wood\" is.How are the mighty fallen...unavoidably second-rate...a likable guy goes completely bonkers, and it isn't funny...Tatum charmingly steals his scenes with Vaughn, revealing how limited the actor is...Definitely aimed at males, the movie is quite misogynistic.Ron Howard movies inspire that rare kind of allergic reaction: They're so unremarkable they're actually frustrating.[Vince] Vaughn and [Kevin] James usually headline comedies that aim low and achieve little, but The Dilemma aims high and somehow achieves even less.Ostensibly a comedy, this movie can't quite decide what it wants to be when it grows up.The introspective themes aren't fleshed out to their fullest potential, but it's interesting to watch Howard depict bothered people with a semi-lighthearted tone, instilling the film with a promising, if unfulfilled gravitas.Heads toward easy jokes and easier sentiment, with a side of painful product placement.The jokes, when and where they can be found, are puerile, and continually give Vaughn the movie-star catbird seat.A film with an identity crisis: an awkward hybrid of comedy and drama that's never sure of which avenue to pursue.This is the sort of set-up that would have been perfectly nailed in a single episode of Friends.A suspenseless marathon of misguided male loyalty. Nothing's funny. Nothing's real.Despite flashes of insight and humour, The Dilemma's ham-fisted mishmash of bromantic set pieces and warts-and-all relationship drama makes for uneasy viewing.The pejorative use of the word \"gay\" that got The Dilemma in hot water is still in the movie, and stands as one of its funnier lines. Not that there's anything right about that.One would not think that an issue of infidelity, a main character struggling with addiction and a flailing business proposition would be the recipe for a laugh riot.Even with veteran director Ron Howard behind the camera, proceedings too often veer off in the wrong direction.Junk-food cinema in its most elementary form. If you're lucky you'll have forgotten everything about this film by the time you leave the building.Pious, intense and often hectoringly implausible, the movie runs on empty while making loud \"vroom-vroom\" sounds.It's just a failure, full stop.",

        "document": "Like an actual State of the Union address, there is nothing in State of the Union you haven't encountered already....going for the hip hop-loving teen market (both city and suburbs) that is more than willing to drop big money on flashy hubcaps, flavor-of-the-month CDs and crappy movies.There isn't a fresh moment in the entire 100-minute running time. The tediousness is impossible to dispel.The plot swings between pathetically implausible and aggressively stupid.If this sequel is any indication, the next XXX will be subtitled 'Bigger, Louder, Dumber.'The stunts and explosions are effective, but the dialogue and characters are not.This flashy atrocity, clearly a lost cause from the first five minutes, offers viewers no option but to assume crash position and brace themselves for the worst.The only thing that really matters is whether the action scenes push the envelope -- and they don't, especially compared with the extreme sports style of the first XXX.Like the original, it's ultra loud and often looks like a PlayStation game. But when the fast and furious bludgeoning and blow-ups wane, the screen may as well be tuned to channel zero.This new XXX has a story that may break all recent records for rampaging cliches and utter nonsense.[I]t is certainly true that there is Not A Lot Of Talking [here]... because it would only interfere with the unbelievable number of vehicle explosions...It's sterile, juvenile, brazenly bad. It will make money. It will be forgotten by the time you get to the bathroom.Its action scenes are too absurd and too computer-generated to produce any kind of rush. The dialogue, not just amateurish, fails even to approximate something resembling human interaction.A crisp adventure that grows increasingly audacious (the story climaxes with a huge battle waged in the Capitol) if only lightly enjoyable.It's even louder and dumber than the first XXX (2002), but if watching things fall down and go boom in a very big way makes you cheer, you're in luck.So devoid of craft, it looks as though it were filmed by robots.You'd need a crane to suspend your disbelief.Implausible actioner too noisy and clunky.Call it Seven Days in May I Please Have a Screenplay?I don't know about the state of the union, but the state of this movie franchise is gosh-awful.Peter Strauss is taking a few moments from his busy schedule of gardening with Miracle Gro, which evidently is not miraculous enough to conjure the \"w\" in \"grow.\"This is that rare B movie that's rooted in gut-level stirrings of power and retaliation.A completely generic action film with nothing to hold your attention and no one for you to care about.crrrrrrrrrrrrrrrAP!A self-consciously dumb political thriller isn't given room to do much.Just what we need, a chubby, surly, incomprehensible action hero.The non-stop gratuitous violence/explosions/crashes are so implausible that this tedious thriller resembles an arcade video game.Somewhere Vin Diesel is laughing all the way to the bank.chintzy effects work and quasi-military quasi-thrills actually bring to mind a cheesy late-eighties action picture, albeit with less appalling politicsYou always have the option of giving yourself a lobotomy before seeing this. If you do that, you just might like it (or even understand it).Seems more like a combined auto show/Fourth of July celebration for firebugs than a movie.Intellectually as dumb as a door post, but Ice Cube provides enough fun.Now, rather than looking tough, former NWA badass Ice Cube simply seems constipated, and rather than being intimidating he is strangely ingratiating.'Rather then saying the film strikes out I think I'll use a little bowling jargon to sum it up: \"XXX\" is a turkey!'It has just enough sociology, and is wholly dismissive of physics and logic. Still, the last half-hour's unbridled action raises it to the original's enjoyable-trash level.So primitive, it must have been written in lizard blood on animal skin.Embarrassingly amateurish.Any movie that has the President quoting Tupac had an idea somewhere along the way.A childish movie of the shoot 'em up/blow 'em up/here come the flame throwers and the cool-looking weapons genre.[T]his is that oddest of creatures, the blue state action movie.one of the most uninspired and misconceived big-budget action flicks I've ever had to sit through.No one expects brilliant writing in a movie like this, but there are limits -- or there should be.A colossal bore.It's not awful or terrible; it's just generic.As for female characters, in the xXx franchise, there are only two types of women: the ones with big breasts, and the ones with even bigger breasts.Is it too late to toss Ice Cube's name into the hat in the new James Bond sweepstakes? I'd be down with that.It may sound strange to say that this is another boring action film, but it's true....panders to African-American audiences, giving them white caricatures no better than the mammies and bucks of Hollywood's segregated days.The plot is \"ice\" thin and Ice Cube can't hold a candle to Van Diesel in my opinion. If you like a lot of car explosions and action packed scenes you will like this movie.Explosions abound, along with expository dialogue and a ham-tastic triad of performances from Sam Jackson, Willem Dafoe, and Peter Strauss....remains nothing more than a nonsensical and noisy diversion that wallows in its glossed-over big-budgeted B-movie banality.XXX: State Of The Union is an action movie for liberals, and as far as empowerment fantasies go, it's a hoot.Viewed on its own trashy terms, it succeeds brilliantly.At\u0439 mesmo Vin Diesel, astro do pavoroso Opera\u0437\u0433o Bab\u0431, percebeu que este projeto era ruim. Preciso dizer mais?The result is so infantile it might as well be based on the doodles of 8-year-old schoolboys.Not only is Cube AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted, he also our fattest (note: not \"phatest\") action hero. They should have named his character XXXL....an unimaginative, derivative, and ultimately dull riff on the Bond series.Ice Cube makes an appealing lead and no-one ever mentions that he might be a little on the tubby side to really cut it as an action hero.XXX: State of the Union falls flat because Lee Tamahori directs the action scenes with the grace of a bull in a china shop.Aims low and hits the bull's-eye with enough firepower to sink the Bismarck.Delivers the no-thinking-required, over-the-top goods, with some surprising digs at the original film providing the icing on this tasty bit of cinematic junk food.There's not a single scene in this film that doesn't provide at least one unintentional guffaw.A big, dumb action film that exceeds low expectations.full review in GreekWell, they sure blowed 'em up good in XXX: State of the Union. And they pimped many rides. XXX is a car nut's fantasy.Youngsters and action junkies won't mind the film's ridiculous gadgets, secret tunnels and hairsbreadth escapes, but everyone else will have to check credibility at the door.XXXcruciating!In light of the cinematic abomination that is \"XXX: State Of The Union,\" Vin Diesel made the right choice by refusing to do another \"xXx\" movie unless Rob Cohen continued to direct the franchise.You are supposed to walk away entertained, and I did.The only similarity that Cube and Diesel share is that they both appear to have ditched their birth names and pulled their new ones out of a hat.Did I enjoy this movie? Only in a dumb mindless way. It has whatever made the original XXX entertaining, but a little less of it. Does it make the slightest sense? Of course not.Plays less like a sequel to XXX than a parody of it and the whole action genre.Succumbs to a depth of directorial incompetence not seen since the likes of MegaforceI have a perfect way to recreate the XXX experience at home for cheap: simply run headfirst at top speed into a brick wall. Popcorn optional.Cacophonous, ridiculous, and overblown, but it got on my good side.In the words of comic Lewis Black, \"Don't think about it for more than two seconds, or you'll have an aneurysm and your head will explode!\"Opens explosively and never lets up, with Lee Tamahori (Die Another Day) in full command of the action and Simon Kinberg an equally astute writer with a flair for linking socko action set pieces with terse characterization.Ice Cube brings his trademark charisma and street sensibility to a film that wouldn't be nearly as entertaining without it, though he gets considerable help from better-than-the-material-deserves performances by Jackson and Dafoe.There's no wit or imagination, just the thump thump thump of exposition and explosions.Kinberg and Tamahori should be sued for movie malpractice.To say that Tamahori (Die Another Day) panders is to understate his capacity for bread-and-circus-style filmmaking.A humorless foray of noise and fast-cuts signifying nothing much.With Ice Cube at the wheel, it delivers all the adrenaline a junkie could ever want. Just don't pay too much attention to anything else going on in the movie.Functions less as a movie than an overactive adrenal gland.Any excitement over the many eXXXplosions is overpowered by the fact that just about everything here is totally implausible.The most gratifying thing about xXx: State of the Union is that nobody wastes much time on character, motivation, plausibility, dialogue or sex -- all that slow stuff that drags down ordinary movies.This is just a warm-up as the summer movie season gets an early start. Big, loud and stupid, XXX: State of the Union isn't so much a sequel as a preview of coming attractions.There is hardly a word that escapes from anyone's mouth that isn't plain moronic. There are loads of big boobs though, both figuratively and literally...good times.This dim-witted action-thriller might go down better if its presidential-assassination storyline weren't in such bad taste and if its attitude weren't so misogynistic -- and if its attempts at humor were more than lame one-liners.This is garbage, fun garbage at times, but action-bang trash nonetheless.I flat-out defy the filmmakers... to logically explain the course of action in the movie.This is better than its predecessor, but it still lacks something. It's too clean, sanitized and artificial looking, a film like this needs to get down, dirty and grimy.So generic and derivative...that it's hard to turn your brain off and even enjoy the action.xXx: State of the Union is better than the first entry, which is sort of like saying a mallet to the scalp is better than a hammer.Darius Stone has no unique abilities: He's just mean, tough and dogged.There are really only two kinds of big-budget action movies: stupid, and good and stupid. Surprisingly, XXX: State of the Union is good and stupid.The plot holes in this new XXX are XXXL - big enough to drive a tank through.So full of self-aware speechifying, howlingly bad verbal pissing contests, and audacious bulls**t plotting that it almost flies as a parody of itself. Almost. [Blu-Ray]The sequel, rather than being big and dumb, is just dumb.One of the best sequels ever made without the star of the original... The only reason to criticize is if you just don't like big, unrealistic action.OK you don't expect a sequel to 2002's brainless XXX to be an action masterwork, but this is so preposterous that it feels like an overblown spoof of the original.XXX is a subversive film, zipping through an action film in minutes to sideswipe audiences with messages about politics and cinema that may make it the surprise of 2005.Despite its title, XXX: State of the Union is neither pornographic nor political.A dumbed-down, pumped-up takeoff on 'Seven Days in May'...basically brainless pulp--and even at that, not very well-executed pulp.A salt-lick for under-hung jackasses.Burdened by Ice Cube and Sunny Mabrey masquerading as actors, awful, loud rap music and idiotic stunts, this clearly qualifies for the stupid genre....a movie mixed into a video game mixed into a soundtrack mixed into an urban test market report...The movie appears to have employed a Super Nintendo as its screenwriter, and it boasts all the elegance and character development of a Transformers episode.XXXcrement. If it weren't for Ice Cube's charismatic bad attitude, State of the Union would be downright unwatchable.XXX: State of the Union is occasionally fun to watch, if only to see just how much suspension of disbelief your brain can take.XXX: State of the Union is a rip-roaringly funny action flick. That may not be what the producers, director, writer and stars intended, but that's what's up there on the screen.Summits that elusive Pinnacle of Stupidity -- the one where a bad film crosses some indefinable event horizon of moronics and becomes weirdly awesome. You may find yourself laughing harder at State of the Union than at any comedy you see this year.There are bound to be pictures bigger, dumber and more punishing than this one released during the summer, but at least the warm weather also will bring a wider range of alternatives.There's no believing that Big Daddy Darius Stone -- a rather lumpy Ice Cube, who looks like he'd get winded walking up a flight of stairs -- could save the country.Perfectly mindless fun, where the emphasis is on the mindless.The part of me that wasn't rolling my eyes really wanted to know which media bad boy would be next in line.This sequel careens wildly between the uninspired and the absurd, building up to an earsplitting, freakishly over-the-top finale that seems born either of desperation or a bender that would make Hunter S. Thompson proud.Mostly an excuse for cramming as much gratuitous violence as possible into a PG-13-rated flick running only 92 minutes.The chases, shootouts and explosions in this deafening, lamebrained wreck of a movie make the Road Runner cartoons look like National Geographic specials.James Bond's producers aren't going to like Die Another Day director Lee Tamahori delivering a sleeker, more contemporary thriller than he made for them.Plain, old, rancid trash, as careless as it is despicably wasteful. If Xander Cage had to die, the XXX series should have keeled over with him.The producing team behind this sequel to XXX has apparently decided that the only place to go is over the top way over the top.The film's story remains as defiantly impervious to logic as its hero is to bullets.This could be the ultimate video-game movie, in that it sees the world entirely in terms of gigantic explosions that take place regularly every few minutes and which no one in the narrative seems to consider in any way out of the ordinary.At least this movie seems more aware of its trashiness than National Treasure was. It's therefore freer to have some off-the-cuff fun the way Steven Seagal's more tolerable vehicles once did.This xXx seems to know exactly how stupid it is, and this kind of self-knowledge helps nudge it toward the guilty pleasure bracket, even if it never quite makes that leap.As a rating, XXX is used to warn people away from objectionable material. For this movie, it's more like ZZZ.Ice Cube keeps the action-movie franchise alive with a pleasing one-two punch of humor and burly physicality.Most of the movie is standard action fare, but the political commentary is interesting when it's allowed to surface.",

Both directors know when to reveal their ghosts and when simply to suggest them so quietly as to pleasurably levitate neck hairs.This is a great thriller. the supernatural aspect complements the regular one, with fine acting by the kids.If you can imagine Victor Erice's classic Spirit of the Beehive as made by the young Bunuel for Roger Corman, you might just get the flavour of Del Toro's Spanish civil war ghost story and psychodrama.Haunting and unsettling.The Devil's Backbone stands out because of its rich desert-dust palette of golden brown, but otherwise takes no discernable visual stance.A haunting film in every sense...a picture that engages the eye, the heart and the mind with equal success.Beautifully filmed, written and acted.It's a striking film and further good news for the Spanish cinema, too few of whose films open here.Blending terror with tenderness, Guillermo Del Toro has crafted something both traditional and original: a sun-kissed gothic horror.It's a schoolboy ghost story, the kind best told after lights-out.Pure, uncut del Toro. The filmmaker accomplishes riveting scenes of suspense and scares he honestly come by, sticking the landing of every effect he attempts. [Blu-ray]...a hopelessly erratic piece of work.Calling The Devil's Backbone a ghost story is an unfair simplification of an exquisitely crafted film... If you must label this film as horror, then it's a horror film with a soul.A weirdly poetic film.Though it fails in its final reels to capitalize on its early promise, pic is still stylish, accomplished and tremendously enjoyable fare.Besides being genuinely creepy, it is also surprisingly moving. It is, quite probably ... the saddest horror movie ever made.In the end, Backbone is about showing off a horror film director's tools of trade.The Devil's Backbone has been compared to The Others, and has the same ambition and intelligence, but is more compelling and even convincing.Like The Others, it presents a taut, scary tale of hauntings and madness, while going its predecessor one further with a sobering meditation on the horrors of war.It stands alongside this year's The Others as a coolly accomplished ghost story that doesn't have to resort to screaming teens.This haunting, melancholy tale is anchored by Luppi's sad, quiet performanceDel Toro's directorial sure-handedness makes you settle back for an elegantly creepy ride that has some shockingly unsafe stretches.It's fun to watch Del Toro confront death and fear with such energy and humor.After a leisurely first half, The Devil's Backbone becomes utterly spellbinding, its tension mounting in steady increments.A carefully wrought, atmospheric tale that takes its ghosts seriously and treats its audience with respect.Even if it waves its psychological and political implications like a flag, it at least takes a stand against mindlessness.The slow pace and problematic exposition keep it from succeeding on any level.Del Toro piles on the baroque oogie-boogieness to give us an intense feeling of approaching evil.We feel these people's anguish on a viscerally personal level.Del Toro risks ponderousness of pace and symbolism--of an oppressive artiness--to be true to his bleak vision, which is so compelling, unpredictable and unique that The Devil's Backbone really works.Sublimely atmospheric but erratically chilling,...it's too hung up on being more than just a ghost story.A seductively corrosive horror story that also potently suggests the ways war can shatter childhood.Working again with cinematographer Guillermo Navarro, who used sepia filters for an old photograph feel, Mr. del Toro creates an eerie, unnerving mood and maintains it to the end.What gives the story resonance is the tenderness and sacrifice and even innocence del Toro reveals amid the savagery.For those who can stomach this kind of thing, [del Toro has] delivered a haunting work of art that will stay with you for some time.A ghost story that fails the scare test miserably.Whatever the film's final stretches lack in scares it compensates for in humanity.Relies on atmosphere and specific situations to generate tension, and it's smart enough to let that tension build slowly.A ghost story that's not only evocative and original, it's a pleasure to watch.Creepy, meaty, crafty and fun.Let's just say [Del Toro] knows how to create tension.Its unique setting, multi-layered plot and strong artistic voice clearly make it worthy seeing, particularly if you enjoy well-made and well-told spooky films.Sure to give you a serious case of the creeps....sends chills up the spine...When you leave the theater you may find that the sad yet timorously hopeful story has gotten under your skin.This is one weird film by a film maker to watch...closelyJust as he did in Mimic and Cronos, Mexican director Guillermo Del Toro crafts a horror film with deep thought and insight.It builds, not so much logically as viscerally, until you feel you can't escape.The director's strong visual imagination and the fine performances keep us riveted.del Toro provides enough atmosphere and character to elevate it above mediocritydel Toro has a well-known affection for oozing, awful, and also gorgeous images.One of those rare films that can frighten you without feeling the need to be flashy about it.Creepy and compelling and beautifully shot.[Del Toro] understands how war can bring out the strangeness in people's perceptions; fear, as the patriarch played by Federico Luppi says, makes you see things.The chills and suspense and graphic violence are leavened with the horror that comes from knowing the victims -- and knowing they are undeserving of their fate.It has a couple of classic horror moments that will have audiences jumping for the ceiling, but even more ambitious and rewarding is its examination of the horrors of reality.A ghost story with political allegories, it's a compelling tale about the effect of war on children.With the way Hollywood embraced Antonio Banderas, there's no telling what Eduardo Noriega could do if he learns English.The acting is clunky, and the story is straight-to-midnight-movie stunted and not very believable.A supremely elegant film.You'll see how a talented filmmaker sustains suspense with a small budget, few special effects and relatively little gore.The Devil's Backbone is a ghost story that would probably be scary even if the phantoms who inhabit it weren't around.The work of a great stylist with a uniquely disturbing attraction to, and vision of, the frontier between life and death.It seems to want to badly too scare us to make it wholly effective as a political allegory.Satisfies every requirement of its graveyard genre while remaining anchored in real danger, pain, frailty and human dignity.Backbone is a creeper, but with so much more on its mind than recent examples of the genre it almost hurts to make the comparison.An extraordinarily powerful film, filled with chilling moments and evocative characters.A well-crafted, white-knuckle cinematic journey.Captures the fear, confusion and bravery of these boys in a way that is both beautifully ethereal and violently tangible.[Del Toro] finds real substance in shadows and whispers, in the terrors that reside at the back of the mind.The most polished work that Del Toro has created in some time.A ghost story this hypnotically effective is cause for celebration, particularly if you're a horror fan patiently digging through the scrap heaps looking for something worthy of your time.Del Toro has produced a remarkable story that has the feel of authenticity.Weaves a web of ideas and connections.It's not a film that the 1-2-3 moviegoers will likely enjoy because it is quite leisurely paced and methodical, but if ghosts, inventive legends, wicked atmosphere and subtitles do it for you...this export is sure to get a rise out of a few of the littleThere are a couple of excellent plot twists in The Devil's Backbone, but what makes the film so haunting is del Toro's confident direction.Guillermo Del Toro's The Devil's Backbone is a really cool ghost story with an extraordinary human and political dimension.Although spooky, The Devil's Backbone becomes weighed down by perhaps one too many subplots.What Del Toro provides with The Devil's Backbone is the recognition that evil exists within the most routine of circumstances. That knowledge is as old as humanity's belief in the fantastic, and just as powerful.You may find that images from this movie clamber back into your memory weeks after you see it, and give your spine a chill.Del Toro's elegant pacing and gothic touches imbue the proceedings with a cool mystery.Though the whodunnit takes a fairly predictable course, the Spanish Civil War background adds powerful narrative and symbolic weight, while the striking imagery is simply poetic.It's a horror flick, and a creepily good one, that also functions as an allegory of the war that still haunts Spain seven decades later.This moody ghost story follows generally familiar lines despite its unusual historical setting, but it's imaginatively filmed and builds a sense of brooding emotional power.The Devil's Backbone augments its abundant creepiness with an equally powerful poignancy.an elegant, emotionally fraught ghost storyMakes the mistake of revealing too much too soon . . . however, the film excels in most other areas.A visually appealing daylight ghost story...A freakshow royale.A treasure of artistic elements and genres synthesized together in a flawless cohesion of cinematic and visual poetry.If only for its technical aspects, this would rate as a pleasurably superior supernatural psychological thriller, with polished but subtle special effects, painterly, atmospheric cinematography and vivid performances.So much better than Del Toro's studio efforts, with a masterful command of sound and and colour that is breathtaking.An entertaining and atmospheric revenge tale.A finely acted, atmospheric period piece with a strong streak of mystery and the supernatural. Both chilling and rewarding.Atmospheric in detail, the film's visuals are its strongest point.[An] elegant, spooky story.A politically resonant ghost story by one of the masters of the genre.Throughout, del Toro has composed vivid and riveting images that he has combined with a engrossing story.No more and no less than a story of terror well-told.An expert, sunlit chiller audaciously predicated on an unquiet historical memory.Mr. del Toro provokes your screams and shudders, but he also earns your tears.A beautifully crafted melodrama with rich settings, wonderful actors and skin-prickling horror.Creepy, complex and expertly crafted.A genuinely scary, exquisitely shot -- and very well-acted -- ghost story/political allegory.Genuine creepiness, drafted by one of the prime purveyors of intelligent horror.Rich with psychological and political implications that never obscure its fundamental creepiness.",

        "document": "How young people confronted the Nazis. An inspiration for people struggling against war, arbitrary government and ultranationalism today.We haven't seen a comparable clash between a principled heroine and a determined, malevolent villain since Agent Starling matched wits with Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs....a worthy subject, but it doesn't translate into much more than good TV drama.The Scholls were obviously courageous people. It's a shame this film isn't more of a tribute to their bravery.O estilo quase documental assumido pelo cineasta intensifica o drama da situa\u0437\u0433o e nos leva a apreciar ainda mais a coragem e a for\u0437a dos ideais de uma jovem admir\u0431vel (e Jentsch oferece uma atua\u0437\u0433o apaixonante).As Sophie, Julia Jentsch is so good, so coolly passionate and unaffectedly moving in her pursuit of justice, the performance transcends the workmanlike trappings of the film itself.Rothemund gives us his sophisticated filmmaking only in the finale, which is devastating in its briskness and fury.... the orderly and clean drama is more like theater than history come to life.Sophie Scholl: The Final Days doesn't use any cinematic flourishes and embellishments; it doesn't need to.Rarely has bravery been presented with such reserved dignity.The subject matter apart, the film is a meticulously crafted drama, observing and recording the events, setting mood and creating a sense of time and place that further deepen our involvement.While Scholl's virtuous life makes her eminently worthy of her own biopic, it doesn't necessarily make her the most interesting subject for a movie.full review in GreekThe realization that we are, in many instances, listening in on actual proceedings gives the film an immediacy that no dramatist could hope to match.Compelling in its depiction of quiet heroism, this testament to the power of passive resistance is made all the more authentic and poignant by the superbly controlled performance of Julia Jentsch.Jentsch keep[s] up a subtle, restrained performance while the movie Nazis around her are screaming themselves red in the face. She succeeds beyond all expectation.The film has an immeasurable fascination that makes us look on as voyeurs and wonder how we might have reacted during such desperate times.Although Sophie Scholl is noteworthy for its performances, it will undoubtedly fail to capture the popular imagination here.A very tense study of the last days of Nazism, and a worthy homage to a true heroine...A claustrophobic bio-pic which telescopes tightly on the torture of the fearless activist till her demise after less than a week in the hands of Hitler's sadistic interrogators.The movie reminded me of one of those books for young readers that skims the surface, taking care to avoid any material that might contradict or confuse.With the exception of a melodramatic musical score, director Marc Rothemund never missteps, filming the remarkable true story with restraint and skill.The director, Marc Rothemund, has kept the unbridled horror of the Nazi period carefully tamped down ... The prospect of inescapable doom that hangs over the heads of the three main characters is horrific enough.The sentence against her is carried out with startling promptness; because of the movie's title, we are not surprised, but we are jolted.[Jentsch] creates a deeply human portrait of a courageous young woman at a moment when that kind of courage seemed in terribly short supply.Rothemund and screenwriter Fred Breinersdorfer have locked themselves into an episodic structure that offers virtually no nuance.Highly personal and wrenching story.Elegant in its moral and artistic simplicityOffers the rousingly cathartic spectacle of a young woman who stood up and did what the country has been accused for 70 years of failing to do: to its face, she told Hitler's Third Reich to shove it.A powerful, valid and worthy exercise, to be sure. But not emotional, and emotions are the fuel of cinema.Julia Jentsch conveys strength and vulnerability in equal measure; it's easy to understand how she could rally or provoke people when she stands up for what's right.Sophie Scholl: The Final Days wants to avoid the sentiment that is inherent in the details of her tragic demise, but in doing so, it's leeched the emotional power out of her life and death.Sophie has rightfully collected several awards and should continue to do so, not only because it's a well-crafted and beautifully acted film, but because it relays an urgent message.The film holds us rapt not through narrative suspense but through the eerie and demanding spectacle of profound moral courage, of a powerless good person in collision with absolute evil.Hinges on a superb centerpiece performance by Julia Jentsch.Rothemund's film, like last year's Downfall, benefits from its scrupulous treatment of history and generally restrained performances.This seeming psychological incongruity made Sophie more human and more heroic to me, as well as more worthy of the deep respect that George Bernard Shaw and Danish filmmaker Carl Dreyer expressed for Saint Joan.Everyone must see this film, because while we're not yet at the point at which college kids who distribute flyers criticizing a warmongering government are being executed for their political agitating, we cannot ever, ever get to that point.Plays like one of the better \"Law and Order\" episodes.German actress Julia Jentsch is phenomenal in the lead role, bringing a vulnerability to a character perhaps a bit too perfect on the page.One of a very few films that accomplishes one of the rarest and most valuable of cinematic achievements: It makes heroic goodness not just admirable, but attractive and interesting....Jentsch draws you into it until you find yourself so involved, you may be astonished.Sophie Scholl has a certain quiet dignity that wins its audience popularity honestly.There is little sense of what sets this seemingly ordinary girl apart and gives her her steely resolve.Sophie Scholl: The Final Days may sound like a history lesson, but don't be fooled. It's a horror film.While the film doesn't dig deep, or hit particularly hard, it neatly achieves its modest goals: presenting a real-life heroine in real-life terms. A film this fictionalized rarely feels this much like fact.Jentsch is a mesmerizing presence in the role of this incredibly strong young woman, as is Mohr playing a man whose humanity and political beliefs are at odds.Sophe Scholl: The Final Days is an oddly economical, exceptionally detailed and, finally, horrifying movie that surprises one with its cumulative power.Sophie Scholl - The Final Days is a worthy work that presents valuable new information about the case.As befits a film about a woman who took much of her strength from religious conviction, Jentsch's performance seems to be lit from within.Sophie Scholl is a powerful story.Straightforwardly scripted, it's not difficult to imagine this earnest and conventional retelling as if it were an original Playhouse 90 production.The film is a shattering experience fueled by [Julia] Jentsch's electrifying performance.Sophie Scholl: The Final Days does a good job of catching the heady optimism of youth, and the fearless dedication to a lost cause that only the true believer can muster.Sophie Scholl perpetuates the celluloid mythologizing of the second World War, filtering the banality out of real events and people, replacing them with heroic posturing.Sophie Scholl: The Last Days is a traditional and competently made film; Julia Jentsch's steely performance is brilliant.A career-defining performance by Julia Jentsch drives this riveting German thrillerThis gripping true story conveys what it must have been like to be a young, smart, idealistic dissenter in Nazi Germany, where no dissent was tolerated.Finely controlled...a docu-drama of seriousness and integrity.A compelling and deftly acted portrait of a female freedom fighter against the Nazi war machine in 1943 Germany.The film has a serious, urgent tone, but not a preachy or strident one.The narrative is tight and compelling, claustrophobic in scope, with acting performances that chill in their understated anxiety and courage.Through it all, Jentsch is a beacon of bravery and resolve in the darkness of a totalitarian machine. If any actor in an English-language film has given a better performance in the past year, I'd like to see it.I found this Oscar-nominated film overlong and ultimately disappointing.The film holds few surprises, though it builds a remarkable level of suspense during the fait-accompli interrogation scenes, and is a well-intended commemoration of a courageous young woman.There's a resonance to Sophie Scholl that crosses borders and approaches the timeless.There's no moment of release, no instant of sudden redemption in this powerful, moving, and altogether devastating film.Though Scholl's inquisition and trial are harrowing, there's too little sense of what sort of person Scholl was. We can only grasp at air and guess what it was inside her that drove her to forsake her life in favor of a higher purpose....to shorten the discussions between Mohr and Scholl would have been to miss the point. She makes her lasting impression on Mohr, and us, not by violence, or cacophony, but by the persistence, patience and persuasiveness of her intellectual discourse...[Sophie and Hans] embody the adolescent faith that any political action is better than none, and the movie couldn't treat them more glowingly if their actions had been effective.Director and writer take pains to adapt Nazi interrogation records into an accurate and well crafted tale of civil courage and a selfless portrayal by Julia Jentsch.Marc Rothemund's treatment is oppressively dull and unimaginative.The true story of the anti-Nazi heroine Scholl, who was captured, interrogated and exceuted in 1943, is brough to the screen for the third time with tact, intelligence, and accuracy but no dramatic excitement.Rothemund's drama is gripping, the acting carefully and convincingly nuanced, and the plot masterfully paced.Captures the faint but nonetheless discernable strain of feminist camaraderie and religiosity that served as complementary components of Scholl's insurgent anti-Nazi \"idea\" of liberty and equality for all.A story of commitment that makes up for lack of glitz with currency of message.As ideas are shot back and forth, 'Sophie Scholl' becomes an admirable, but not entirely successful, morality play.Julia Jentsch gives a brilliantly nuanced performance as Sophie, a fun-loving girl who likes marmalade and Schubert but also happens to be a rare beacon of conscience in totalitarianism's dark night.powerful and movingIt is powerful, straightforward, utterly without pretense and very, very moving.Contains a riveting dialogue between an anti-war German woman and a not-so-rigid Gestapo agent.The film's claustrophobic intensity and emotional punch certainly deserve to be cheered.The film itself may be very classical in its approach [but] the sheer power of Jentsch's performance and Sophie's own words make this film an absolute must-see.Sophie Scholl's is a story well worth telling, and this movie is one well worth checking out.A true-life story told in the Perry Mason style, this German gem uncovers a slice of European history that many of us were unfamiliar with.The courage to act as she and her colleagues did in the worst possible scenario should inspire anyone, of whatever political stripe, to speak out before it gets to the point where her story could possibly be a true one.Devout but no saint, Sophie was one of those people whose moral gravity (helped by a wonderful family) bears witness for humanity when that is most needed.A disturbing film about courage, idealism, youth and the grim mechanics of mankind gone mad.Those with the courage to stick with director Marc Rothemund's fact-based drama will discover a wrenching, infuriating and ultimately uplifting experience.The film's notions about the importance of free speech and the proliferation of ideas are obviously important -- it's a message that needs to be spread in our own uncertain times.Frank and frightening.Electrifying ... As serenely played by Jentsch, Sophie is a heroine made radiant by the blinding truth of her moral convictions.Interesting story, but the movie does nothing to stand out from the crowd",

        "document": "For fans of wildlife programmes, Earth will be nothing new - it is, after all, a re-cut version of the BBC series Planet Earth -- but this is a wildlife film at the very top of its game.EARTH opens with a dazzling scene of the planet from space and then flits around the globe to give us equally astonishing shots of animals in survival mode and at play.For most of the way this is an eye-popping, not blood-curdling, experience....if not exactly innovative, at least breathtaking on a how-in-the-world-did-they-get-that-shot level.Setting new standards in precision wildlife photography, \"Earth\" remains little more than eye candy. A Playboy magazine of the planet earth.What this is, in fact, is the live-action version of the opening of The Lion King, celebrating the 'circle of life.'Earth caters to a younger audience, keeping its biological and environmental lessons at a basic level of understanding.I didn't learn anything but it's fun, which I didn't expect. Animals do stuff. I don't see how it's an overall ecosystem but whatever.The production values of this film are very good, but it wanders away from its three main storylines often enough that it may not hold the attention of children.It's not only a good watch but is informative.Disney puts truth in the drawer claiming that \"changing weather patterns\" cause drying rainforests, when it's the destruction of the rainforest that is causing the changing weather patterns.It just feels like cheating. This is the exact footage used in the \"Planet Earth\" series. I even miss the full Disney treatment. No cute names given to the animals? How will you sell more stuffed animals?The voice of Darth Vader, James Earl Jones, narrates this lively and majestic nature documentary that traces a year in the life of our planet by way of some its most enchanting species.It might seem awfully mean to critique a nature documentary released by Walt Disney on Earth Day -- but that's exactly what I'm about to do.As a movie made with kids -- and mass consumption -- in mind, Earth labors under some frustrating limitations. But as a palatable, engaging reel of incredible nature photography, it has few equals.Parental Content ReviewThis 'Earth' is so beautiful.If nature's what you crave, you'll have more fun sitting on your porch and watching mosquitoes impact with a bug zapper.A top-drawer documentary that provides the perfect occasion for families to celebrate together the wonders, diversity, and miracles of nature and animals.It never quite lives up to the level of filmmaking set by the Disney nature films of yore.Enriching, informative and noteworthy, Earth explores the wonderment of our neighboring species and the behavioral observations that ensue in glorified curiosity.A well-made doc that will prompt the viewer to think, 'Is a vulnerable animal better off safe in a zoo or with risks in the jungle?'Spectacularly photographed, gracefully edited, and effectively matter-of-fact in demonstrating the effects of of climate change.Fundamentally a condensed trailer for the BBC's portrait of the globe's myriad habitats, the film offers a skimpy but reverential portrait of the intertwined relationship between the environment and its inhabitants.It is as beautiful a film as I've seen in some time.Stars Mother Nature and the photography deserve standing applause.This is a film that doesn't know when to shut up and gaze in wonder.Spectacular footage and a low-key ecological message make this first release from the Disneynature label a valuable family offering.Full of great, gorgeous footage. Beautiful enough to forgive Disney for Hannah Montana: The Movie.It really is impressive to see these images so up close on a big screen.Our responsibility to protect this ecosystem underscores every image; watching is submission to our call of duty. Yet, Earth feels compromised where Planet Earth was notBreathtaking. Take a break from the gridlock, concrete and steel jungle that defines most of our lives. These are some fantastic, won't believe your eyes, animal shots.A welcome throwback to the days when Walt himself would personally supervise such Earth-friendly fare as The Living Desert and The Vanishing Prairie.Every bit as majestic and eye-opening as the title infers.Earth is 85 minutes of graceful animals, scary animals, funny animals, and excruciatingly cute baby animals. A better family-friendly nature film can't be found.Dazzling wildlife docu has a few intense moments.Nature can be cruel, children, but damned if it isn't seriously photogenic.It's such a joy to see this footage on the big screen -- even better than hi-definition TV -- that you may want to suffer the slings and arrow of an outrageous soundtrack just for the opportunity to see what's on the screen.There's no question that, given the option, Planet Earth is the way to go. This movie will do in a pinch, however, and it is impressive -- provided you find a way to block out the voiceovers.When a subject is as big as all outdoors, the big screen has some advantages.Spectacular! Remarkable in every way, even better than the 2005 Oscar winner, 'March Of The Penguins', this is a breathtaking motion picture achievement.This is, after all, the circle of life, and while it's kindly to watch adorable creatures partake in adorable behavior (polar bears sliding around in snow!), the reality of existence is far more dangerous.Has lots of stunning visuals and wonders of nature to behold, but ultimately lacks insight and never really achieves the exhilarating heights and palpable poignancy of March of the Penguins.The Disney connection marks 'Earth' as a worthy heir to the Oscar-winning 'True-Life Adventures' the company produced from 1948 to 1960...If your family enjoys this kind of entertainment, do yourself a favor and rent the BBC's \"Planet Earth\" from which most of the spectacular footage was lifted.The beauty of the landscape, the beauty of the animals, it's all irresistible.This Earth is beautiful and worthwhile.The many filmmakers spent five years on this impressive project. They've given us glorious images of an Earth that most of us have never seen. Let's hope that the means to understand it will be included on the DVD.A wide-screen wildlife documentary in which the cycles of birth and death, migrations and seasons, are captured in stunning -- absolutely stunning -- ways.With its little-bit-of-everything approach, Earth sometimes feels more like really glorious wallpaper than a satisfying story. But there's no arguing with those images. They're fantastic.It's very instructive and hey, where else can you see footage like this? On Animal Planet, the Discovery Channel, the National Geographic Channel, etc., just about every night.Earth succeeds well enough as spectacle.It's not that this lovely-to-look-at nature documentary is bad: it's just that it's completely redundant as a film.Jones' narration is both warm and authoritative. If Mufasa can't make kids care about the Earth, it might be a lost cause.No other movie (documentary or feature film) has featured as many \"wow!\" moments as this one does in quite some time.This Earth doesn't really have anything new to say, but it does present some newly entertaining ways of saying it.A splendid wildlife documentary.entertains as much as it educatesFeels like a thin introduction rather than a rich tapestry.Earth is at its best when it goes beyond presenting awe-inspiring beauty to elicit a sense of wonder and empathy for our fellow creatures and of global responsibility toward our fragile planet.A gorgeously photographed storybook.As a virtual tour of what Earth Day is about, kids ought to be entranced. If it helps them get greener, even better.Earth isn't especially informative or original. But it is packed with beauty and wonder.Featuring edited moments from the popular Planet Earth as seen on Discovery Channel, apparently Disney's idea of going green is to recycle film footage for theaters.Earth is a film of epic proportions which carries a lot of intensity and stunning visuals but drags a little in the beginning before picking up some steam.This spectacularly shot doc gives our big, blue planet her due, with rare peeks at exotic creatures and thrilling action scenes.What it does well is so remarkable that by the time the credits roll you likely won't want it to end.With such a photogenic and charismatic cast, how could Earth miss?Think of Earth as being akin to a greatest-hits collection of a beloved rock band. The context is gone, but the reason for the renown remains.This first release from Disney's self-explanatory new arm, Disneynature, is at the very least peripherally concerned with the planet and its dwindling prospects, but the real renewable resource here is the groundbreaking Planet Earth miniseries.In a sea of Hollywood formula, artifice and escapism, here is an invitation to wonder, awe and gratitude.Directors Alastair Fothergill and Mark Linfield mostly avoid speaking directly of social issues. Instead, they let the visuals and the animals' plights underscore the importance of maintaining a healthy ecosystem.For adults, Earth misses the mark of riveting storytelling. Earth crams in the dramatic adventures of several species (including penguins) -- with the result that it comes up short on telling one really good story.As a spectacle Disney's Earth is right out of this world.[The directors] know how to craft a sequence (lions and elephants uneasily drinking at the same water hole), have an eye for the telling shot (baboons mincing across a flood plain), and mercifully avoid making the fauna look human.Take a bow, Mother Nature.For a round-the-world trip, it feels a bit like a budget bus tour.For a generation too young to remember National Geographic specials and Disney's True-Life Adventures, [this] should be an exciting journey through our natural world.... the images that are captured by the filmmakers are so stunning and breathtaking that you would really be doing yourself a disservice if you didn't see them up on the big screen.Don't let the fact that this film is re-edited from existing footage stop you from seeing it. It is quite simply breathtaking on the large screen.This film is for those so buried in gadgets and The Gap that the Earth, at its roots, has become something foreign.Earth may be the most striking collection of nature photography I've ever seen. It isn't flawless, but it is a one-of-a-kind treat.A gorgeously photographed nature documentary that doesn't have enough happy moments and has far too many tragic ones.It's impossible to not come away with a renewed respect, appreciation and awe for this place we all call home.When Disney gets involved in making things green, we're talking about the color of money.Earth hits all the right notes, and if Disney corners the market on nature documentaries and creates an annual cinematic event of this caliber tied into Earth Day, so be it.Solid docu about global-warming informs rather than preaches.A beautiful mix of humor, heart and spectacle that puts the studio that invented the True-Life Adventure back in touch with its wild side.Reminds us that no matter where you are, this third rock from the sun of ours is a gorgeous thing.Like Arctic Tale, this is a great looking and interesting view of nature. Also like that other 2007 film, Earth falls short of being truly memorable.Those familiar with the Discovery series Planet Earth won't find anything new here, but the James Earl Jones-narrated movie is fine on its own.",

That's something.\" Even so, the narrative is not quite big enough to bear the weight and significance that writer-director John Lee Hancock tries to attach to it.Parental Content ReviewWorks in its own simple way because we believe and connect to these characters.It is easily Bullocks best performance over a career that spans two decades.Speaking of being blindsided, The Blind Side is good enough to make me almost forgive Sandra Bullock for All About SteveLewis' earlier and even better sports book, Moneyball, also is in a turbulent journey toward the big screen, but after this film, he may hope it never gets there....had its heart in the right place, but in order to have a shred of believability, it needed more grit. The Tuohys are cardboard saints with a big bank account and Oher is their big lump of clay.This movie is smarter than it had to be, which gives its emotional core even more of punch.'The Blind Side' may not make the All-American sports movies team, but it plays with plenty of heart.In the movie The Blind Side, truth is sacked and authenticity is fumbled -- all in the name of cheerleading. The Blind Side is not true -- it is a crowd-pleasing white wash.I really wanted to like John Lee Hancock's The Blind Side. In fact, I wanted to love it.... presents the upbeat family-film playbook with no surprises, but if you're in the mood for a feel-good flick, this is an excellent choice.The pile-on of big emotional moments, accompanied by big music, is overwhelming. This is a movie demanding to be loved.Subtlety is horse-collared in John Lee Hancock's disappointingly Lifetime-ish sports film. It lacks the subtlety or nuance of his \"The Rookie\" and is borderline offensive in spots, but Sandra Bullock easily delivers her career's best performance.Veers a bit close... to Capra territory, but its sure, honest touch carries it effortlessly into the end zone.Has quite a lot in common with Precious, although this is a much more mainstream movie with a more white-liberal perspective[T]his utterly unsurprising, unchallenging feel-good flick mostly ignores larger social concerns in telling its implausible tale...If ever Sandra Bullock had Oscar nomination potential, it comes in her canny performance as a Southern Republican with a heart of gold.The black kid is the MacGuffin around which revolves the affected lives of white people.The movie glosses over the deeper issues of the tale, ones dealing with race, poverty, privilege and ethics, opting for the feel-good quick hit that makes the overall experience unsatisfying.What makes The Blind Side a Thanksgiving treat is director Hancock's subtle touch and admirable refusal to yield to sports movie clich\u00e9s, something he did previously with The Rookie and Remember the Titans....it reminds us that initial impressions can be deceiving.The Blind Side is a terrifically touching, thoroughly entertaining film.I should hate this movie with every ounce of my being (and that's alot of ounces). Yet, it has a certain charm that draws you in like the girl next door.Judging by the awful trailers, I did not think in a million years I would see a wonderful true story that perfectly balanced comedy and drama. Bullock was fantastic.Surely post-recession America will turn out in droves for this cinematic version of a hug. But should they?The film is played with a focus on low-key charm and quiet drama, and there's a warm, human sense of humor.Blond, brisk and all business, [Bullock is] easily the best thing about the film, which otherwise slumps into a cloying, condescending morass that doesn't do her fine work any favors.It's hard to overlook that while Michael's benefactors are white, the villains in the movie are black.Bullock may have found her Erin Brockovich in Tuohy, commanding the screen with grit and determination in an Oscar-worthy role if ever there was one.Another uplifting and entertaining feel-good, fact-based sports drama.Missed opportunities and surface gestures aside, Hancock draws affable, energetic performances from all concerned.Its m.o. isn't understanding or identification, just white self-congratulation.Sandra Bullock renders a strong performance as the feisty Southern belle in this inspirational sports saga, but the film is too conventional and doesn't offer a deep look into the psychology of the players or the interracial subtext.Institutional racism as inspirational melodrama, it's regressive entertainment, our very own Triumph of the Will.Don't turn a blind eye to \"The Blind Side\" as it is one of the best films this year!A movie that inspires. Sandra Bullock is refreshingly different and gives a superb performance. Paul Chambers, CNN.Hardly the most daring, profound or clever picture of the year, but certainly one of the most touching.If not for Sandra Bullock...The Blind Side would have drowned in its own mediocrity.Incessantly positive because it's about good deeds and its ripple effects.Sandra Bullock finally reaches her potential in this heart-warming true story,...a terrific movie.Blind Side uses old playbook to jerk tears.We all want Big Mike to be saved from the life so many are stuck with. I'm simply shocked Bullock was up to the task of doing the saving. Yes, it appears I was blindsided.The kind of film that works on you while you're watching it, but is finally like a second helping of dessert that leaves you feeling ever so slightly sick afterwards.Syrupy sports drama uplifts but glosses over deep issues.A movie made up almost entirely of turning points and yet curiously devoid of drama or suspense.Take a real-life story like The Blind Side, which on the surface sounds pretty sappy, and turn it into something honest, heartfelt and surprisingly inspirational.A Hollywoody realization of a great real life triumph. Has its faults, but nicely directed, acted and edited, on the whole.Bullock's the main reason to see the film: She's believably feisty and funny as an ex-college cheerleader turned into a strong-minded, NRA card-carrying Southern belle with whom you should not mess.To paraphrase a quote from an ex-NFL coach, The Blind Side is what we thought it would be, but it's also a whole lot more.There are so many ways this film could have gone badly, but writer/director John Lee Hancock has taken Michael Lewis' book of the same title and made it into a believable, non-sentimental movie.See it for the heartwarming story it is, and for Sandra Bullock's best movie in quite a while.A feel-good sports drama about the intersection of race and athletics, with solid if unremarkable performances that strains just a little too hard for social relevanceRecycles the charitable messages of other religion-based films, from \"Facing the Giants\" to \"Fireproof,\" but presents them in an accessible, mainstream package.Zanatski korektno djelce u kojem poku%u0161aji da se filmu pred kraj \"napumpa\" drama nisu previ%u0161e uvjerljiviIt's guaranteed to make you feel all fuzzy and warm inside and the saintly Bullock makes up for the disastrous (and Razzie award-winning) All About Steve.Watching The Blind Side, I felt my emotions being stage-managed, but once or twice I got something in my eye.Generally enjoyable, but it isn't until the credits roll that you'll realize what a major sentimental impact it has on you.A nice-as-pie story that lacks any real tension or drama and threatens repeatedly to veer into sappy territory, yet somehow, just through foolhardy \"goodness\", manages to be consistently enjoyable (if a little slight) for its two hours.The Blind Side's heart is in the right place--how could it not be, it's got so much to go around--but that's about all that is. There's a good story in there, one that's probably worth experiencing, but load up on insulin before you go.While The Blind Side constantly threatens to deteriorate into sentimental saccharine, it never does. Bullock's accent grates at first, but she bonds well with McGrawUna cinta amena, sencilla de digerir y apta para toda la familia, una f\u00e1bula de la vida real de las que pocas veces suceden y cuando lo hacen, son dignas de llevarlas a la pantalla.Sports movie carefully sidesteps the issue of race and stereotypesIt often feels like a Republican curative for Precious.Although based in reality, John Lee Hancock's tale never seems more than just a more serious version of TV's Different Strokes or Webster.If a Hallmark greeting card could throw up, the puke would come in the form of The Blind Side.The movie's title refers to the area of a football field that the left tackle protects, but it could easily refer to an audience unaware of its prejudices.Its superficiality keeps it from being the moving story it could have been.Sandra Bullock shows her acting talent in this uplifting movie that entertains on all levelsPotentially culturally offensive and overly schmaltzy, The Blind Side instead threads an almost impossible needle, pulling off a surprisingly moving and inspirational story of compassion, self-discovery and hope.Unfortunately, it had to battle against the dumb, romantic juggernaut New Moon. Sandra Bullock and company will give you many more moments of enjoyment than any lame hormonally-challenged vampire-werewolf can offer.For many African-Americans, The Blind Side will be familiar with its elements of 'The Great White Hope' and 'The Magical Negro.' But, this is a true story. You can't hate a story for being true, even if it might channel legendary Hollywood stereotypes.Oher\u00e2(TM)s life is meant to make us feel good, and it mostly does. But how good we feel about his story is proportional to how blind we\u00e2(TM)re willing to be about how it\u00e2(TM)s told.Yes, this feel-good sports/biographical drama is predictable and by-the-numbers. Yet for the most part, this cinematic \"comfort food\" goes down pretty well.However obvious, The Blind Side is touching -- despite its habit of dropping major character notes into the melody without warning....an affable (if entirely unremarkable) piece of work...It's a feel-good movie that could have been a more intellectual, honest exercise, but it's still a feel-good movie that works on its own terms.The problem with a story that's almost too good to be true is that someone in Hollywood will try to make it better.What a drag that, one year into Obama's presidency, American films remain so careful about depicting black actors.The Blind Side is only ambitious enough to be a solid, earnest -- if long -- crowd pleaser.\"This feels way too manipulative to be taken seriously\"Upon seeing [Bullock's] Oscar-worthy performance is \"finally!\" followed quickly by, \"Why the heck did it take so long?\"The filmmakers pay lip service to the story's racial undertones without ever really rocking the leaky boat.It's a cute, touchy-feely crowd pleaser that wants nothing more than to wrap audiences in a warm holiday embrace. In a sense, it achieves that goal, but it is overly sentimental in a Lifetime movie kind-of-way.We never learn why Leigh Anne is so fearless, but Bullock is the force here. McGraw is an amiable anchor to her bull-by-the-horns portrayal.It speaks of faith, hope and charity with the down-to-earth tones and rhythms of a high school percussion band in a Thanksgiving Day parade.Hancock mostly restricts the story's scope to its heartwarming bits and begs off any serious investigation of race. The reason, of course, is that this isn't that kind of movie. But I couldn't help but wish that it were.Here is a movie that honours a downtrodden financial, racial and political minority: rich, white southern Republicans who carry guns and aren't afraid to threaten black people with them.Shows that America, for all its loudhailed Christianity, doesn't really need God at all. It just needs Sandra Bullock and her like.Bullock turns in a terrific, ball-breaking performance. Unfortunately, the rest of the film is painfully patronising.You have to keep reminding yourself that The Blind Side is based on real events. It seems much more like a cannily concocted, sugar-coated fairytale designed to inspire and uplift.A Photoshopped image of reality that is bland, parochial, and stereotypically acted by a cast who have nothing like the subtlety and range of Trey Parker's puppets from Team America: World Police.Enjoyable, mass-market crowd pleaser that allowed Sandra Bullock to win an honorable Best Actress Oscar as the Republican spitfire who takes up the cause of a homeless teenager who just so happens to also be an outstanding left tackle.The Blind Side wears its heart on its shoulder padding for the entire 128 minutes and eventually, the wholesomeness of the characters, pulling together for a common cause, wins us over.Some will find it overly sentimental but it does succeed in pulling at the heartstrings - and Sandy proves she really can act.Sandra Bullock is two for three in 2009.It's all a bit too pat and convenient, and sadly, a little bit racist.A few momentary hiccups aside, the film plays out in sickly-sweet fashion, relentlessly shoving the Touhy's self-righteous values down the audiences' throat and never bothering to consider the wider social ramifications...A sports drama that's more about the melodrama and less about the sport.It's clumsy, obvious film-making but then if you buy into it, well, it's kind of lovably basic in its emotional button pushing.Oher's miserable start in life shouldn't have happened, but it did -- and The Blind Side is a film that shouldn't work, but does.You will be moved, but at the price of any nuance or complexity.It's a celluloid version of Paul McCartney and Stevie's Wonder's Ebony and Ivory, one in which pious, infantilizing didacticism masquerades as humanitarianism.There are several good scenes, even if you can spot the Oscar / trailer clips a mile away, such as when one of Leigh Anne's stuck-up friends remarks \"You're changing that boy's life\" and she replies, \"Nope. He's changing mine.\"Quite how Sandra Bullock deserved an Oscar for her one-note turn as bleached supermum Leigh-Anne is a mystery, since it transforms a potentially worthwhile character study into a grandstanding star vehicle.The movie's obsessed with the Tuohy clan's constant kindness towards Mike, and the social knock-on effects for them. But it barely gives a second thought to the poor sod's own struggle with suddenly finding himself a charity case.Bullock has pulled a blinder herself. It's a doughty performance, and worth singling out.It does the crowd-pleasing act almost perfectly.Bullock is certainly likable, but the fact that her performance (let alone the movie itself) is considered Oscar-worthy is ludicrous.Though not without its racist undertones, [the film] manages to take an inspiring story and use it to compose an entertaining and compelling tale...The film is also up for an Oscar but will surely fall into the \"it's an honour just to be nominated\" category. Still, it's an enjoyable film and arguably Bullock's best.Whether the movie was worthy of Oscar consideration is another matter, but there is little doubt it is uplifting and inspirational.Cannot be denied its to-be-reckoned-with sincerity.The fact that The Blind Side is a terrible movie must be approached gingerly.There are several ouch-worthy moments like this in The Blind Side, but they are spaced just far enough apart not to devalue the real worth of Michael Oher's story.With far less potential than Precious, superior production values and the willingness to tell the story in a straightforward way prove to be the right formula.It pushed my outrage buttons like no movie since those Ghetto-bots in Transformers 2 admitted they didn't know how to read.Hancock tugs at the heart strings and wrings the tear ducts with the same ruthless efficiency as a Superbowl playbook.Un drama sencillo y humano, inspirado en una historia real, cuyo principal atractivo es Sandra Bullock en un ligero cambio de tono. No es el primer drama en el que participa, pero s\u00ed su labor dram\u00e1tica m\u00e1s convincente hasta la fecha.It's so clich\u00e9d and so patronising and there's more than a whiff of racism.Some situations seem very contrived, but ultimately there's no doubting that Bullock has created a memorable character in Leigh Anne.Writer-director John Lee Hancock wisely lets the true story of Michael Oher speak for itself.Especially effective is the gently comic interplay between the solemn Michael (Aaron has little dialogue but speaks volumes through his expressive eyes) and Bullock's pushy Southern mama, who has a firm grip on tough love and usually gets what she wants.Writer-director John Lee Hancock has turned Oher's remarkable life into a Hollywood fable that trades difficult truths for easy clich\u00e9s.Sarah Palin isn't the only gun-toting, ex-cheerleader, conservative Christian sports mom back in the news. This week also gives us Sandra Bullock as Leigh Anne Tuohy...In probably her best performance ever, Sandra Bullock is downright brilliant. As in CRASH, Bullock proves again that she is much better at drama than comedy.Bullock adds two extra dimensions to her usual one-dimensional, cutesy, addle-brained personality and gives the performance of her life.A mostly heartfelt, compelling and inspirational albeit occasionally contrived sports drama.I believe the real Leigh Anne Tuohy did a wonderful, selfless thing and I told her so when I interviewed her. She deserves a better movie to be made about her.... could wind up giving inspirational sports pictures a good name.The movie contains enough humor and heartbreak (though next to no dramatic tension) to make it an engaging if undemanding experience.I sure wish Sandra Bullock would get out of the business of making crappy rom-coms and make more movies like The Blind Side ...Some true stories, however pleasant, just don't make for interesting movies.Without adding too much cheese, director John Lee Hancock channels genuine emotion from the Michael Lewis book (and the reality) that prompted this moving chronicle.If you're looking for an uplifting sports story, this one, familiar as it is, manages a winning score.Insightful, inspiring and football-themed - what could be timelier for Thanksgiving?Feels less like a true story than a synopsis.The tender interaction between Leigh Anne and Michael sustains the Blind tension, not plastic acts of tragedy or insensitive supporting characters. Too bad Leigh Anne wasn't allowed in the editing room to knock some sense into Hancock.There's real ambiguity in the Oher case, but writer-director John Lee Hancock papers over it; it's possible to see the Tuohys as generous, caring people without brushing off their less-altruistic reasons for sponsoring Oher.Director John Lee Hancock defuses class resentment by making sure that everybody in the family is as adorable as possible...The Blind Side fumbles a remarkable, true story of an African-American product of the West Memphis projects who ended up at a Christian school and in the care of a wealthy white family, and then went on to professional football glory.A wonderful feel-good fact-based sports story about the gifts of nurturing love and a redefinition of family values.Some will doubtlessly dismiss The Blind Side as another example of a heroic white person saving a black victim but, although there is an element of truth in that perfunctory description, it misses the point.The so-called \"feel-good\" film functioning as a well-timed balm for the conflicted soul of white America. But rather than a clear-eyed look at the disparity between upper-crust suburbs and a cross-town ghetto, we get gloss of the highest order.What The Blind Side offers is a kind of liberal Hollywood version of conservative values: all rock-solid valor, all the time.It's a wonderful role for Bullock, who delivers her best performance yetThe story is told in the recognisable Hollywood manner, polished and packaged, but that doesn't detract from its impact.. it also tackles some of the darker materials of the storyA gratifying yet grounded drama whose exemplary cast propel the action and tug at the heart-strings. Recommended.It's just blinkered middle-class pandering at its most shameless.All Bullock's films promote an edifying sense of human experience -- she has an instinct for what people like to see -- and that gift makes The Blind Side the perfect, God-sent antidote to Precious.Ultimately, race has nothing to do with the truth of the emotions this film elicits from an audience. It's a solid movie, whether you're color blind or not.In every scene, Oher is instructed, lectured, comforted, or petted like a big puppy; he is merely a cipher.John Lee Hancock's quasi docu-dramatization of Michael Lewis' book ... scores well in the basics of bringing this inspirational story to the screen but fumbles the chance for greatness due to the preponderance of one-dimensional characters.If Sandra Bullock weren't already a star, a star-making turn this would be.'The Blind Side' is an emotionally uplifting tale in which Sandra Bullock excels in her best performance since 'Crash.'OK, Sandra Bullock. I publicly forgive you for the ghastly 'All About Steve.'Even if it weren't true, The Blind Side would be a special film.While terrorism thrillers may be high on Hollywood's to-do list lately, movies about escape from the rumored terrors of ghetto life by unusually large people, may not be far behind.An antiseptic answer to Precious designed for the tweener demographic.Yes, it is one of the more tired genres around, and no, it's not as good as the book. But \"The Blind Side,\" is a nice surprise- a heartfelt drama that tells an amazing story remarkably well.Will never be remembered as one of the best sports films, but it may go down as one of the feel-good movies of the year and possibly as Sandra Bullock's best.Writing is real-life strong, directing perfect, Bullock makes you believe she has lived this life, and McGraw can give up the road. He's got an effortless charm.Despite being factual strains credibility.Hollywood nearly ruins a great true story like The Blind Side by piling on the schmaltz.You're going to be crying by the end.A living tribute to fundamental Christian motivations, although the point is hammered home with an extraordinarily soft touch: Love thy neighbor.Football may the thread that runs throughout, but the movie is much more interested in the tale of how Oher left behind a life of poverty, violence and foster-home despair to become a champ on the gridiron.Serves its purpose by making the audience tear up in some moments and cheer in others. It's a total button-pusher, but it does so in a very good way.It's certainly a heartwarming tale and Bullock delivers a big, ballsy performance as the indomitable Tuohy - but Oscar-worthy? What were they thinking?As a fable about the power of giving, it hits pretty hard.The movie is very familiar -- you've seen it all before -- but it succeeds at achieving its modest goals.The movie is done with crispness, vigor, down-home humor, and an over-all tang of good feeling, but the pushing of buttons is the work of extraordinary calculation.Director John Lee Hancock's only aiming for a crowd pleaser, and by not challenging the established playbook for inspirational sports dramas, he's no doubt got one.The Blind Side is less interesting for its milquetoast biopic character than for Sandra Bullock's inherently likable wealthy do-gooder.'The Blind Side' inspires despite average filmmaking that's incapable of probing deeply enough into the story's racial dynamics.The Blind Side is less interesting for its milquetoast biopic character than for Sandra Bullock's inherently likable wealthy do-gooder.Except for a few crude exchanges,The Blind Side is almost as squeaky-clean as an old Disney movie. Unfortunately, it can also be just as cute and condescending.Hancock sands down the rough spots of Oher's story, but he also polishes to a glow the family ties that grow between Oher and the Touhys.Sing it together with me my brothers, thank the Lawd for he created the white man that he might teach them po' negroes the value of good Christian chariddy.The Blind Side, which has reportedly made close to 200 million dollars, is based on a true story (the operative word is \"based,\" of course).The movie's a pretty conventional feel-good sports drama in many ways. But Bullock and Aaron give it heart that transcends the genre.While it's possible to be enormously entertained and moved by The Blind Side, it's also possible to harbor a twinge of misgiving.Bullock is back - when she tells Coach Cotton how to play Michael, she's like a clove of garlic in an onion bag.It's the deft, simple manner in which the story is told that brings it all together into a feel-good movie that rises above its inherent clich\u00e9sBy avoiding excessive cliche and maintaining a simple and optimistic attitude throughout, and with a healthy dose of comedy, \"The Blind Side\" ends up being one of the best sports films of recent years.SlimyWriter-director John Lee Hancock wants to say something meaningful about racism, but he can't even get the football parts of his film right.There's potential there for cloying, movie-of-the-week formula, but Hancock deftly dodges it. The Blind Side ends up being a tear-jerker, a heart-warmer and a crowd-pleaser all in one.takes what could have been a clich\u00e9 three-hanky tearjerker designed to assuage white guilt and turn it into something deeper and more meaningfulOverall a sweet tale of a kid being given a chance when he seemed all but lost, and the performances of Bullock and Aaron. It's worth a look....

        "document": "Both gripping and wrenching - not to mention thrilling...recalls a slice of recent history that is in danger of being lost.Dispensing with voiceover narration, How to Survive a Plague is instead a compilation of first-person remembrances, a time-toggling polyphony emphasizing both individual struggles against illness and collective action-the we of me.Beautifully inspiring and, obviously, also a great cautionary tale.It can feel inchoate, dropping the viewer in the middle of events without much context, and it exacts an emotional toll. But its raw quality also makes it compelling viewing.When it's over, this documentary lingers as a testament to extraordinary human bravery. It stands as one of the most heartbreaking and suspenseful sagas of the year.If the movie expresses equal measures of sadness and outrage, it is charged with the exhilarating excitement felt by soldiers on the front lines of battle.An exceptional portrait of a community in crisis and the focused fury of its response.[An] unflinching look at the activists' mistakes and acheivements, their regrets, their very solemn pride at a victory attained at so high a cost.Tune in to the passionate voices in David France's brilliant documentary ...Should be invaluable to every frustrated movement, as both a road map and a reminder of how vital personal activism remains.We grow familiar with the names and faces of many of the leaders in the movement. Some look directly into the camera and say they expect to die of the disease. Some are correct.How To Survive A Plague conveys the urgency of activists who were fighting for their lives.An indispensable and moving piece of filmmaking.[A] glorious ode to the supposition that a small group of committed people can change the world...As this stirring, scrupulous doc reveals, the members of ACT UP fused the fervor of revolutionaries, the tenacity of trial lawyers, and the rage of the dispossessed to change the very shape of the epidemic.Plague offers an instructive lesson for Occupy-era rabble-rousers: Only when coupled with a knowledge base will your sound and fury signify anything.It can't be long before we see the Hollywood version.A moving treatment of a deeply personal subject (France's own partner died of an AIDS-related illness in 1992), and an enthralling depiction of a seriously fired-up popular movement.An important, moving doc about how LGBT activism taught a community to shun silence.David France has made an absorbing film to document that moment of immense implosion, called How to Survive a Plague.A documentary on the impact of a passionate group of dedicated and creative individuals in raising awareness of the AIDS epidemic.Moving and essential.At once a fascinating history and a compelling call to action.From a terrible epidemic comes a beautiful documentary.The film is a tribute to political activism and the power of people to change the world.Must-see: Timely, relevant, and informative, this AIDS docu about ACT UP is satisfying on any number of levels, thematically, politically, and emotionally.I don't doubt that anyone who has had a brush with AIDS, lost a friend or even a hero like Queen's Freddie Mercury, will find what is already a socially curious, medically fascinating and politically charged film an unmissably emotional experience.This inspirational, unexpectedly hilarious film is a patchwork of archival footage that takes us up to the present day.It all adds up to not just a document of the time but a blueprint for today's activists.A compellingly watchable portrait of a battle fought under that most memorable rallying cry: \"Silence = Death\". Bravo.David France's documentary about the 1980s/90s American gay community and its leading role in discovering \"combination therapy\" - the anti-HIV magic bullet - will be inspiring among audiences from the G20.Well-made and featuring an astonishing amount of on-the-scene archive footage, this is a powerfully emotional and hugely inspirational documentary that demands to be seen.Nominated for the Oscar, this documentary is one of the most involving and moving films you'll see all year. At its core this is a movie about how a decent society should behave, even to the point of helping people who hurt themselves.One of the most important documentaries in years or decades ...This raw and passionate AIDS treatment doc suffers from a simple lack of focus.It's no whitewash: important activists from the era admit how much time was lost through internecine squabbling, as well as the struggles they faced against the pitiless anti-gay rhetoric of their political opponents.This amazingly well-done, admirably dry-eyed documentary about a true human victory over what was once a universal death sentence might well be the year's finest.This astonishing assemblage of archive material from the ground zero of the AIDS crisis is more than a history lesson - it is a rousing, essential study of human survival.A nightmarish clash comes to life in this devastating montage of inflamed voices, their rage infusing the very grain of '80s videography.A heart-wrenching portrait of one of the saddest, most heroic chapters in American history.France and his crew have sculpted years of old broadcast-news stories and home videos into a narrative that is impressionistic in its scope but coherent in its feeling.This is a moving documentary, as hopeful as it is tragic.A riveting look at LGBT protesters during the AIDS crisis - and an object lesson that if the revolution is going to be televised, it's good to have the revolutionaries holding the cameras.Probably the most moving doc of the year, both devastating and uplifting at the same time, and I can't recommend it enough.How to Survive a Plague presents a cast of characters who must continue fighting, for what's at stake is the very real, very imminent threat of their own deaths.Hindsight allows David France's stirring How to Survive a Plague a concise overview's clarity and an epic narrative shape, with a happy ending to boot.A major addition to the body of work chronicling the AIDS epidemic, this is a passionate account of the hard-won breakthrough in making HIV a manageable condition.Presents a valuable template for how grassroots activism can temper societal prejudice and challenge governmental indifference in the face of a mysterious and remorseless killer.A raw history, often cluttered and sometimes repetitive but, when strategies fail along with immune systems, deeply affecting.What making a difference is really all about!The film puts us right in the moment of the height of the crisis better than any documentary ever has.A brilliant blueprint on how to spark a revolution. The activists who were highlighted in this film are American heroes to us all - gay, straight, black, white, male or female.Mostly the film toggles between two emotions - the high of watching brave people go to war, and the low of seeing so many of them fall, as entire communities are destroyed.France, drawing on a wealth of video footage from inside the organization, turns that decade of rage, despair, and tenacity into an inspiring tale of effective political action.Filmmaker David France...methodically reconstructs the critical period in the fight against AIDS from 1987 to 1995. (It) emerges as the better documentary (than this year's \"United in Anger\") if only due to its slightly more comprehensive perspective.A cinematically sophisticated documentary that actually finds a way to be an intelligent and admirable work of art in addition to its more overt sociological implications.An exquisite collection of archival films graphically portraying the passions pf demonstrators that resulted in the release of drugs to counteract AIDS.One of the most powerful, fascinating and saddest documentaries of the last several years.The title doesn't necessarily convey this, but \"How to Survive a Plague\" is an inspiring and hopeful documentary.A powerful reminder of the ability of committed men and women to agitate, organize and create real change in the world.Compelling, important and inspiring documentary about the fight against AIDS.\"How to Survive a Plague\" captures a saddening, maddening era that seems like far too many lifetimes ago.How to Survive a Plague is thorough almost to a fault.... compelling as a recent historical document, but also has contemporary resonance in its depiction of the influence of activism on social causes.A serious, moving and sometimes astonishingly well-organized documentary about the history of AIDS activism.[A] powerful, messy and tremendously moving documentary ...Plague isn't the history of a disease so much as the history of a movement, and a portrait of those who refused to suffer passively.\"How to Survive a Plague\" thoroughly examines the history of the AIDS crisis and the dedicated members of an activist group (Act-Up) capable of adapting to the lessons it learned along the way.This documentary by David France persuasively argues that one of the greatest grassroots activist campaigns of modern times was the Act Up movement ...Ultimately, the story presented by the former reporter for Boston's defunct Gay Community News is one of hope.",

        "document": "Not only an exuberant portrayal of hip-hop's self-healing, it's a compelling meditation on the future of making music in America.There's plenty of footage here of some of the world's best DJs at work, and it's impressive, even for someone uninterested in the genre.The notion that hip-hop is much more than rapping is a persistent theme, and anyone seeking a solid introduction -- or re-introduction -- to that ever vibrant culture shouldn't miss it.A nifty portrait of a minor, but intriguing, element of popular culture.One of those terrific documentaries that collect a bunch of people who are enthusiastic about something and then figures out how to make us share their enthusiasm.Illuminating if overly talky documentary.A good documentary can make interesting a subject you thought would leave you cold. A case in point: Doug Pray's Scratch.It's a smart, funny look at an arcane area of popular culture, and if it isn't entirely persuasive, it does give exposure to some talented performers.An engrossing and infectiously enthusiastic documentary.Mixes likeable personalities, inventive photography and cutting, and wall-to-wall toe-tapping music to paint a picture of a subculture that is at once exhilarating, silly, perverse, hopeful and always fun.The message of such reflections--intentional or not--is that while no art grows from a vacuum, many artists exist in one.A fine documentary can be distinguished from a mediocre one by the better film's ability to make its subject interesting to those who aren't part of its supposed target audience. Judging by those standards, 'Scratch' is a pretty decent little documentary.\"The turntable is now outselling the electric guitar...\"An energizing, intoxicating documentary charting the rise of hip-hop culture in general and the art of scratching (or turntablism) in particular.If you, like me, have never been convinced that spinning and mixing other people's records requires a musical skill, these guys will educate you as they twiddle and tweak like amped-up octopi.Immersing us in the endlessly inventive, fiercely competitive world of hip-hop DJs, the project is sensational and revelatory, even if scratching makes you itch.Triumphs by profiling a vibrant, underground culture that is as innovative as it is misunderstood.It's a story of turntablism that will appeal to both newcomers and DJ diehards.It's all stitched together with energy, intelligence and verve, enhanced by a surplus of vintage archive footage.Those moviegoers who would automatically bypass a hip-hop documentary should give \"Scratch\" a second look.A determined and carefully made but ultimately unsatisfying effort.Pray's subjects can wander off into arcane Dennis Miller-esque rants, but he manages to hit the high points and most of the major personalities.You don't need to be a hip-hop fan to appreciate Scratch, and that's the mark of a documentary that works.Even as it pays earnest homage to turntablists and beat jugglers, old schoolers and current innovators, Scratch is great fun, full of the kind of energy it's documenting.Pray has really done his subject justice.See Scratch for the history, see Scratch for the music, see Scratch for a lesson in scratching, but, most of all, see it for the passion.Engaging documentary.[A]s entertaining as it is to watch the wheels spin back and forth, it's a closed world. Viewers not already acquainted with hip-hop and deejay culture might feel a little lost here, like watching a foreign-language film with no subtitles.Thanks to so many articulate DJs and terrific footage, the documentary is a must-see for hip-hop fans ...Exciting documentary.Time with this diverse group of record-spinners makes you appreciate them as the groundbreaking musicians they are.Pray has managed to create a historical document accessible enough for novices and credible enough for aficionados.Nothing short of a respectful testament to the ingenious creative drive of the outsider.Edited and shot with a syncopated style mimicking the work of his subjects, Pray turns the idea of the documentary on its head, making it rousing, invigorating fun lacking any MTV puffery.Pray's film works well and will appeal even to those who aren't too familiar with turntablism.Does what a fine documentary does best: It extends a warm invitation into an unfamiliar world, then illuminates it fully and allows the larger implications of the journey to sink in unobtrusively....Pray doesn't have a passion for the material. He nonetheless appreciates the art and reveals a music scene that transcends culture and race.Should appeal to more than just hardcore hip-hop fans.You'll be left with the sensation of having just witnessed a great performance and, perhaps, give in to the urge to get on your feet and shake it.Dense, exhilarating documentary.",

        "document": "The production isn't nearly as creepy as the original and the new invention of Freddy's secret cave is an opportunity for psychological horror squandered.All we can think of is how much we miss the Robert Englund Freddy. Man, that guy knew how to have a killer good time.This would-be franchise reboot seems haunted by its reliance on genre conventions.The film does have positives including a strong performance from Jackie Earle Haley but ultimately fails in delivering tension and scares.By focusing on the monster instead of teen iniquities and daring to move past innuendo into fact, this Nightmare surpasses its predecessors to out-menace them all.Simply put, it's not very scary, and its efforts to do right by the material forget the most basic reason for going to see films like this.Traffics in overly familiar scare tactics, setting up predictable false alarms and telegraphing in advance just when Freddy will pop into the frame and utter one of his labored witticisms.The jump scares, given a little extra oomph by the ever-looming possibility of a double wake-up, do what they're supposed to do. They make you jump.To the audience suckered into paying to see this, here's why your generation sucks.New Freddy, no new scares in this tepid reboot of the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise.Nice try, but they probably should have just left the original Nightmare on Elm Street as is.When producers Michael Bay, Andrew Form and Bradley Fuller go to sleep tonight, it's a safe bet that their dreams will be tormented by Wes Craven and Robert Englund sporting gloves with bladed fingers.Never has the lure of the recognizable been more obvious than in this familiar yet forgettable reboot of Wes Craven's 1980s horror franchise.The movie takes itself way too seriously, like a Medieval Times waiter acting scared of a cell phone.The vintage teen-scream thrills, once so fresh, now seem stale.Somewhere, Wes Craven is laughing up his sleeve, and Robert Englund is grinning. It's nice to know that you're irreplaceable.The set pieces are well created and Jackie Earle Haley does a fine job (don't forget, he's not only dealing with the character but with the knowledge that Robert Englund will always be associated with the role).Drab leads and a lack of any sort of fevered investigative pop make this Nightmare come across like a boring, gory junior detective procedural.Haley is a solid replacement for Englund as the murderous Freddy. He is particularly effective in the scenes of Freddy's earlier life. Although his talent was put to better use in \"Watchmen\" this role should give him employment for years to come.Save yourself the ticket price and buy the original on DVD and see what a true fright is.Lacks imagination, story, good acting and a reason for being.People have dreams and either get their guts ripped out or don't get their gets ripped out. And then, after 90 or so minutes are used up, the movie finds some weak pretext for ending.This moody, lifeless movie rips off lines, scenes, dream sequences and character kills from Craven's film ... while draining them of energy, suspense and meaning.The not-very new Nightmare is indebted to the illogic of dreams, but determinedly dumb about using it.The remake has dumbed-down its source to a genre it always transcended: the slice-and-dice, snip-and-quip gore film.The A Nightmare on Elm Street remake is intelligent, well-acted and great-looking. But if you want to be scared, you're out of luck.There are a lot of things wrong with this remake of A Nightmare on Elm Street, not least of which is that it was made at all.The new Nightmare is a straight, shiny, honorable remake.The basic feeling you get out of this thing is 'been there-done that'.Thanks to the film's re-imagining of Freddy as accused child molester, an uncomfortable veneer of ickiness looms that makes it hard to truly enjoy...Eye-glazingly pointless and totally underwhelming.Bayer's Nightmare is 95 minutes of non-stop crap dialogue, crapper acting and the crappest expositional nonsense I've seen since The Lovely Bones.Jackie Earle Haley's Krueger is a blast, but the child-molester twist is more depressingly clinical than dream-logic harrowing.As pointless remakes go, this is by no means the worst of them, thanks to a decent cast and a liberal use of shock and gore, though the 2010 Freddy is significantly less scary than the original.At least they gave Freddy a back story - that's a good thing. That it made no sense - that's a bad thing.Let's start by naming a few things scarier than the new \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" %u2013 golden retriever puppies, rainbows, chocolate chip cookies, \"Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,\" and flower gardens.The remake is a better movie than most of the later entries in the powerhouse franchise, but it's not a patch on Wes Craven's 1984 original.Haley does what's required of him--which mainly consists of growling and grimacing beneath layers of make up--but there's nothing at all memorable about his performanceWhat we are left with is a higher body count and a faster pace, but no tension. ...Welcome to the low-impact world of modern franchise horror pictures.Memo to Freddy: How can we miss you if you won't stay away?Parental Content ReviewThis is even less inspired and imaginative than the Friday The 13th reboot and makes Rob Zombie's Halloween films feel like the work of an auteur.For a film about the dangers of falling asleep it tried damn hard to make the audience nod off.Like many horror fans, I approached viewing the recent remake of the post-slasher classic with extremely low expectations. Not low enough, though!...it has nothing new to say and works with an original that didn't need remaking.I did jump a few times, and I liked Haley's dour malevolence, but overall, the new Nightmare on Elm Street is a by-the-numbers bad dream.There's really no reason to see this dreadful picture; better to rent the 1984 feature.Freddy's back -- and he's slicker and more sinister than ever.For fans of the Nightmare franchise, and slasher films in general, the new version does exactly what you want and not much more.Ultimately, the remake plays out more like the parade of increasingly daft sequels that milked the last drop of blood out of the Krueger franchise.full review at Movies for the MassesHaley's Krueger doesn't just look like a deeply unhinged burn victim out for gruesome revenge, he is a complete embodiment of evil. And it's terrifying.This is just Nightmare 9 and you can believe this is the real backstory they never told you before, not that nonsense about the three flying heads.a Nightmare just like the ones we've seen before, which is probably why it feels more tiresome than terrifying.To summarize this angry rant: boring, clich\u00e9, too serious and a waste of an icon.Jackie Earle Haley is an excellent successor to the original's Robert Englund. Freddy Krueger isn't just scary again, he's the most disturbing he's ever been.In six months' time, no one will remember this movie. When it's shuffled off to DVD, most of the copies will end up in a landfill.Mindlessly entertaining, slick and stylishly creepy albeit deficient in real surprises and visceral scares. It's a cut above the recent slew of horror remakes.The Nightmare on Elm Street reboot has more in common with the later, lame-o sequels than with the one it is technically remaking.Incredibly bland and unimaginative. It's slow, tedious, and kind of pretentious. Fails to answer the existential question - why do I exist?If not for its title, and the memories it conjures up... the film wouldn't have enough of an impact to last through the end of the credits.ANOES doesn't reinvent the wheel, but there's a solid story with striking death scenes, and that should please the more pragmatic fans on both sides of the demographic.Welcome to 2010, Freddy Krueger. You were scarier in 1984....an unintelligible mess, as if this remake of the slasher-genre favorite is its own dismembered victim.Freddy's back, in all his gory glory, but revisiting him...is less likely to inspire an attack of night terrors than to elicit a bored yawn, followed by a restful sleep...Entirely devoid of personality, music video director Samuel Bayer is unable to handle the flow of a feature film, stuttering from dream sequence to dream sequence without cohesion.It doesn't get any worser than this.Scarred by bad makeup, subpar acting and overall inept storytelling, A Nightmare on Elm Street is a bad dream for fans of the original 1984 movie or anyone who enjoys well made horror films.On film or DVD, Freddy is terrifying for about 15 minutes %u2014 one reel tops. After the first couple of appearances and a kill or two, he is ho-hum.We all know Freddy Krueger (whether we've seen this franchise or not) so we're miles ahead of these static teenage characters, and just waited for them to catch up.No, it isn't necessary. But in this remake, Jackie Earle Haley does a nice job as our favorite knife-fingered terror in \"A Nightmare on Elm Street.\"This is what happens when Gossip Girl has a character with a blemish problem and a stripe-savvy fashion senseThose who are old enough to have fond memories of the original are probably too old for this Nightmare.It's the Bay touch you feel in the way actors register as body count, characters go undeveloped, and sensation trumps feeling. A nightmare, indeed.its primary effect is to leave you less thrilled than simply asking what's the point in remaking something if you can't improve on the original?Do not, let me repeat that, DO NOT, watch the new A Nightmare on Elm Street.After giving a great performance in \"Watchmen,\" what was Jackie Earle Haley doing in this film, besides making a buck or two? Extremely disappointing remake and creepier than the original, but not in a good way. Paul Chambers, CNN.A bland, unncessary return to FreddylandIt's all efficiently done and gory but director Samuel Bayer adds so little to the old familiar scare story that you wonder why they didn't just save a bob or two and reissue the Robert Englund original.To call the film patterned to fit would be a blazing understatement.A recurring Nightmare.Though no worse than the raft of terrible Elm Street sequels, this remake misses some of the surreal and anarchic low-budget energy Craven brought to his film (not to mention Johnny Depp).The nightmare on Elm Street is not how scary (or not) the film is, but how it destroys the franchise.Never quite answers the most essential question for any remake: Is this really necessary?The so-called \"re-imagining\" of A Nightmare on Elm Street isn't a nightmare so much as it is a series of missed opportunities.Perfectly symbolic of the laziness and lack of ingenuity inherent with much of today's plastic Hollywood moviemaking.It's the moments when Bayer goes off-book that are most effective, using modern special effects to augment the dreams in ways that weren't possibly back in the day, on a budget.As an exercise in \"re-imagining,\" to use Hollywood's favorite rehash euphemism, this Nightmare is mostly stale goods.Haley's a fine actor, but he was far scarier in the suburban drama Little Children. And Englund's unpredictable presence is definitely missed.This new Nightmare is almost completely redundant, but Freddy's blades remain sharp enough to guarantee Haley's job security for at least a few years.Like a cover band with more stagecraft than talent, A Nightmare on Elm Street looks good recycling \"greatest hits\" moments but fails to capture the excitement of the original.If there's anything new to be added, the new Nightmare does not do it.2010's Nightmare isn't just flawed, but without any merit whatsoever, amongst the worst of Platinum Dunes' cinematic abortions and as bad, if not worse, than Freddy's Revenge and Freddy's Dead.It's not a good film, but if you're feeling jaded and just want to watch a demonic killer pound his fist through the chest of some hapless, cardboard teenager, then this might just scratch that itch.Is there any movie franchise that cries out less for revisiting than A Nightmare on Elm Street?This trip to Elm Street will give you nightmares, but not the kind they anticipated.Compared to the flamboyance of Robert Englund in the 1980s, Jackie Earle Haley as the crazed Freddy Krueger is more lumbering man-child than demonic daddy.Only a NIGHTMARE for fans of the franchise.This is the worst yet from Michael Bay's horror production company Platinum Dunes, which also brought you rubbish re-makes of Halloween and Friday the 13th.In this outing, however, Wesley Strick and Eric Heisserer's screenplay pulls no punches about Freddy's vicious sadism and paedophilia and, seriously, there's no fun in that.Haley just ain't no Englund, no matter how much he tries.An expectedly worthless horror-movie remake from Michael Bay's production company...Lo%u0161e odra%u0111ena indigo-kopija originala, od strane ne ba%u0161 iskusnog videospota%u0161a Samuela BayeraGood luck staying awake.... Like watching a brilliant garage band's sparse, smart singles turned into loud, expensive, overproduced karaoke sing-along versions with the same notes and lyrics but none of the passion and power.A Nightmare On Elm Street will give me bad dreams of studio executives counting up their filthy lucre made off of a generation willing to accept this sort of spoon-fed garbage and not of the monster they've so completely neutered by this point.A tightly wound experience that gets even more tense as it builds toward its shattering finale.Stylish remake isn't as good as the original, but it has enough genuine scares to merit a mild recommendation.I don't hate the new A Nightmare on Elm Street on principle. I hate the new A Nightmare on Elm Street because it sucks.The film cops virtually every memorable image from the original, but loses the depth that gave them power and the sense of place that grounded them.Bayer's stylish visual direction does little to detract from the fact this is essentially the same movie with far too many visual nods and little to differentiate it or set it apart from the original.While the 1984 film has aged, its now-familiar jolts still pack more punch than this pic's recycled ones, which sometimes register so tepidly as to cause snickers.A flat, lifeless remake that's totally unnecessary, except of course to the studio executives who want to extract still more profit from the property.The real nightmare is the tragic lack of creativity in this new look of one of the genre's greatest characters.I still like the characters from the first film, and these kids were cardboard shadows of them.So generic, so lazy, and so forgettable they may as well have \"we're not even trying\" plastered across the bottom of the screen.It replaces the fascinating context of Freddie Krueger's existence with a seemingly endless exercise in violence and unrelenting pain.Many people have already made the mistake of holding this film up to the original, expecting it to be just as good, but it just isn't. However, taken on its own, it's still an entertaining horror film and an interesting take on the material.An homage to Craven's vision that is believably earnest in execution and completely faithful in spirit.This Elm Street reeks of a rushed cash-grab, as even the most reliable of clich\u00e9d shocks fail to register on the fright-o-meter.This flimsy remake is a nightmare and unworthy of your time.Mara and Gallner make an attractive couple on the lam and Haley, as Freddy Krueger, hams it up to an almost alarming degree.Haley offers a darker, meaner take on the iconic character.It's well-made and rattles along at a fair old pace, predictably leaving the way open for another 130-odd deaths in the inevitable glut of sequels.Whereas Wes Craven's '84 original kept you unsure as to whether you were witnessing dreams or reality, director Samuel Bayer's remake color-codes the transitions. How helpful!He's survived six sequels, a grudge match with Jason Voorhees and a terrible TV spin-off, but this remake may finally finish Freddy Krueger once and for all.Freddy Kruger deserves better and so do we.Where the original was joltingly inventive and disturbing, this is just second-hand fright.The real problem with A Nightmare on Elm Street 2010 is: it's really unbelievably dull.This is the worst yet from Michael Bay's horror production company Platinum Dunes, which also brought you rubbish re-makes of Halloween and Friday the 13th.While Haley makes for a decent Freddy, other members of the cast kill the party.The remake of A Nightmare On Elm Street only serves to tarnish the legacy of the original franchise, substituting any creative flair with bogstandard writing and direction.Surely the point of any remake is to find something new in the material that brings it to a new audience. But all these filmmakers have done is rehash the groundbreaking original into another lifeless, cliche-filled slog.I've seen far worse horror remakes, but let's not grade on too much of a curve: This Nightmare offers dutifully grinding thrills of a routine sort.It's a movie that starts slowly, and only starts moving us to the edge of our seat in the third act, adequate for a horror picture, but no more.There hasn't been this unnecessary of a back story since Ron Howard felt the need to dramatize the childhood of one Mr. Grinch.Nancy who? Freddy did what? What's the razor glove about? These kids have parents? Bayer's more interested in the lighting design than he is winding a dazzling tale of mental invasion and teen paranoia.Freddy's 2010 makeover made him look like a burn victim meets a Na'vi creature from 'Avatar.' Also, for a movie that is about its characters fighting sleep to survive, it's a shame 'Elm Street' induces a few REM-driven naps.Using blasts of shrill, high-decibel noise in place of actual scares has become a common horror-movie tactic, the cinematic equivalent of botox, silicone, and penile-enhancement surgery.I stared at A Nightmare on Elm Street with weary resignation. The movie consists of a series of teenagers who are introduced, haunted by nightmares and then slashed to death by Freddy. So what?The novelty has long since worn off, and cheap, generic scares are all that are left.In a way, Freddy finally makes sense in this version of Elm Street, but Robert Englund's original Freddy is still preferable to Haley's pervy Groundskeeper Willy.Too many more remakes as dull and bland as A Nightmare on Elm Street could kill off horror movies for good.Where Craven's film was campy, Bayer's movie is just plain dark.Look at it this way: At least you won't fall asleep.Far more disturbing than entertaining.The result of the new Nightmare is, at best, a kind of stand-off between predictability and competent execution.Samuel Bayer's remake of Wes Craven's A Nightmare on Elm Street may be about repressed memories coming back in horrific ways, but it ironically ends up one of the least memorable films of 2010 to date.A Nightmare on Elm Street is a movie about people trying not to doze off. Having just watched it, I know how they feel.Dream killer Freddy Krueger made a generation of moviegoers scared to fall asleep. Too bad his return to the big screen is such a snooze.You'd think Jackie Earle Haley as pedophile Freddy would kill. Oh, hardly.A Nightmare on Elm Street may be the most unneeded movie of the year. And that's saying something.While it's visually appealing, the new Elm Street fails to sustain momentum or create much genuine tension.After the incompetence exuded by Samuel Bayer here, I feel confident in saying it is time to put his feature film career to sleep for good.As the various teenagers fight to stay awake, you may find yourself doing exactly the same.Unadventurous, devoid of personality and completely lacking any semblance of imagination, Samuel Bayer's new Nightmare is a textbook exercise straight out of generic horror remakes 101.The bastard film of 100 idiots.The bottom line is that it isn't just Elm Street that's affected; you'll find a nightmare on any street that's housing a theater with the misfortune to be playing this monstrosity.Caso existisse, Freddy Krueger poderia usar este filme como um \u00f3timo recurso para levar suas v\u00edtimas ao sono.A film that shows they're not even attempting creativity because with horror fans lowering their standards more and more, why should they even try?Photocopies much of Wes Craven's original 1984 classic, but makes senseless changes that destroy the story's night-terror integrity.Complete lack of imagination.Does it matter that the plot is little more than a cynical, machine-tooled retread of the 1984 original? Debut director Samuel Bayer was not hired to dismantle the franchise but to shoot it afresh.The idea that repressed or concealed knowledge of child abuse can emerge years later to traumatize victims and family members has rarely had more currency, but this slack remake is neither persuasive nor scary.We watch a bunch of twentysomething catalog-model types with last names for first names impersonate high schoolers who keep getting slashed up in their dreams.Fails to mimic or update with any competence.One dreary jump scare after another, without a moment to breathe, show something revealing about one of its doomed teens, or deliver a single line of dialogue that isn't dully and directly on-point.As is the case with most remakes, this one is pretty pointless.Ol' Cusinart Hand is back in A Nightmare on Elm Street, a pointless, unimaginative \"re-imagining\" of Wes Craven's cleverly conceived slasher movie.For all his calculated bumps in the night and shots of creepy-looking preschoolers moping around a boiler room, Bayer misses the little things that made the original so hard to forget. Craven was right to keep his distance from this one.",

        "document": "Part live action cartoon, part love letter to the cinema, Kung Fu Hustle is one of a kind.I can only assume Stephen Chow's Kung Fu Hustle is the first chop-socky extravaganza to lift entire passages of dialogue from Jean Renoir's Rules Of The Game.You don't take any of this seriously for a minute, but you can't take your eyes off the screen.Chow's aesthetic demands an appreciation of the absurd: The events are often silly even as the ideas and feeling behind them are not.For all his cleverness and flights of fantasticated fancy, the director proves himself an unabashedly romantic filmmaker, and there aren't enough of those.The heir apparent to Jackie Chan, [Stephen] Chow creates a world where kung fu comedy fuses with a Roadrunner cartoon and The Matrix ...A film that is not only very entertaining, but also emotionally satisfying for a broad international audience.As... Shawn of the Dead did for zombie pictures, Kung Fu Hustle does for chop sockey: both honor and spoof the genre that spawned it.Not so much hustle, a lot of kung fu, and a surreal cartoon ride inbetween.What makes Chow unique, perhaps even revolutionary, is that he is the first movie comedian to consistently make hilarious use of digital effects.A kung fu parody that's also a terrific kung fu movie.Does the plot spin out of control? You bet. But dumb fun this smart is a gift.Martial arts action as jaw-dropping as Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon or The Matrix filtered through 'The Three Stooges' and 'Looney Tunes'Kung Fu Hustle delivers as an action-comedy-musical. Its fiendishly entertaining most of the time, but its flimsy plot is a just an excuse for Chow's histrionicsChow, perhaps the first action star and filmmaker to be as influenced by classic cartoons as by the karate-chop balletics of human movement, directs like a gonzo fusion of Tarantino and Tex Avery.Viewers will discover that the film has something to offer nearly everyone, whether they are a novice or a black belt in kung fu cinema.An almost exhaustingly inventive action comedy that uses every available trick.A delirious-verging-on-surreal send-up of Kung Fu attitudes and traditions mutated with a Tex Avery cartoon.Simple ideas resound the loudest in Hustle, never the overtly choreographed fights or blistering visual effects. Chow is at his best when it's just him to contend with....half homage to old kung-fu movies, half sheer comic goofiness...The laws of physics no longer apply, if they ever did; characters leap, run at neck-breaking speed, bash each other through several walls with one blow.While those who can't stand long fight scenes might find it a bit tiresome, everyone else is going to consider this a sweet, light-hearted martial arts treat.A film that is geared simply, straightforwardly and, above all, honestly to providing absolute entertainment.So disarmingly eager to please that only a stone-faced kung fu purist could object.Gravity takes a backseat to levity.Keeps the gags flying almost as rapidly as the fists.A smart and very funny action comedy that will really knock your socks off.The ever-shifting genre of martial arts films takes on yet another variation with writer/director/actor Stephen Chow's CGI spectacle infused comic Kung Fu adventure.Chow is a genius in generating extraordinary drama from the familiar.Slapstick silliness and martial artistry of the highest calibre....the knockdown hilarity of it all made me wonder where this subgenre of martial-arts action flick might be heading. A lot of it is riotously funny.The latest film from Hong Kong's reigning comic star and director, Stephen Chow ... is a celebration of Hong Kong action cinema that mocks gravity, both emotional and physical.Being a movie critic is like being a prospector: After almost 30 years of exploring terrain, you can stumble upon a streak of pure gold you've never seen. From the looks of Kung Fu Hustle, Stephen Chow is a mother lode.It's a wild laugh fest where anything goes and often does so at the speed of light.Ridiculous? Nah. Kung Fu Hustle is sublime entertainment.At times, Kung Fu Hustle feels like too much of a good thing.So filled with crazy energy that it seems to leap off the screen, Kung Fu Hustle is the most wildly inventive, purely entertaining and cuckoo-cool flick to hit movie houses this year...If anything, this Hustle is more frantic, more frenetic, more cartoonish - and more enjoyable - than filmmaker Stephen Chow's previous film, Shaolin Soccer.Like a meal prepared by an extreme chef, 'Hustle is more than a bit of a mess. It still tastes like nothing you've ever had before.It may not be a classic, but 'Kung Fu Hustle' is a playful, unpredictable comedy, overflowing with the impishly clever personality of its maker.Stephen Chow's peculiar vision of an action - comedy - musical - drama. For over-the-top excess, this takes pride-of-place.With everything bigger and grander in Chow's singular universe, it's easy to overlook one small detail...that Kung Fu Hustle is less satisfying than its predecessors.Absurd insanity that would make even Jackie Chan gaspDerivative, repetitive, and over the top to the point of weariness....like a smorgasbord of high-pitched artistry and homages...A technically expert and visually seductive tour de force from someone who is very likely the funniest man in Asia.Avoids the slickness and self-congratulatory winks of many other comic action films.Wildly funny and inventive, a giddy re-imagining of martial-arts flicks that might be one of the most audaciously entertaining films of the year.Not only is it hilariously funny, but it's also a fiendishly entertaining (albeit somewhat cartoonish) action movie.Chow's screen persona lies somewhere between the poise of Bruce Lee and the comedic timing of pre-Hollywood Jackie Chan, with a little Looney Toons thrown in for extra kickKung Fu Hustle will not only please martial-arts fans, it's witty and energetic enough to engage those who usually ignore such choreographed Asian dust-ups.Kung Fu Hustle is inventive, wild and completely pointless.Chow has created a hyper-animate fantasy world that honors kung fu movies as it satirizes them, and the similarities between it and a cartoon are entirely intentional.A slaphappy cartoon in any language...Thaaaat's all, folks....has a nasty streak that is at odds with the otherwise genial mood Chow creates.There's nothing in Kung Fu Hustle you haven't seen before, but you've never seen it put together in quite this way.Hatchet fu, shotgun fu, flowerpot fu, harp fu, cobra fu, disco fu, Zen fu, Kubrick fu, Road Runner fu, geezer fu, bullfrog fu. Kung Fu Hustle features every type of fu except d\u00e9j\u0155 fu.Though I applaud kung-foolery and find Chow nimbly hilarious, Kung Fu Hustle's shotgun marriage of slapstick and brutality is unnerving in the make-'em-laugh, make-'em-gag manner of Quentin Tarantino.The action is so absurd and clever that it taps the funny bone more than the adrenal glands.Must we say it? Do the Hustle.Low-brow but involving, and never predictable, this is a feast even for those who can't stand subtitles.Kung Fu Hustle, from Asian star Stephen Chow, is the sort of total entertainment package that tends to exhilarate the viewer or grind him down into a spent grist of weariness. Or even both.Toss into a blender Kill Bill, Roadrunner cartoons, the Matrix films and the complete Three Stooges and Jackie Chan collections, and push pur\u00e9e. Pour the result onto a movie screen and call it Kung Fu Hustle.Rockets forward on creative sparks of pure adrenaline and excitement we rarely find outside of carnival rides.Retrieving the martial arts movie from the gentrified middlebrow tastefulness of movies like House of Flying Daggers is only one item on Kung Fu Hustle's agenda.But for all its stylishness, verve and moments of visual poetry, the relentlessly punishing slapstick and overall cruel tone left me cold.Kung Fu Hustle is destined to be the next Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon -- a subtitled movie for people who don't do subtitles.With Hustle's release on 2,000 U.S. screens this week, Americans get to see what's so funny about Chow. The laugh's on them for not noticing him before.Broad, low farces with little story and stuffed with epic fights built on plainly impossible, plainly faked gags, they're still a stitch.When I saw the woman drop a flower pot on her husband's head, a scene straight out of The Bank Dick, it struck me that Chow was channeling W.C. Fields.Brilliantly original and very highly recommended.Those looking for martial arts magic here will find they've been hustled, too.With a delirious mix of the sublime and the silly, Hong Kong comedy king Stephen Chow Sing-chi has taken the kung fu comedy genre to new heights of chop-socky hilarity.Imagine a movie in which Wile E. Coyote, Jackie Chan and The Three Stooges share top billing. That's Kung Fu Hustle.A chop-socky on f/x steroids that's devoid of genuine inspiration or involving character development.It's quite possible that we can hand the title Most-fun Movie of 2005 to this romp.Like Shaolin Soccer, the film is positively insane, a genre-defying spectacle of postmodern signs colliding at rates seemingly faster than the speed of light.The supreme battles are brushed away by the ultimate battles and the ultimate battles are pushed aside by even more absolute battles.Stephen Chow masterfully blends and bends genres like no other, and Hustle is no exception.(Kung Fu) Hustle is a rapid-paced conglomerate of action and laughs, mixed with special effects that look like they were lifted from a Warner Bros. cartoon.A full-on-the-mouth, sloppy-wet kiss to Hong Kong martial arts movies.Hilarious, thrilling, toon-like martial arts flick that's an absolute joy to watch.The second half suffers somewhat, but only in the sense that the inspired gags slow down to one or two per frame. More, please, and soon.Kung Fu Hustle is so over-the-top that it could break Sly Stallone's wrist and stall his big rig circa 1987...It's a short, sharp, shock to the cinematic system that's virtually impossible to dislike, and if you don't leave the theatre grinning your face off, then, buddy, movies just aren't for you.A nonstop orgy of madcap martial arts mayhem.Stephen Chow's giddy genre grab bag of a movie is infectiously silly, breathtaking and easily the most exhilarating pure kung fu movie in years....it's a shame about the R rating: Most of these fights are so cartoony that there's no reasonable danger of children copying them, and they're sure to enjoy the movie.The film mercilessly mocks martial arts films to such a divine degree that it manages to transcend the genre.Giant action sequences, funny characters, and, my favourite, a giant hand carved into the earth, whomping the bad guy into submission. So much fun.A strange, fun flick that loves its source material dearly, Kung Fu Hustle is destined to become a cult classic.Simultaneously and paradoxically irreverent and loving. A terrific piece of cinematic entertainmentChow's movie may seem nutty on the surface, but its slyness, its dreamy unfolding of so many moods and genres, becomes intoxicating.Kung Fu Hustle flies by on bursts of dizzying slapstick invention. There's rarely a dull moment, but the wise-guy tone and the non-stop frenzy wear you down.More like a cartoon populated with human actors.Invigorating, bombastic, out-there and very funny.A film where special effects erase physics and the constraints of the human body, there's absolutely no telling what will come next.Few directors in world cinema are working so competently and consistently in any mode as Chow is in this one.Kung Fu Hustle is made with such infectious humour and gee-whiz visuals it's easy to simply surrender all over again to Chow's brand of lunacyWhen I saw it at Sundance, I wrote that it was 'like Jackie Chan and Buster Keaton meet Quentin Tarantino and Bugs Bunny.' You see how worked up you can get, watching a movie like this.The hugely enjoyable Kung Fu Hustle races across the screen in a colorful collage of kung fu films, silent comedies and Tex Avery and Chuck Jones cartoons.[C]ompletely pointless except as a silly diversion... and that, when you need to check out from the all-too-palpable insanity of the real world... is a very good thing.Kung Fu Hustle has a new spin on an old genre...a better movie for lovers of the kung fu genre because they'll get the jokes, but still funnyThe film doesn't make much story sense at times, but it's a forgivable flaw as \"Kung Fu Hustle\" is one of the most entertaining movies I've seen in yearsIrresistibly peppy and absurd in all the right ways... guaranteed to deliver more innovative eye candy and smarter fun-per-second than most of this summer's fare.If you're not entertained, it's time to get off the decaf.While his film has no shortage of extraordinary special effects, they are musical rather than mechanical. They animate rather than stifle the imagination.A lively, visual treat.As an exercise in craftsmanship it's certainly a success, but in the end it offers lots of sound and fury but not a great deal else.The truth is that I haven't seen nearly enough unimaginative martial-arts movies to respond to Mr. Chow's bizarre flights of fancy.Don't expect a masterpiece of an action movie, but a masterpiece of a comedy that happens to take the martial arts as its theme.When the villains of Kung Fu Hustle introduce themselves with a swishy line dance, you know you're in for something special.In the end what Chow has here is a good gag, not, as he seems to think, a genre.Thumbing its nose at gravity, deflating Zen solemnity, embracing big-top artifice with childish glee, Kung Fu Hustle zings you with some of the most unfettered slapstick ever put on film.Chow's best all-around achievement, meshing a coherent story, character arcs..., and technical depth.A deep river of imagination flows through Stephen Chow's indiscriminate fairy tale.While it needs emotional coherence and better timing, it offers manic, madcap, wacky, over-the-top kung-fu justice.Joyfully chaotic and impishly outrageous, Kung Fu Hustle has a schizophrenic imagination in the way it insists on presenting its wacky charmThe humor may be lowbrow, but the Looney Tunes timing is impeccable.Probably the most imaginative film thus far of 2005...It would seem all but impossible not to have a good time watching Kung Fu Hustle...Here, finally, is the first must-see movie of 2005.For all its excitement Kung Fu Hustle is mostly a marvel of comedic ingenuity and mile-a-minute creativity run wild. You've never seen anything like it.Lingering on such details is a new development for Chow, recalling the style of another aspirant to global pop cinema, Sergio Leone. Given all the hyperbolic kung fu, it's easy to overlook such quietly observant grace notes.Chow packs a lot of action, a crazed cascade of comedy, a parade of characters and a non-stop barrage of loving jabs at classic martial-arts adventures into 99 minutes.Le film transpire le plaisir.Chow's comic flair calls to mind Jackie Chan at his pre-Hollywood peak.Kung Fu Hustle isn't much more than a series of embellishments, but when you're talking about a movie that puts this much cartoon crunch into its violence, it may not matter.Imagine a Jackie Chan movie on amphetamines and steroids with an LSD chaser, and you get some idea of what Stephen Chow's new movie Kung Fu Hustle is like.The hugely enjoyable Kung Fu Hustle races across the screen in a colorful collage of various styles, from classic kung fu films to silent comedies to Tex Avery and Chuck Jones cartoons.a maniacally comical blitzkrieg of slapstick humor, movie parody, musical numbers, and chop-socky actionAn enjoyable but lightweight kung fu movie.an overload of giddy action and physical comedyExudes untroubled mirth.Kung Fu Hustle snaps and crackles like nuclear popcorn on a scorching griddle.It's an explosion of solid silly fun.The fighting scenes are so ridiculous that they ultimately achieve gloriousness...Kung Fu Hustle sweeps you away with its unrepentant silliness.Alive with more wit and mischief than any movie to hit theaters so far this year.Kung Fu Hustle is essentially one long computer-enhanced Looney Tunes punch-up - - and probably the most fun you'll have at the movies all year.An entertaining theatrical outing that is always amusing and visually attractive.Dono de um senso de humor interessant\u00edssimo, Stephen Chow recorre constantemente ao absurdo para provocar o riso do espectador.\"Hustle\" attempts to bring a different style to the forefront of popular cinema but fails to be more than a shoddy mischaracterization of the Asian culture.The best time you'll have at the movies all year.Stephen Chow is a nut--and I mean it with the utmost affection.A deliriously enjoyable roller-coaster ride of a movie, from which you're liable to emerge punch-drunk, grinning from ear to ear and demanding to go round again...it's so refreshing to see a movie willing to be spontaneous and uninhibited.Great fun, even if the genre-bending is a little grating.What a good time. Got all those Lucas cooties out of my system, that's for sure.Kung Fu Hustle is an absolute hoot.With its m\u00e9lange of influences, Kung Fu Hustle is everything, and with its lack of emotional coherence, it's nothing.It is everything KILL BILL wanted to be, but actually wasn't.I've never been a big fan of that over the top slapstick stuff.It is at once a coming of age story, a gangland epic, a martial arts melee, a romantic comedy and dissertation on spirituality.There is so much slapstick humor, so many comic book like characters and outrageous special effects that Kung Fu Hustle should easily cross demographicsListen, it's a fun movie. I should probably shut up and let you enjoy it.You don't have to be a kung-fu freak to revel in the film's energetic silliness, but it helps.Kung Fu Hustle boasts not just audacious action, but tons of laughs, a likeable (in spite of himself) hero in the seemingly hapless Sing, and one kick-ass, foul-mouthed, and awe-inspiring Landlady.The imagination lies not in the film's fight choreography, but in the way it mines Hollywood clich\u00e9s for off-kilter comedy.You'll either love it or feel hustled.An entertaining cartoon, but if there is anything more to it than that, it gets lost in translationAbout the only thing missing is a good dose of fart jokes, but then this movie stinks enough without them.A brilliant kung fu \"nonsense style\" special effects action/comedy film.Rock crumbles, wood splinters, and cartoon sound effects yelp in Chow's full-bore looney tune.Satire, parody, slapstick and just plain comedy combine with some pretty spiffy martial arts moves to make this one of the season's most entertaining films.Can a movie be hilarious and violent simultaneously? Well, yes, if it's \"Kung Fu Hustle.\"...an exhilarating martial-arts extravaganza that barely allows pause for breath.Stephen Chow's pure, pop blast of martial arts action, giddy physical comedy and sheer movie love bursts off the screen.A lush piece of entertainment! Wow! Big action. Big comedy. Big heart. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll laugh and cry at the same time.If the plot elements seem like a duck soup of every Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan picture ever conceived, they are lifted into a whole other stratosphere of ingenuity by Chow and his design team's indefatigable visual imagination.One thing's for sure, if you love cartoons, martial arts, humor and fun...this flick's for you.A lively, action-packed and witty piece of globalist entertainment.Chow knows what his audience wants, and what that audience wants appears to be utter comedic insanity.Stephen Chow's kinetic, exhausting, relentlessly entertaining film throws scraps of a half-century of international pop culture into a fast-whirling blender.inspired silliness at 100 mphAn underdog story disguised as a fairy tale and an action-packed kung fu free-for-all, Hustle is simultaneously one of weirdest and most wonderful films of the year so far.Mayhem doesn't get much more fun than Kung Fu Hustle makes it.The soundtrack is cool, the action is hot, and the laughs are numerous.

        "document": "There's an element of relatable humanity missing from the foundation of trying to tell a story that could have taken six hours in 144 minutes, but there's no denying the power of those 144 minutes.By the end you're left with a question worth asking: What is the best way to put your ideals on the line in any country, in any era?Edel uses documentary tropes to realize his overarching narrative, and the end result is an electrifying, morally complex story of the evil that men (and women) do in the name of the greater good.It does take awhile for the plot to really kick into gear. Yet the discussion of terrorist morality is interesting, and there are some very tense sequences.The Baader Meinhof Complex arrives as a useful tool, a history lesson in a box, on a moment in time when actual revolution seemed not only possible but in some cases likely, in parts of Western Europe and the United States.This sprawling portrait of the Red Army Faction... is neither an apologetic for the anarchist gang nor a condemnation of it, but rather a fascinating exploration of the shift in the zeitgeist of that era...There are some literally killer performances here, most notably Johanna Wokalek as Gudrun.There's a fine line to walk when making a film about outlaws: A few wrong moves and, presto, glamorization occurs. To its credit, The Baader Meinhof Complex almost entirely avoids this pitfall.Edel doesn't force an interpretation on the audience: instead his film provides an experience which raises questions rather than answering them.A thoroughly engrossing tale of conflicting agendas and thwarted ambition. In its verve and verisimilitude, the film recalls such classics of political cinema as Z and The Battle of Algiers.Brilliantly directed and written by Uli Edel, this takes a fascinating but faithful view of violent urban guerillas told basically from the terrorists' POV.A rare epic that deserves every minute of its epic length.Edel -- perhaps wisely -- doesn't leave you much time to reflect ... as his jagged narrative rockets along like a Godard film without a subtext, propelled by violent deeds and misguided, murky, irrational motives.Impressive in its scale and momentum, it's the kind of action-packed political melodrama that generates more heat than light.The Baader Meinhof Complex is a taut and involving thriller that is at its strongest when it focuses on the ideological evolution of Ulrike Meinhof (Martina Gedeck).Very good, very smart, very clear.A fragmented but fascinating glimpse of the famous German terrorist group and their violent legacy.... an exhaustive account of how a gang of self-appointed urban guerrillas traumatized Germany during the decade following the global paroxysms of 1968.Hustling like a blockbuster action flick, it's a crash course in domestic terrorism as rock n' roll adrenaline rush.The Baader-Meinhof Complex is diluted by too many events and characters distributed over too much time.An explosive performance by Johanna Wokalek gives some relief to an otherwise long and humdrum series of characters, blow-'em-ups and prison locations.Engrossing on many levels -- except for, fatally, an emotional one.an kai synarpastiko mathima neoteris eyropaikis istorias se apsogo tehnika perityligma entonoy politikoy thriler, prospathontas na horesei ena toso megalo kai pykno hroniko, se diarkeia tainias, afinei ektos estiasis pragmata poy tha aksizan tainion apo mA long but powerful true-life drama of 1970s German terrorists features masterful storytelling and bravura performances.Pumped with energy and authenticity, this film recounts the tumultuous events in 1960s and 70s Germany with vivid detail and an involving cast of characters. It's breathtaking filmmaking, in every sense of the word.Edel wisely reveals the charismatic qualities of the terrorist leadership: without this element it would be impossible to understand just how popular the Gang became with the young.This impressively mounted and thoroughly researched film is so watchable, whatever one's views about its fanatical participants.Impressively directed and superbly written, this is an engaging, thought-provoking and thoroughly gripping thriller with terrific performances from two of Germany's biggest stars.The Baader Meinhof Complex is the latest autopsy on an important and under-dramatised segment of European history. Those who do not learn from it risk being among those who might repeat it.His approach has simply been to cram everything he knows about the Baader Meinhof years into a running time of two and a half hours. It is really the most unhelpful and unenlightening film on the subject you could possibly imagine.A richly detailed, emotionally complex, character-filled examination.It's not surprising the film was Germany's 2008 submission for a Best Foreign Language Film Oscar.An epic look at a recent blood-soaked episode of post-war Germany.The acting is top drawer and everyone behind the camera is technically proficient with a workmanlike approach. The monumental task of editing by Alexander Berner deserves special mention.It doggedly refuses easy ways out, and it has the guts, brains and critical eye to plumb the roots of terror and its bloody consequences.Merely lets the facts of forty years ago speak for themselves, and one can't deny that its dramatization of them has enormous energy and urgency.Part thriller, part social history, this tense 2008 drama traces the rise and fall of the Baader-Meinhof gang.The Baader-Meinhof Complex is not an easy film to watch; its violence is ugly and brutish. And there's a lot of it.An exciting, infuriating, combative experience.It'd be nice to see an American filmmaker commit a similar reckoning with the Watts riots, the Weather Underground, or the Black Power movement, not simply resort to cant and kitsch but to really interpret those moments.I'd have been happy if this 2.5-hour film had been even longer than it is because, despite its immediacy and the skill with which the events are recreated, it only scratches the surface.At its most arresting when it dwells in the ambiguity that clouds seemingly righteous action.It has that German virtue of clarity, but not much depth of analysis. It certainly doesn't romanticise the terrorists.In trying to cram a great deal into 150 minutes, the filmmakers necessarily jump scenes like puddles, and sometimes the audience gets lost. But I can excuse this flaw; for one thing, the patchwork or montage style provides the time frameEdel uses a variety of film stocks to match the patchiness of the vintage footage he weaves into his narrative, adding to the authentic feel. If he meanders off track at times, it is because there is much to cover here. This could easily have been a longTo do full justice to this fascinating subject, you'd need a director with something like Martin Scorsese's appetite for detail, capacity for spectacle, and willingness to face up to his own ambivalence.You want to know more and Eichinger's script isn't even going to try to enlighten you. The action surges on to the next act of destruction, where Edel's uninflected style works much more effectively.Brilliantly made and utterly compelling from beginning to end.The film highlights the ugliest side of human nature and as a result it is a sobering experience, reinforcing the futility of violenceFascinating history, very good movie - but demanding, and its lack of easy answers will frustrate some. Lessons about 21st century terrorism are implicit, but not overly stressed.The film crams a vast amount of information into two-and-a-half hours, and makes an honest, intelligent attempt to portray terrorism from every angle, including the victims' and authorities' viewpoints.Despite the convincing cast and hefty running time, there's no space left for reflection and insight.It's an impressive achievement lent extra weight by masterful performances from Bleibtrau, Gedeck and Wokalek as the conflicted terrorists who became psychologically shredded by the unstoppable force the RAF had become.The Baader-Meinhof Complex, directed by Uli Edel from a screenplay by Bernd Eichinger, represents a darker vision of the period that, given the ongoing war on terror and fear about home-grown militants, seems especially timely.There are plenty of suspect devices and home-made bombs duct-taped to alarm clocks here, but we never find out what makes their creators tick.There is a real problem with a film that, although thoroughly researched and directed with integrity, struggles to move the audience.Along with Downfall, with whom it shares a screenwriter, this is among the greatest of the recent new wave of German films.As an action-packed pageant of events it is excitingly demonstrative and provocative, but as human drama it proves a mite too enigmatic and unyielding.This fascinating story may not be entirely accurate but it is certainly an engrossing film.A fascinating story, well-made, but also rather lumbering and lacking in any real focus.Never let it be said that when the Germans put their mind to something they don't follow through.I have seen The Baader Meinhof Complex three or four times now, and, despite exasperation with its fissile form, I find it impossible not to be plunged afresh into this engulfing age of European anxiety.For their part, Edel and Eichinger have given an under-explored episode in recent European history a serious and seriously entertaining treatment that stands on its own cinematically and historically.Even though its purpose couldn't be more serious, its style could hardly be more pulp. Which is probably fitting for a group that started out with high-minded goals and ended up robbing banks and blowing people away.The Baader Meinhof Complex isn't, very: This saga of Communist terrorists sowing mayhem in 1970s Germany treats a bloody band as a unit of stouthearted warriors sallying forth to fight for their principles against impossible odds.This dramatic film documents a decade of near-anarchy in Germany, beginning with a brutal 1967 police riot.An initially riveting and provocative thriller filled with intense action sequences and strong performances, but the suspense and thrills wane as the convoluted plot becomes slightly dull and monotonous....cowriter/producer Bernd Eichinger, who gave such depth to a much shorter historical period in \"Downfall,\" here eventually loses his audience by refusing to streamline his cast and focus on a few significant events. It's a 10 part miniseries stuffed inA fiery action film with lots more on its mind.This starkly unromantic epic ultimately benefits from its 150-minute running time, immersing the audience in the RAF's journey from shared passion to collective madness as their movement runs its full, sad, bloody course.The Baader Meinhof Complex is a terrific entertainment, an action packed look at anarchy in the streets followed by the specious slacker malaise argued behind closed doors.... the detail is fascinating and it is mesmerizing to watch this idealistic rebellion swamped by obsession, revolutionary fervor and the psychotic drive of Andreas Baader...Filmed through tear gas and broken glass, Edel graphically depict the horrific violence (the group was responsible for nearly 30 deaths) while equally layering in substance.An impressive period reconstruction and a ripping yarn that never reduces its complicated and conflicted characters to stereotypes ... one of the best action movies of last year and a thoughtful essay on the futility of violence.This flick was written by Stefan Aust, long-time editor of Der Spiegel, Germany's version of Time Magazine. Hence the lurid, superficial and reactionary tilt. The Baader-Meinhof gang was disgusting, but nearly as disgusting as the people they fought.A stirring, bloodcurdling terrorist drama.A glossy, pulse pounding pure Hollywood-style thriller designed for the express purpose of demythologizing its protagonists.A sweeping docudrama of recent history in Germany regarding home-grown terrorism.The 150-minute-long, Oscar-nominated foreign-language film, based on a 1987 book, has a rat-a-tat pace and a lurid, film noir quality that captures the chaos and hysteria of the era that bred and sustained them.One of the ten best films of 2009Baad and Baader extreme women rule, in this bold, more-than-meets-the eye brand of moviemaking, while the impassioned political thriller dissects the Red Army Faction's ideological seduction of actually one fourth of the German population.One the rare examples of historical fiction that manages to defuse a violent series of real-life events to the point of disinterest.This isn't revisionist history; it's a key moment in political radicalism reduced to an empty pop-cultural posture.Watching The Baader-Meinhof Complex is like a trip to a recent past that is too easily forgotten.The movie has an undeniable sweep, increasing in intensity once the principals are arrested in June 1972.A throwback to American filmmaking of the '70s, a pulse-pounding political thriller that grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go until the inevitable bloody conclusion; Germany's Bonnie and Clyde, with a political conscience.Meticulous and fascinating, this stark look at ideological terrorism within a democracy . . remains gripping because of the three captivating central figures.A taut, unnerving, forcefully unromantic film.Simultaneously absorbing and alienating...a watery historic stew crammed with too many events and not enough context or character development to fill out what could have been a compelling film.",

        "document": "Stands there with a straight face and tells us it's an inspiring, ennobling story of dedication and triumph ... when in fact it's an utterly derivative, 100-percent-recycled, completely forgettable story of dedication and triumph.The story of Akeelah's ascent to the finals of the National Spelling Bee makes an uncommonly good movie, entertaining and actually inspirational, and with a few tears along the way.A Karate Kid-esque story of a intelligent girl that battles against the pressure to 'keep it real'...and wins.Atchison finds a very clever and moving way in the final scene to illustrate the film's \"it takes a village\" message.This is the kind of movie that makes a great family film. It's inspirational, moving, funny, and gives you a young hero to root forDramatically jerry-rigged in every possible way.The audience for this slender effort is still in grade school with little new and different to recommend it for anyone older than, say, the age of 12.Akeelah not only embodies her gift and her passion, but she also inspires new ways of thinking about intellectual activities.. . . uniquely thrilling as we watch a young Black girl come alive, not through song or dance but on her own mental steam.Palmer is so good. She's a charmer, bright and talented and sympathetic. And she's only 12.If there's ever any evidence that originality and predictability aren't necessarily absolute elements by which to judge a movie, Akeelah and the Bee is it.It's every bit as clich\u00e9d and predictable as you'd expect, but thanks to some fine performances, especially from the young leads, it is quite watchable.This is a film that couldn't be more predictable or more joyful. I just hope I haven't misspelled anything....a sporadically engaging drama.Fine performances all around and smart pacing that rivets us to the story.Any parents wondering why they don't make wholesome family flicks anymore can stop wondering.The best thing ... is that, unlike the majority of sports films, the film doesn't suggest that spelling has some kind of transcendental importance.It's hard to believe the best family film so far this year comes from a writer-director whose previous film bears the unfortunate title The Pornographer.It isn't just about the competition. It is about heart, dedication, intelligence and the pulling together of a entire community.Akeelah and the Bee is the kind of movie you want to recommend to every 11-year-old you know.An 11-year-old word wizard from the inner city longs for a little r-e-s-p-e-c-t, as Aretha Franklin sings in pop music's most famous spelling test. We know she'll get it; what's remarkable is that writer-director Doug Atchison earns our respect as well.It had the potential... to be great had it avoided running lockstep with the structure of lesser films.A feel-good movie that will bring you back to the days when you were excited about learning.There's just too much charm, too much heart, too much obvious sincerity and too much genuine quality to allow the film to be blown off.Atchinson has a winning touch with his young cast, but he gets stung by the ethnic stereotyping and the one-dimensional portrayals by his adult leads.What the movie gets exactly right is its knowledge that for some, realizing their first major accomplishment has nothing to do with throwing a touchdown or getting on base. For someone like Akeelah, correctly spelling a difficult world can prove the earlIt's the kind of assured work that should be a filmmaker's breakthrough, but is so good-natured it's at risk of going unrecognized.It won't happen but everyone should make a beeline to go see this movieHollywood has finally realized academic competitions can be just as dramatic as athletics.The message remains fantastic for kids, even if the director allows his events to teeter toward comical near the end.Joyfully uplifting, 'Akeelah and the Bee' is quietly, one of the year's finest.While some might spell 'predictable' as H-O-L-L-Y-W-O-O-D, this film manages to take that very quality and polish it off enough that the resultant offering feels fresh, engaging and highly entertaining.One could quibble about the need for another spelling bee film, but at least this one has some fine performances and a worthwhile message to recommend it.A film like this has to be seen. It's beautiful, it's encouraging, and it really inspires its audience to commit to something positive. Films such as this can not be merely forgotten.This is the kind of movie that audiences gather to their hearts (see Finding Neverland, Good Will Hunting, etc.), and it seems almost churlish to resist.Director Atchison succinctly separates the film's emotional core from a surfeit of cornball classism.Akeelah has lofty goals, and though it doesn't always achieve them, it is a rewarding tale for public educators, parents, and kids with big dreams.A lovely, touching story, Akeelah might be too pretty to be believable, but it's transporting nonetheless.I cannot find the words to express my joy and elation over this movie and my love for it. As ironic as that is, I'm speechless with happiness.Undermined by an over-scripted plot and gooey sentiment.Even though their movie is more like Akeelah and the B-Plus, Fishburne, Bassett and Palmer spell quality.... a film that makes studying Latin-root flash cards seem like a cool afterschool activity ...... a slight but winning heart-tugger ...It's a successful feel-good movie, but it would make you feel even better if it didn't push quite so hard for its desired effects.... this by turns funny, affecting tale pays homage not just to one young person's determination and character but to all those parents, teachers and myriad guardian angels who in real life instill young people with the love of language ...Sure it takes place in the geeky world of spelling bees, but Akeelah has the same old-fashioned, feel-good, against-the-odds qualities as Rocky.... a film that's very hard not to love.Here's a word for you. Can you spell p-r-e-d-i-c-t-a-b-l-e?An old-fashioned but thoroughly good-hearted tale of academics, achievement and uplift ...Where Spellbound generated crackling suspense in its competition climax, Akeelah is virtually suspense-free, even with an attempt to wring a twist on its pre-determined outcome.... a delight to sit through ...... it should fit quite snugly next to the inoffensive music CDs in the coffee chain's countertop racks.The movie is sweetly enjoyable, requiring only the ABCs of simple human identification.Without turning overtly preachy, Akeelah and the Bee puts forth a commendable message of the success that can follow hope and hard work.... an engaging story of a little girl who learns to dream big ...Akeelah isn't quite in the class of the movies that inspired it. But it captures the spirit of what made Spellbound so likeable ...Sentimental, manipulative, predictable and utterly charming, writer-director Doug Atchison's underdog tale revolves around an indifferent student who blossoms after heeding the siren call of competitive spelling.The latest spelling bee movie is a Starbucks Entertainment product, and it has a made-to-order feel about it, kind of like a compilation album.Keke Palmer, who's been working in television and movies for the past few years, is a natural on screen.It's the kind of movie parents will want their kids to see as opposed to much of what's playing at the multiplex.[P]retty darn wonderful: uplifting without being sappy, inspiring without being unrealistic. I confess I got a bit sniffly at the end, even though I saw the ending coming...Keke Palmer, Laurence Fishburne and Angela Bassett are absolutely fabulous in 'Akeelah and the Bee.' And so is this movie.Nice but more than a little formulaic...like a family telefilm that's migrated somewhat uncomfortably to theatres.Akeelah's predictable journey to success and self-actualization bounds with depth and heart.... a feel-good movie that also feels genuine, even when it's at its most rah-rah.If [director] Atchison's well-acted, good-intentioned crowd-pleaser can trick even one moviegoer into thinking that knowledge and spelling are somehow cool, then his film will be performing a societal good that offsets its slack reliance on formula.What sets the film apart is the manner in which it details how Akeelah's triumphs end up lifting the entire community.you'll still be cheering for Akeelah right up until the end of the film.Maybe it's complete hokum...but it's...perfectly executed, and it would take a harder heart than mine not be utterly engaged and moved by the result.Often tries too hard to tug at the heartstrings, but you'd have to be fairly cold and cynical not to give in.Great family films often entertain and inspire, but Akeelah and the Bee teaches useful words as well.Atchison's film relentlessly rams warm fuzzies down your throat and you know what? For all of the cliches and cringe-worthy dialogue, I found it nearly impossible to stay mad.... it's easy to overlook that contrivance, because the movie's heart is so clearly in the right place.An uplifting film about a ghetto child who makes good, but the script is marred by several extremely contrived and needlessly schmaltzy moments. ... Spellbound is so much better.E-x-h-i-l-i-r-a-t-o-r-y-; g-l-a-d-d-e-n-i-n-g; s-a-l-u-b-r-i-o-u-s. Spell it any way you want, this one's a keeper.Keke Palmer's performance delivers on the script's promise.\"Akeelah and the Bee\" is another contribution to the latest spate of dramatic adaptations of documentaries.Here's a story of courage, destiny, defying the odds, and, oh yes, a girl how can really spell.it's not only stupid, it's dim-witted, brainless and obtuse to the point of being insulting to the audience.There's never a moment when we're not certain everything will turn out OK. But to suggest a film bursting with such heart and good cheer should be any other way is a crime.Akeelah and the Bee may spell it out for you, but it pulls few punches in its depiction of the hurdles a verbally gifted South Central L.A. 11-year-old (Keke Palmer) must clear.A sentimental attempt to piggyback on the continued popularity of Spellbound.\"Akeelah And The Bee\" is a movie that parents should be happy to let their kids go see on their own; they just might start reading the dictionary.There's some welcome steel to the story that keeps it from being a fairy tale, but doesn't prevent it from being magicalAtchison puts his sappy and somewhat predictable script on Palmer's shoulders, and the result is phenomenal.Utilizes every clich\u00e9 in the book to hammer its point home with maximum sugar content.Beneath its sentimental exterior, this film is Foucauldian enough to take seriously the idea that knowledge is power.Tough love triumphs over adversity in this inspirational, feel-good film.Wonder no more about the validity of spelling bees. In this one, a child brings new life to the people surrounding her.Everybody has their moment.Writer-director Doug Atchison dishes out tough love with words like ratiocinate, synecdoche, and one that 'begins with an x' and only gets worse from there, but he pulls his punches when it comes to the more emotionally resonant issues faced by Akeelah.If Akeelah and the Bee is a generic, well-oiled commercial contraption, it is the first to credibly dramatize the plight of a truly gifted, poor black child.Right from the opening scene of this cuddly tale, you can sense every turning point, sentimental lesson and glimmer of hope coming a smile away.Akeelah and the Bee is not short on inspiration, emotion and uplift, but would go down better without all the refined sugar.Akeelah is derivatively entertaining in a feel-good sort of way.Akeelah musters up all the excitement it can about an underdog from the 'hood spelling impossibly difficult words. Formulaic, yes, but an admirable effort.Akeelah and the Bee carefully diagrams every cliche we've absorbed from sports movies, urban dramas, mentor flicks and precocious-children portraits. Yet it works.Producers, including Mark Cuban and Starbucks, should be commended for putting their money behind a film that, like Akeelah herself, dares to be different.It's the first movie in some time actually lives up to its family-friendly billing.The plot of Akeelah and the Bee may feel a trifle familiar, but here's the surprise: This is one time when familiarity doesn't breed contempt.Palmer soars, carrying writer/director Doug Atchison's film on new 'tween wings.Effectively anchoring the picture is Keke Palmer's lovely lead performance as Akeelah Anderson.Overly calculated yet undeniably potent.... makes a powerful impression.... Palmer -- and J.J. Villarreal, as her unflappable fellow contestant and first-blush romantic interest -- makes it all go down very easily.... it's never preachy.You expect nothing but emotional truth from Fishburne and Bassett, but it's young Palmer who wins your heart with a performance that's completely free of guile and affectation.Akeelah and the Bee won a screenplay contest a few years ago, and it reads as if its writer studied too many screenplays first.H-E-A-R-T-W-A-R-M-I-N-G ... I-N-S-P-I-R-A-T-I-O-N-A-L ... But there are also moments when this stand-up-and-cheer drama seems M-A-N-I-P-U-L-A-T-I-V-E and C-O-N-T-R-I-V-E-D.Akeelah and the Bee is so warm and well-meaning that you may find yourself wanting to like it more than you really do.... an underdog tale that manages to inspire without being sappy.Aleelah And The Bee does a good job of engaging the emotions.It is because Palmer's performance is so real and centred that we become so involved in Akeelah's quest.One of the best films of the year with its inspiring story of an eleven-year old African-American girl who claims her power with the help of 50,000 coaches.A winning and suitably uplifting way to spend a couple hours.The theme of educational growth against incredible odds is richly appreciated, but the payoffs lack dramatic gas.heartwarming feel good story about an underdog trying to overcome the odds and achieve fantastic victory, while also winning over an entire community inspired by her bravery. Yep, that sounds pretty good to me, too.It's the kind of warm-hearted surprise that transcends its trappings and winds up being more Bobby Fischer than Tyler Perry.A few silly quibbles aside, this is mainstream, family filmmaking at its finest.Keke Palmer has a studied air of concentration that keeps not just her character but the entire movie on track.The trouble comes in the form of repetitive saccharine that seeps through most of the more dramatic conversations, and especially through the extraordinarily cheesy soundtrackWe see the seeds of something special here; Palmer cements herself here as one to watch in the years to come.... a celebratory drama engineered to leave you choked up and cheering.While there's a temptation to dismiss Akeelah and the Bee as Good Will Spelling, there aren't enough (good) heartwarming films like this for either younger or older audiences.It's hard not to fall in love with the filmGive it an m, i, s, s.The film has an important, uplifting message; shame it couldn't be encased in a less faked-up story.The young star is such a little cutey-pie and the plot so cleverly manipulative that, whatever its faults, you'll still have a lump in your throat throughout.There's charm in this simple underdog tale, but clunky plotting and characterisation mean it has 'telemovie' written all over it. You'd be better off renting Spellbound instead.This isn't a patch on Spellbound ... but its strong performances and its skilful deployment of the finest, hand-picked cliches ensures that it remains enjoyable throughout.Its clich\u00e9s seem bigger and its characterisations broader than they would on the more forgiving telly.As much a fantasy as Lord of the Rings.However eager to entertain and even to model some ways of living life, the film doesn't wheedle us for our love or our devotion, and perhaps for that reason, it earns both.",
        "summary": "Although predictable in every way, a winning performance from its young star Keke Palmer and the rest of the cast makes it difficult not to cheer for the little heroine of Akeelah and the Bee. Sort of like Rocky for the middle school nerd set, Akeelah is a warm, family-friendly underdog story, featuring terrific supporting performances from Laurence Fishburne and Angela Bassett.",

        "document": "While not denying the moral issue of a director sleeping with a minor, Zenovich's riveting docu places the controversial case in a broader perspective that emphasizes the obsession with celebs, media circus, legal system and (mis)conduct of judges.Persuasively demonstrates Polanski was guilty as sin, yet his conviction was a miscarriage of justice.Zenovich's zeal exceeds her grasp.In contenting itself with the changing public perception of a long-misunderstood event, Wanted And Desired is compelling enough.There's much material here and it is brilliantly structured.In this documentary, the dwarf finally gets his due, fleshed out as a person rather than simply a media sensation.Seeks to explore both sides of the endless debate and asks all parties to consider every angle before labeling him as a pedophile or misunderstood genius...Its indictment ultimately feels like a secondary issue to Polanski's apparently incontrovertible guilt, which makes him--in this instance--still more victimizer than victim.a great and somewhat Kafkaesque story that Polanski might have enjoyed directing... had it been fiction.Roman Polanski deserves his badge of dishonor, no question about it. This amazing documentary argues that others need to start sporting one as well.Meticulously crafted and keenly thought out, the film also serves as a useful historical document. It illuminates its time period, delves into moral hypocrisy and shows the evolution of muck-raking celebrity journalism.Though Marina Zenovich's film deals with the notorious case of the film director who pleaded guilty to having sex with a 13-year-old, the film's real subject is the California legal system turned upside down by celebrity and media pressure.It's the sort of complex story Polanski himself would have excelled at telling, if he weren't busy living it.Marina Zenovich's documentary is that it fills in a lot of crucial details (including a few new ones), primarily about the rape and its aftermath.Roman Polanski (The Pianist, Rosemary's Baby, Chinatown) is unquestionably a great filmmaker, but as Marina Zenovich's documentary Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired perhaps unintentionally demonstrates, he's also a creep.I found myself occasionally enthralled, mainly due to Polanski's haunted presence coming through, even in the form of an absent ghost.Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired, a documentary by Marina Zenovich that is also a first-rate work of reportage, makes a forceful case that the whole truth of the matter was never heard in court and Polanski was more sinned against than sinning.With a subject like Roman Polanski, you don't really need to do much to capture audience interest. But maybe that's the reason Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired doesn't live up to its promise.She has achieved extraordinary access to the other still-living players in the case, and they all seem to be in agreement: Polanski is correct in saying the judge played with him as a cat might play with a mouse.Whether you can swallow that or not, the mesmerizing narrative recounts a media circus of unrivaled malignance.This chronicle of Polanski's life, career and legal woes offers an engaging portrait of the artist.What makes Wanted and Desired riveting is that Zenovich balances this immorality play by interviewing nearly everyone involved and mixes it with perfectly culled archival footage.Mesmo tendo criado uma narrativa envolvente, coesa e impec\u00e1vel a ponto de servir como base para os advogados de Polanski solicitarem o arquivamento do caso, este document\u00e1rio foi ignorado pela Academia. Arre.an essential entry in Hollywood's cultural chronicleWhile not apologising for his disgusting behaviour, the film puts Polanski's actions in the context of a turbulent life.A judiciously argued account with intriguing asidesThe film's verdict is that Polanski is too distinguished to persecute by placing him in a prison among, well, criminals. Wanted And Desired: A premeditated act of propaganda in the service of exoneration with a creative genius defense, instead of remorse.\"Zenovich's film is a fair and skillful chronicling of the Roman Polanski case, and a study of how the circumstances of celebrity influence the carrying out of justice in the U.S. It's not an in-depth study of the filmmaker's psychology nor of how his lifSome might confuse Zenovich's indictment on the judge as a cop-out in judging Polanski. But the facts remain. There's no further insight into the heinous crime. Nor is there a new judgment to be passed on the man who committed it. Anyone looking for new rIf you're not a diehard fan of Polanski I can't see the pic holding your attention, as it lacks intrigue.None of the interviewees in Marina Zenovich's fascinating documentary manages to make sense of the famous filmmaker's behavior or apparent thinking. But they all have compelling impressions.An exhaustive and riveting narrativeUsing tons of footage and new interviews with the victim and key legal figures -- but not the subject himself -- director Marina Zenovich shows how Polanski's darker urges were matched on a moral level by others involved in the case.Zenovich has made a feature worthy of its eccentric and reckless central figure at his most cynical and embittered.A clever, contemplative kind of courtroom drama that utilizes the best of Hollywood filmmaking style to tell a story so strange, it must be true.This is more about the culture of celebrity, the sensationalism, a power hungry, media-hungry judge, and all the things that have happened since then. And as such, it's a very good documentary.The film leans a bit too heavily on the idea that Polanski was a high-living artist who was rejected by a puritanical America and embraced by an understanding Europe, but on balance, the film is a credible re-evaluation of a complex man.As an anatomy not only of Polanski's psyche but also of the legal system he confronted, it's as baroquely compelling as The Dark Knight.The film walks a fine line between contempt for Polanski's crimes and sympathy for his trials and his screwed-up psyche, and it manages both...This is a superb picture, sharp, open-minded, wised-up and cinematically accomplished. I wonder if any man could've handled the Polanski enigma with the same ironic intelligence [Marina] Zenovich has.Is Polanski a great filmmaker who made a mistake, or a perverted coward who ran from the law instead of facing the music?As HBO's spellbinding documentary, Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired reveals, the immediate facts can't begin to describe the moral ambiguities churning beneath the surface of Polanski's tale.This deft and subtle film is a fitting tribute to a man -- like him or not -- whose life deserves more than tabloid headlines.What's most interesting is the correlations drawn between the diminutive director and the infamous judge who presided over the case like an auteur of the courtroomA subtly intelligent and sharply argued documentary.",

Heart of the Game asks very little of its audience. And it delivers in kind.You don't have to be a basketball player or fan to enjoy this movie. Documentary film-making at its zenith, this takes you on a magic carpet ride.The upbeat film touches on serious issues without becoming lugubrious.... falls in the tradition of the best sports films and is well worth seeing.The film is a furious full-court press, its subjects aflame with the kind of passion only youth can furnish. Even their bruises are luminous.The Heart of the Game is a sweet, engaging journey with the Roosevelt Roughriders, whose kindly coach encourages the girls to snarl like wolves and devour like lions.Given so many narrative strands%u2014Resler's peculiar coaching philosophies, the drawn-out eligibility battle, Russell's problems coping with school and personal demons, and the team's annual push for the state championship%u2014director Ward Serrill cho[An] inspirational tale, which values team spirit even as it celebrates the will of two talented individuals.Heart of the Game scores some telling points while tweaking gender stereotypes, playfully provoking thought while seriously suggesting that dunking and dribbling can be important steps toward self-empowerment.'She Got Game' in a wolf pack attack of high school hoops that's tough love from beginning to end.The hoop dreams of the teenage girls in the documentary The Heart of the Game are fairly straightforward if a wee bit intense.Genuinely touching and unquestionably sincere, the movie certainly has heart -- but it could have used a little more game.Yet another inspirational documentary that serves up the sort of dynamic characters and genuine intrigue that most of its fictional counterparts would kill for.the real star of the show is Resler himself -- a sports fanatic whose commitment to the game he loves changes the lives of the girls who play for him.While this isn't a great documentary (see Hoop Dreams), it's a likable one...an inner-city, gender-reversal version of Hoosiers.Suffice it to say that an entire team of Hollywood scriptwriters couldn't have come up with a better ending.Genuinely inspiring and free of the drippy platitudes found in most sports-themed films, The Heart of the Game is an exhilarating triumph.As far as magnetic team leaders go, it's hard to imagine a Hollywood screenwriter dreaming up a character as colorful as the coach in the basketball documentary, The Heart of the Game.If you don't cheer for the high school girls basketball team in the bright documentary The Heart of the Game, you probably slash Mom's tires every Mother's Day.This is one of the best docs of this sort I've seen since \"Murderball,\"If you are a sports fan, a docu buff or just like a good, inspirational movie, then this is one for you.Too much game, not enough heart.If you or any kid over the age of 10 has even a half-interest in the definition of the word 'teamwork,' as well as the words 'real-life suspense,' this is the movie.Heart of the Game does contain a powerful human story, but we are forced to watch it from a distance. Serrill never penetrates its fringes.There's no denying the exuberant energy and emotional force of this movie. It gets to you.Serrill's documentary on a girls' high school basketball team in Seattle has oodles of heart. What it hasn't got is game.The dramas going on here, on and off the court, more than make up for any lack of flash.It's a lively, inspirational achievement that will put a lump in your throat.Combines nonstop action with an absorbing story to become a classic on par with Hoosiers and Hoop Dreams -- with the best of He Got Game and Glory Road thrown in for good measure....director Ward Serrill finds a myth-ready figure in Bill Resler, the college tax professor who takes over the Roosevelt High School varsity team and uses a combination of crazed passion for the sport and a laid-back personal approach toward the playersIt emerges as a captivating and classic sports film. It is also a compelling story about fairness and doing the right thing, from the team level on up to state bureaucracies and the judicial system.As Coach Resler tells us early in the film, he is one of the few people privileged to know Darnellia Russell. This is your chance to know her, as well.'There is nothing more fun than watching you guys play basketball,' says Resler, at one point, and the great strength of The Heart of the Game is that you can't help but agree.An Oscar-level piece of work.It's an incredibly stirring documentary, one which will have you snarling and cheering at the same time.By [the end] we have come to have real respect for Russell's determination.It's a wrenching, ennobling essay on teamwork and the hard struggle to change one's life.The director frequently got distracted, to the detriment of the film, but the end result is an interesting documentary that is as unpolished and gutsy as the championship-caliber high school hoop stars at the other end of his camera.Hoop Dreams got remarkably up close and personal with the players and their families; Heart never really gets past Darnellia's shy facade.You'll be smiling and happy as you leave the The Heart of the Game, with a newfound respect for girls' basketball and those who play it.An exhilarating story of loyalty and perseverance, The Heart of the Game succeeds as both inspiration and social commentary.It dribbles more often than it scores.The film is a mildly interesting work that, with judicious pruning, could have been so much more.Serrill couldn't have asked for a better script. For a documentary, \"The Heart of the Game\" is high drama indeed. Wonderful.Most certainly, it will make you root for the Roughriders on and off the court.A funny, charming, subtly touching documentary that captures the passion and excitement that can be involved in even the most minor league of amateur sports.One of the best documentaries I've seen this year.The pat inspirational formula is followed to a sweaty T, although it comes here with an inadvertent side effect -- more than a few nagging questions never get answered.It is fun to watch, stimulating to experience and something you want to share with friends.Serrill, making his feature debut after numerous short promotional films, takes a story that is seemingly about one thing, and uses it to gently explore the bigger ideas of gender, race, class, cooperation, competition and what winning really means.It's almost impossible to refrain from cheering as if you were right there in the stands.Serrill's disciplined, beautifully constructed film is so propulsive, so spiritually triumphant, it's absolutely one of the best sports docs ever.Its squeak-and-sweat athleticism, its tough, bruised, big-hearted players and its electrifying championship countdowns should appeal to anyone who loves the game.Anybody who doesn't find themselves on the edge of their seat for this film's final minutes shouldn't be going to movies.[The Roughriders] persevere, as did director Serrill, who took his time to find the real heart of this game.The Heart of the Game is gripping entertainment with a positive message, but it's hard to escape the feeling that there's more to this story than Serrill is able or willing to tell us.Serrill, making his feature debut, didn't plan on spending seven years with the Roughriders. But reality just kept getting more compelling and complicated, and his persistence paid off.Not a sports documentary but a being-human documentary.This is a movie about empowerment, integrity and having fun, and those are always in season.A true sports lover's delight.The intrusive narration, from hip hopper Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges, offers little sense of real lives unfolding, more of a way being paved to an, admittedly tense, all-American triumph-over-adversity climax.It doesn't seem appropriate to call it luck, but somehow Mr. Serrill ends up with a story that would make any Hollywood sports movie proud.Serrill does a good job of grounding the film with the conventions to suck you in and make the team likeable. But then the politics and real stories emerge, which makes the film truly stand apart from the crowd.[The film] covers seven years and touches on some of the same social issues that gave Hoop Dreams its epic sweep, yet Serrill fails to treat any of them adequately, and the narrative loses its shape as events unfold.Might best be thought of as a female version Hoop Dreams.Writer/director Ward Serrill's wonderful documentary, about a Seattle high school girls basketball team the Roughriders coached by the inspiring Bill Resler, is a \"Hoop Dreams\" of the early 21st century.Girls have hoop dreams too. And dreams can come true at the final buzzer.So many astonishing and inspirational events take place that if The Heart Of The Game wasn't such a great documentary, it could have and should have been a box office hit drama.A nice little documentary that proves that nice guys, and nice girls, don't always finish last.The film leaves screenwriting duties to the wildest and most creative of the lot: Fate and Chance.Occasionally thrilling, often challenging and consistently engaging ...Few athletic films, factual or dramatized, have given so keen a sense of how a team builds and changes, and how acutely the grind and elation of a fast, complex sport can shape character and lives.The girls' theatrical ferocity, relative innocence and youthful earnestness is almost heartbreaking.An exhausting and thoroughly entertaining tale of race, fair play, loyalty, pregnancy and the true spirit of amateur athletics.Sketchy as it can be at times, The Heart of the Game keeps us involved.Serrill is ... able to generate some genuine suspense, and the ensuing human drama -- most of it swirling around Russell, one of the few black students at the mostly white school -- is fascinating.How does a first-time filmmaker put together a documentary as compelling and dramatic as this is?Darnellia is an inspiring and engaging heroine, and her story speaks volumes about the marginalization of women's athletics.Serrill touches on important issues ... but what his movie does best is capture the thrill of high-school sports and the offbeat personalities within the game.gives a gentle, understated understanding to rural and suburban life in Seattle and to the gameIt's uplifting and inspiring to see a coach who brings out the best in his girls. Like the documentary Hoop Dreams, this turns out to be a whole lot more than just a movie about basketball.Uses its copious basketball footage and revealing player interviews to deftly chart Darnellia's trials and tribulations as well as the squad's eventual embrace of a selfless, teamwork-first ethos.If a late-middle-age tax professor can coach a girls' basketball team, there is hope for all of us.A filmmaker of great patience, Serrill chronicled Resler's teams for several years, demonstrating that if one sticks to a subject long enough, powerful things will emerge.An astounding drama that spans seven years, wrestling with issues of race, gender and class while capturing the struggles of competition with intelligence and intimacy.Who needs faux melodramatic school sports stories when a real-life documentary like Heart of the Game shows it in living, breathing heart-wrenching color?Emotional, uplifting, vexing and infuriating, it's the first basketball documentary worthy of being compared to 1994's Hoop Dreams....a compelling and insightful glimpse into the convergence of perpetual teenage issues with modern high school athletics, with the entertainment value extending far beyond basketball fans.The result is nothin' but net.It shifts focus too often to hang together as an in-depth portrait of either the unconventional coach or his headstrong star player.A female version of Hoop Dreams.Boredom and irritation set in early with this shallow, parochial and blandly celebratory documentary about a US high-school girls' basketball team, of frankly limited interest to non-US audiences.It's packed with left-field twists and turns and culminates in a genuinely nail-biting match where old rivalries come to a head. In the end, it's all you can do not to stand up and cheer.",

        "document": "The ex-lovers' new conversation is stimulating and banal, selfish and broad-minded, affectionate and recriminatory, insightful and obtuse -- in short, the kind of dialogue two people might have while pouring out their hearts and poring over their pasts.A richer experience than the original.Surprisingly too linear for its own good...You can't get much more minimalist than this sequel, which could be called My Coffee With Celine.A worthy sequel to Before Sunrise, this is a thoroughly engaging, well written film with perfect performances from Hawke and Delpy.While it's not necessary to see Before Sunrise again, it's essential that you have seen it. [Get] the original, and then go see one of the best movies of the year...What great chemistry! Again.For the movie's placid external nature hides a tumultuous emotional underside filled with recriminations, anger, hope, compassion and love.Before Sunrise and Before Sunset are a rare case of two movies that rightfully demand yet another sequel.Mr. Linklater and his two creative leads have managed a miraculous transformation of the characters from once-callow lovers into grown-ups teetering on the edge of eternity.Jesse and Celine seem like real people, complete with flaws and weaknesses. That they become so fleshed out in such a brief running time is a testament to the script and Hawke and Delpy's acting abilities.Somehow, improbably, Linklater has now made two of the most romantic films of the last decade, both featuring the same characters.This is more about an exchange of information than an exchange of ideas, but the results still captivate.Before Sunset has an immediacy that makes other movies feel comatose.There's enough here that a thirtysomething audience, mindful of the complexity of their lives and their own missed opportunities, might respond to. But there isn't much magic.A rare example of a sequel that is labor of love -- not one that worships at the altar of the Almighty Dollar.Before Sunset is that rare sequel, delicately complicating the original, while also creating its own elegant sense of anticipation.Although a sequel may not have been entirely necessary, Before Sunset does provide some closure...You have to be a romantic to love these movies, and I fell for them hook, line and sinker.Before Sunset has an easy, unforced air about it, mostly because of what seems to be a real rapport between the two lead actors.The incessant jawboning of Before Sunset is all foreplay and no climax.A lot of the prattle seems like the same-old half-absorbed guff that passes for profundity in so much of Linklater's work.For all the talk, there's always something unspoken bubbling away in the space between these two ex-lovers...A deep investigation of attraction is what made \"Sunrise\" so special. In Sunset, it's the profound, frustrating feelings of regret and anger over missed opportunities, which makes this drama ready to boil over at any moment.an immensely satisfying sequel that carefully treads the line between the comic and the tragic while detailing the pros and cons of maturity.Linklater's method, in an age when critics celebrate the egomania of M. Night Shyamalan and Quentin Tarantino, distinguishes him as Gen X's most literary director.Through the verbiage and the dubious equation of realism with truth, Before Sunset instills profundity -- maintaining an optimism and sobriety about life after 30.A late date movie that gives young love a good name. More sequels, please.This is simply a wonderful piece of film-making.Linklater gives his characters something we rarely get in real life: an opportunity to resolve the sense of loss and regret created by a blown chance at love and happiness.Before Sunset may be the most unusual sequel this summer, but it's certainly the sweetest and one of the best.Exceptionally smart and tenderly romantic.One of the neat things about Before Sunset is that Delpy, like her character in these movies, dropped off the radar after Sunrise. Seeing her again is like seeing her through Hawke's eyes.The film ultimately depicts thirtysomething melancholy just as effectively as its predecessor portrayed Gen-X romanticism.It tells of a love affair so heady it generates goose bumps, yet the story unfolds with such unfailing honesty that its characters become people we know, their actions and words a reflection of our own experiences.It eats at you, just like renewed love.This sweet film is a genuine treat, even if there's little plot, no antic mayhem and its 90-minute running time is mostly consumed by nonstop, sometimes pretentious dialogue as Celine and Jesse meander together through pretty Paris neighborhoods.As drama, it doesn't hold up, and the screenplay's so loosely structured it almost seems improvised, but the affection that Linklater has for Jesse and Celine is so palpable that the movie coasts by on charm.It has earthy (and therefore sexy) urban locations, a splendid originality of voice, a loose and distinctive visual style, and it sends audiences out humming with the realness and beauty of it all. ... But it should have been twice as long.The naturalistic dialogue is a masterful bit of writing.Hawke and Delpy are splendid. They love these characters, and why not? They wrote them.I'm not sure if it's the actors or their conversation that makes the film appealing, maybe both, but it works in a sweet, thought-provoking way.Una pel\u00edcula sobre la frustraci\u00f3n de crecer, sobre la constataci\u00f3n de que la felicidad es un concepto extra\u0144o que se disfruta mucho m\u00e1s como posibilidad que como meta.[A]n experiment can be valuable without being successful.Of course I liked it a lot, I almost loved it. I mean, I often felt like I loved it, but I'm not sure I really did or I'm not sure why. It's, like, a hard movie to argue with.O resultado \u00e9 que este \u00e9, ao lado de Brilho Eterno de uma Mente Sem Lembran\u00e7as, um dos melhores filmes do ano. E, tamb\u00e9m como aquele, um dos mais rom\u00e2nticos.[a] charming, intelligent romanceHere's an unusual sequel to an equally unusual film from nine years ago.If you enjoy intelligent dialogue and believe in love, then you'll enjoy this film.morally ambivalent about the importance of the family unit and personal responsibility...uninvolving dialogue, uninspired directing, deficient acting.Una experiencia de vida inigualable, una historia enriquecedora, un final inolvidable y perfecto. Magistral, una obra maestra.There is something uniquely unforgettable in the way Linklater, Hawke and Delpy (equal collaborators on the script) find nuance, art and eroticism in words, spoken and unspoken.A love story for the adult who dares to dream.Features beguiling performances and a heart that most anyone can relate to.The beauty and grace of Before Sunset is its unparalleled ability to capture the idiosyncratic rhythm and cadence of everyday dialogue.It may be a non-stop talkathon but, at least this time around, he's not so obsessed about making his plane.Linklater does an admirable job of keeping things flowing by having his protagonists walk through picture-postcard streets and hop on a boat taxi for some lovely moving travelogue shots to hold interest.A hugely successful experiment to see if a movie can captivate an audience with a conversation between two people in real time.The splendid sequel to an overlooked gem.The dialogue captivates without ever feeling forced or cinematic...Linklater, Delpy and Hawke have sustained a flawless performance -- one that's warm, thoughtful, funny, sexy, charming and in all ways alive.However, between Delpy, Hawke, and Linklater, a script was born and once again the couple meets, this time in Paris, this time for far fewer hours (and in real time).At the risk of overhyping 80 minutes of intimate real-time, this is the soul of generosity, a beautifully vibrant and big-spirited film.I was charmed, engaged and moved by the delightful Before Sunset, and without having re-seen the earlier picture, it has been upgraded in my mind in the light of the new one.A gemlike minimalist triumph -- deeper and more provocative than its predecessor.Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy have reconvened to bring us this belated, yet very welcome sequel.Before Sunset retains most of what was engaging about the first movie: it has its gentleness, its romanticism and, most importantly, its idealism. What it has lost is the sense of mystery.The characters eventually manage to get beyond their existential ennui and incessant talking to something approaching romance.The final 25 minutes of Before Sunset, starting with excruciatingly honest admissions from both parties in a car backseat, are the best filmmaking I've ever seen.Being able to have such a lengthy conversation without edits or a change in camera angles makes the performance by these two actors that much more impressive.That Before Sunset complements and in many ways surpasses its predecessor is but one of the great accomplishments of this wonderful film.Having seen Before Sunset twice, and Before Sunrise again in between, I can't say which film is better. Both seem to fulfill an ambition Jean-Luc Godard expressed in the 60s -- to achieve 'the definitive by chance.'Before Sunrise captures the exhilaration of connecting with another person; Before Sunset moves forward from there, burrowing into territory that's more complex and dangerous, but also perhaps more vital.Jesse and Celine are perfectly likable, sympathetic people, and seeing them begin to fall in love ... is a reasonably satisfying experience.The result is a complicated and thrilling game that, unlike some diversions we have had lately, does not debase the words \"romantic\" and \"comedy.\"One of the season's must-see efforts. All of the studio-produced, mass-marketed romances out there, take note: this is precisely what a love story should be.Captures the reality of two people falling in love in a way no vacuous, titanium-clad, polished-to-within- an-inch-of-its-life Hollywood romance can.an 80-minute conversation with a freshness, a surprising urgency, and two characters full of desire, faults, and - still - hope.Linklater has done a brilliant job at keeping it all contained.How often does a visual medium make such an elegant argument about the beauty of language, even as it asserts its right to tell a story and move us with its vision?For all its modesty, lingers in the mind like an unresolved relationship or a life-altering, if random, moment.A fictional romance with a factual feel, a near-documentary quality that makes it difficult to distinguish the actor from the role.For my money, Sunset tops the first installment because it involves characters who have more life under their belts. Nothing like a few years to clarify a personality.Richard Linklater's Before Sunrise gets a sweet, sad and touching sequel after almost a decade.Romantic sequel hangs together for 80 minutes, and not just 3 minutes at a timeMay be the best movie of the summer.If you didn't like Before Sunrise, filmmaker Richard Linklater says, you'll hate Before Sunset. But if you treasured the original, you're sure to prize the 'romance for realists' sequel.A small masterpiece.A savvy sequel that should speak to anyone who's let that one great love slip away.Emotionally, it's a high-wire act as dazzling as any of the CGI effects that pack all those big budget blockbusters.The apparent slightness of the picture is deceptive...it has surprising depth, and it's definitely worth a trip to the theatre to get reacquainted with Jesse and Celine.A modest masterpiece of modern romantic temperament and trepidation.Before Sunset is one of the best romantic dramas of the year with a very intelligent and seductive performance by Julie Delpy.In its own small way, 'Before Sunset' is a perfect film...there is not a single scene in this film that I would want to change or alter in any way.We get completely self-absorbed discussions from a couple of frickin' actors.Hawke's ruefulness seems more than earned here (and, thus, genuine); Delpy's callow winsomeness has ripened to a ruddy sheen.Jesse and Celine come to life again in ways that are sad and beautiful, funny and profound.What ultimately makes Before Sunset so special (and maybe the most resonant, least self-conscious 'great movie romance' of its era) is its deep-rooted honesty -- the way it takes the bitter with the sweet and somehow leaves us feeling elated.A film of luminous delights.A simply amazing film -- touching, sexy, smart, sad and, beyond all, passionate about the value of time and love.Its perfection can be summed up in one line: 'I like that. It's more real.'Says more about the mystery of love and attachment than any overblown Hollywood romance that comes to mind.You don't need to have seen Before Sunrise to appreciate Before Sunset, but as a one-two cinematic punch on the subjects of love and aging these films have few equals.Consists of a conversation, albeit a complex one that covers work, romantic love, sex, yearning, memory, commitment, compromise, coincidence, disappointment, passion, men, women, the passage of time and songwriting.Hawke and Delpy are credited with writing some of the dialogue, presumably as improvisations. They manage to be both natural and intense, and their characters feel real, even if the situation does not.This real-time reunion is entertaining, engaging and strongly emotional.Some laughs, some tears, a wonderful song and an absolutely perfect ending.Allows you to watch two deeply engaged and engaging performers moving verbally through delicately negotiated layers of delight, apprehension, desire and surrender.By the end, you are either in love again or you never were.[R]eally top notch work here.Thanks to the actors' chemistry and Paris, Before Sunset has an irresistible pull.There is no way for Jesse and Celine to ever recreate their Vienna fling. The real question is whether they should bother trying.I seriously doubt that anything left on 2004's roster can compete with this remarkable new masterpiece from Richard Linklater. It's easily the film of the year.Forget Spider-Man's tussle with Doc Ock. Forget Shrek's trek to Far Far Away. And forget Harry Potter's latest attempt to endure the snipes of Snape. For me, the sequel to see during the summer of 2004 is Richard Linklater's Before Sunset.A deeper, darker, altogether more memorable experience. It doesn't extend the characters so much as fulfill them.An unabashedly romantic film with an ending so perfect it took my breath away.All one could wish for in a sequel -- it enriches, glosses, and completes the original.This movie is basically a yakfest, but an incredibly fluid and involving one . . .Hawke is irritating, but the picture does exude romance.Well acted, very well written, well told, and bears yet another ending that will keep audiences wondering.Linklater, Hawke and Delpy have collaborated on the script, resulting in an enthralling snapshot of life from the point of view of two like souls who spark by just being in each other's presence.Shooting in long takes, Linklater and his actors (who get co-screenwriting credit) allow the conversation to curlicue effortlessly from literate banter to matters of the heart, and sometimes to places in between.Charming, talky romance for older teens and adults.As a romance streaked with regrets, obligations and fears, \"Sunset\" builds to a wistful, perfect conclusion - a fadeout infused with the idea that a memory's never finished as long as you're alive and one of the loveliest last-line exchanges of all time.the film takes a miraculous healing turn at the end, and the characters rise above their ruefulness, and use it as a springboard into hope...a superior sequel that accomplishes everything that one might've hoped...A stone-cold masterpiece.It's a lovely, beguiling little film a rare treat during this overheated season of blockbusters. It's also an unusual example of a follow-up that doesn't seem forced, but expands effortlessly on the original.The reunion has some lively moments, but a great deal of slow walking and fatuous talking about love, married life and sex.A fluid, engaging, charming, frustrating, funny, and lively movie.A verbose, invigorating gem. There hasn't been a brighter, better, more spry and alive relationship picture in years.The chemistry between Jesse and Celine --- and Hawke and Delpy and, for that matter, Linklater --- is as immediate as it is appealing.A jaw-droppingly beautiful and moving film, as defining a moment for its generation as its predecessor.This 80-minute reverie unfolds like a piece of emotional origami into a seductive, playful and engaging bit of conversational foreplay.The best movie of the year so far.Thanks to fine writing and two very good actors, filmgoers get another insightful look at the nature of love. Paris, also, has seldom looked so fresh and beautiful on screen.I found myself hoping that Linklater, Hawke and Delpy would revisit these characters in another 10 years. And perhaps again in 20 years.Films about romantic relationships don't get any better than Richard Linklater's Before Sunset.Elegant, engaging and much-appreciated follow-up to the original film.Before Sunset is a quiet, introspective little film that reverberates with more emotion and more human realness than any CGI enhanced cinematic event could ever hope to.Before Sunset is all talk, and audiences will be listening intently to every word of this smart romance[P]erfectly perfect... so charmingly simple a film, so absorbing and ambitious in its simplicity. I love, love, love this movie.Frankly, I wanted to stand up, shout \"Get a room\" at the two characters, and do something more interesting... like watching paint peel.There's not much on the surface, for sure, but its undertow is seductive and ferocious.For a film that's all talk and no action, it's a pretty romantic love story.[Linklater's] best, most mature work to date and perhaps the most daringly subtle film of the year.It quickly becomes a bore, full of feel-good nonsense and half-baked philosophies from Delpy and Hawke's self-important syllogisms.It's a movie to cheer lovers and movie lovers alike -- an enchanting midsummer cocktail for two, served at dusk on the banks of the Seine.Before Sunset is better, perhaps because the characters are older and wiser, perhaps because they have more to lose (or win), and perhaps because Hawke and Delpy wrote the dialogue themselves.Even if you haven't seen the original, Before Sunset engrosses you, as Hawke and Delpy pull you into the lives of Jesse and Celine merely with the power of their words.This is a wonderful movie.An intelligent, engagingly honest study of love lost and, just maybe, regained.A great character study that I hope to see continued in another decade or so, with real conversations, true feelings and romance throughout.This lovely film does an exemplary job of conveying the manner in which the freedom and naivety of youth inevitably fall by the wayside, leaving only cherished memories.Enthralling and moving.While the movie appears to be a simple romantic drama, filmmaker Richard Linklater uses those trappings to explore some weightier topics -- in this case, ruminations on the meaning of destiny, especially when it comes to romantic relationships.What is to all intents and purposes 80 minutes worth of stolen moments, turns out to be one of the most rewarding films of the yearThe sequel no one needed is a surprise pleasure: witty, heartfelt, and true.A vibrant emotional epic.The experiences they talk about are like so many sound-bites; they haven't internalized the wisdom that the words suggest.Proves itself well worth the nine-year wait, and for a sequel so squarely rooted in the first film, it stands lightly on its own two feet.Though it is sometimes maddening, the movie's prodigious verbiage is also enthralling, precisely because of its casual disregard for the usual imperatives of screenwriting.All told, [Linklater is] one of today's most versatile American filmmakers, and Before Sunset finds his light shining as brightly as ever.The one thing I hope for after seeing \"Before Sunset\" is that Linklater and his stars will visit us again in eight or 10 years timeOne of the most amazing aspects of \"Before Sunset\" is how conversation alone is made so suspenseful. If this movie were a book it would be described as a page-turner.The bad news is that Before Sunset is not as delirious an experience as its predecessor. The good news is that it's wonderful anyway, and in ways that tell us something about our romance with Before Sunrise.A film that in its joy, optimism and aesthetic achievement keeps faith with American cinema at its finest.Romantic, real and as generous as it is vulnerable, the art of conversation has rarely been so acute, honest and revealing.Deft at exposing the cracks in the psychological foundations we build for ourselves as we approach middle age.",
