NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While those state races remain too close to call, Republicans are expected to wrest the North Carolina governorship from Democratic control, and to easily win GOP-held seats in Utah, North Dakota and Indiana.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Holding Sway On Health Care NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While the occupant of the governor's office is historically far less important than the party that controls the state legislature, top state officials in coming years are expected to wield significant influence in at least one major area.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The seat is expected to be won by McCrory, a former Charlotte mayor, who is facing Perdue's lieutenant governor, Walter Dalton. McCrory lost a close race to Perdue in 2008, when then-presidential candidate Barack Obama became the first Democrat to win North Carolina in more than three decades.

        "summary": "\u2013 It's a race for the governor's mansion in 11 states today, and the GOP could end the night at the helm of more than two-thirds of the 50 states. The GOP currently controls 29 of the country's top state offices; it's expected to keep the three Republican ones that are up for grabs (Utah, North Dakota, and Indiana), and wrest North Carolina from the Dems. That brings its toll to 30, with the potential to take three more, reports NPR. Races in Montana, New Hampshire, and Washington are still too close to call, and in all three, Democrat incumbents aren't seeking reelection. The results could have a big impact on health care, since a Supreme Court ruling grants states the ability to opt out of ObamaCare's Medicaid expansion. \"A Romney victory would dramatically empower Republican governors,\" said one analyst.

        "document": "NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR UPDATE: 4/19/2001 Read Richard Metzger: How I, a married, middle-aged man, became an accidental spokesperson for gay rights overnight on Boing Boing NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It\u2019s time to clarify a few details about the controversial \u201cHey Facebook what\u2019s SO wrong with a pic of two men kissing?\u201d story, as it now beginning to be reported in the mainstream media, and not always correctly. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR First of all, with regards to the picture: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The photo which was used to illustrate my first post about the John Snow Kiss-In is a promotional still from the British soap opera \u201cEastenders.\u201d It features one of the main characters from the show (Christian Clarke, played by the actor John Partridge- left) and someone else who I don\u2019t know. I am not a regular viewer so I can\u2019t say if the man on the right is an extra or an actual character. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This picture has itself caused scandal in the UK, as it was a gay kiss that was broadcast before the watershed, and as such led to a number of complaints to the BBC. However, since this episode aired (October 2008) Christian now has a boyfriend and a few more gay kisses have taken place. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In relation to the John Snow Kiss-In event, I used this particular photo because I considered it to be quite mild (no groping, no tongues). The photos I had considered using before I chose that one are much more racy. Oh the irony! NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Secondly, the removal of the Facebook John Snow Kiss-In event: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It turns out that the Facebook event for the John Snow Kiss-In was not blocked by Facebook, but made private by the creator of the event itself. Paul Shetler, the organizer, left this comment on the previous thread: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cHey I just saw this. Before it goes too far, I just want people to know that FB have NOT removed the kiss-in event page; it\u2019s still there, but _I made the event private after the event_ was over and only visible to those who had been invited as there were starting to be trolls posting abusive nonsense on it.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Thanks for clearing that up, Paul. Now if Facebook will only reply to Richard\u2019s query about why they removed my original post and photo when he put it up on his wall\u2026 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It has been erroneously reported in the media that our own Richard Metzger (who lives in Los Angeles) organized the London \u201cKiss-In\u201d event, which is untrue, and also unfair to Paul Shetler and the actual organizers. Also, Richard did not state in his post that Facebook HAD taken the event page down, he just questioned IF this was the case and IF there was a connection with MY post about the event being removed from his own wall. This seems to have confused some people. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Here is a report on the John Snow Kiss-In from the Guardian, featuring an interview with Mr Shetler: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ||||| || News || NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Page 1 of 1 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR UPDATED: A photo of two men kissing that was posted on a Facebook page protesting a London pub\u2019s decision to eject a same-sex couple for kissing has been removed by the social networking site, an error, according to a rep for the company. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The photo in question does not violate our Statement of Rights and Responsibilities and was removed in error,\" the statement, obtained by America Blog, says. We apologize for the inconvenience\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Dangerous Minds Facebook page was set up to promote a \u201cgay kiss-in\u201d demonstration in London to protest the pub. The page used a photo of two men kissing to promote the event. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to NYULocal.com, the photo was quickly removed and the following e-mail was sent to administrators of the Facebook page: \u201cShares that contain nudity, or any kind of graphic or sexually suggestive content, are not permitted on Facebook.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The decision to remove the photo has prompted scores of people to post their own pictures of same-sex couples kissing in protest \u2014 dozens in the last few hours alone.\n",
        "summary": "\u2013 It turns out Facebook is only guilty of about half of what it\u2019s been accused of in the gay kiss incident.

But Facebook did not, as has been reported in several places, take down the kiss-in event itself. Here\u2019s what happened: The photo Facebook took down was posted by the Dangerous Minds blog to promote the event. In its initial write-up about the incident, the blog observed that the page organizing the protest had been taken down. But it was actually the organizer himself who \"removed\" the event, Dangerous Minds clarified.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fed up by Sacramento's regulations and Southern California's political sway, residents in one rural Northern California county are taking steps to leave the state. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Siskiyou County Board of Supervisors voted, 4-1, on Tuesday to pursue seceding from California, the Redding Record Searchlight reported. Proponents say Siskiyou should form a new state -- called Jefferson -- with other counties in Northern California and Southern Oregon they believe share similar interests. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Tuesday more than 100 people filled the supervisors' chambers, many of whom indicated support for the declaration, the Searchlight reported. When a speaker asked those in the audience who was in favor, \"nearly every hand in the room was raised,\" the newspaper said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Many proposed laws are unconstitutional and deny us our God-given rights,\" said Happy Camp resident Gabe Garrison. \"We need our own state so we can make laws that fit our way of life.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The state of Jefferson is the place I want to raise my son,\" Kayla Brown said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Resident complaints include a lack of representation in Sacramento and insufficient attention to major issues for the county, such as water rights and a rural fire prevention fee, the Searchlight reported. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We have to have government that's local, understands our issues and has empathy,\" said Mark Baird, a rancher who the Searchlight said was heading the effort. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Supervisor Marcia Armstrong cited restoration of limited government as one of the reasons she supported the declaration. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We also have this enormous bureaucracy of unelected officials making decisions for us,\" she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Supervisor Ed Valenzuela, who chairs the board, was the only vote against the decision, the Searchlight said. He cited the oath he took upon his reelection to \"uphold the Constitution and uphold the constitution of the state of California.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I signed on to work within the system I know,\" he said. \"I don't like it, I don't agree with it all the time, but ... I did sign up for that and I will continue to do so.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Neighboring counties, which would be invited to join Jefferson, are also weighing secession. Humboldt County Supervisor Rex Bohn told the Times-Standard that his board would probably meet to consider their options. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I was one of the people who thinks the state of Jefferson wasn't a bad idea,\" he told the newspaper. \"There has been a total lack of respect of our water rights and the fire fee. Those things may not be important to the rest of the state, but it's important to us.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Secession efforts within California date back to the 1800s. The most recent high-profile attempt came in 2011, when Riverside County officials weighed a proposal to pursue the establishment of \"South California,\" which would have seen 13 counties leave the Golden State. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR [For the Record, 1:50 p.m. PDT Sept. 4: An earlier version of this post incorrectly attributed Humboldt County Supervisor Rex Bohn's comments on the state of Jefferson to the Redding Record Searchlight.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It's the first in a long series of steps to form the proposed state of Jefferson, which proponents of the effort say would bring representation to rural North State counties that currently are beholden to the whims of representatives of the more heavily populated Southern California and free them from burdensome state regulations. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201dWe have to have government that's local, understands our issues and has empathy\u201d for those affected, said Mark Baird, a Scott Valley rancher who's also president for Scott Valley Protect Our Water and vice president of the Siskiyou Water User's Association. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Baird is leading the charge to form a new state from rural counties in Northern California and Southern Oregon, though he certainly wasn't the only voice in support of the move. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR More than 100 people packed the supervisors' chambers Tuesday for the discussion on whether the county should issue a declaration that it wants to secede from the state. Nearly all those in attendance appeared to be for the move and about a dozen spoke in support of it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201dMany proposed laws are unconstitutional and deny us our God-given rights,\u201d said Gabe Garrison of Happy Camp. \u201cWe need our own state so we can make laws that fit our way of life.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Among those in attendance was Erin Ryan, field representative for Rep. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Doug LaMalfa. When asked for the congressman's opinion, she said that she and other LaMalfa staff members supported the effort to secede, but she did not know LaMalfa's thoughts on it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She also said there's support for the split in Sacramento. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The discussion also attracted members of groups from Shasta and Tehama counties who are looking for their own supervisors to pass similar declarations. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201dIt would be the only way I could see everyone coming together in a positive manner,\u201d said Tom Moller of Red Bluff. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Also there was Kayla Brown, a mother in her early 20s, who said she didn't want to raise her child in California. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201dThe state of Jefferson is the place I want to raise my son,\u201d she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At one point in the meeting a speaker asked for a show of hands from those in attendance who supported the split. Nearly every hand in the room was raised. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And supervisors echoed much of that enthusiasm in their own comments. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201dI haven't had one contact in regard to this issue, that's in opposition,\u201d Supervisor Michael Kobseff said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Supervisor Marcia Armstrong said the issues were about regulation, restriction of rights, lack of representation, regionalism and restoration of limited government. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201dWe also have this enormous bureaucracy of unelected officials making decisions for us,\u201d she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Board Chair Ed Valenzuela was the sole vote against the declaration. He said he was elected to solve problems within the system. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201dIt comes down to because I took an oath. I took an oath when I ran for re-election, which I just did, and that was to uphold the Constitution, and uphold the constitution of the state of California,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd within that, and because knowing what it's like to be a minority, I know the value of having to work from the other side without the numbers and without support. I signed on to do that, I signed on to work within the system I know. I don't like it, I don't agree with it all the time but at the same token, I did sign up for that and I will continue to do so.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In August, county residents lobbied the board to consider separating from the state over a laundry list of complaints including a lack of representation in Sacramento for the Republican-majority county, issues pertaining to water rights and the rural fire prevention fee. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If the county were to split from the state, any action taken today would be the first step in a long process that would require approval from the state Legislature and the U.S. Congress. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Siskiyou County would also invite other neighboring counties in California and Southern Oregon to join in the effort to create a new state. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The U.S. Constitution allows for the formation of new states, though land can't be taken from existing states without the consent of state and federal governments. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Humboldt County 1st District Supervisor Rex Bohn said he can understand the frustration in Siskiyou County and that he tends to agree with most of the issues that were brought up by the board. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201dI was one of the people who thinks the State of Jefferson wasn't a bad idea,\u201d Bohn said. \u201cThere has been a total lack of respect in terms of our water rights and the fire fee. Those things may not be important to the rest of the state, but it's important to us. This is a major thing for everyone that lives rurally.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bohn said the problem is that only 16 percent of the state is rural, and decisions in Sacramento are sometimes based on the needs or realities of more urban areas. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201dIt's kind of a drastic measure to get someone to listen to you, but I guess they feel like they're not getting heard,\u201d he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bohn added that the Humboldt County supervisors will likely meet to discuss the issue. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Humboldt County 3rd District Supervisor Mark Lovelace said he took the talk of secession as a statement of frustration. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201dThere has to be basic economic underpinnings to make a state work,\u201d Lovelace said. \u201cThere is a certain romantic appeal and allure to the state of Jefferson, this entire idea of what could have been, but in reality it would not be good economically.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He said one of the problems with a rural county seceding is that the tax base starts small. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201dSiskiyou is one of the largest counties with one of the smallest populations,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is also full of state roads that they won't be able to maintain, and federal land.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Times-Standard staff writer Catherine Wong contributed to this report.\n",
        "summary": "\u2013 Not a big fan of Southern California? Neither is Northern California, apparently. Supervisors in rural Siskiyou County voted 4-1 Tuesday in favor of seceding from the state, reports the Times-Standard. The county thinks state officials in Sacramento are too focused on the big metro areas of the south and thus want to form a state of its own\u2014to be called Jefferson. Supporters want to invite other northern counties, and perhaps a few from Oregon, to join, too, notes the Los Angeles Times. \u201dWe have to have government that's local, understands our issues, and has empathy,\u201d says one local rancher. It's clearly a very long-shot bid, one that would eventually require the blessing of both the state legislature and the US Congress. Still, neighboring Humboldt County is expected to meet soon to consider the idea. (Meanwhile, some counties in Colorado want to form a new state of their own.)\n"

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Microsoft has been working on its evolution into a devices and services company, away from the services business it has traditionally been, for several years now with limited success. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Its acquisition of most of Nokia is the latest acceleration of that strategy \u2014 to move further away from the moribund world of the beige desktop and towards the sunlit world of smartphones and tablets. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Owning the desktop (via Windows) and building additional services on top, like Office or search, has been vital for Microsoft's strategy until now, so as our interest shifts from the desktop to the tablet or smartphone it's essential to Microsoft's broader business (even Azure) that it can retain that connection in some form. To be a winner in the business market it also has to be a winner in the consumer market, something that wasn't the case a decade ago. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As Microsoft's own presentation about the deal, announced on Monday, notes: \"With the consumerisation of IT user matter at both home and work... We cannot risk having Apple or Google foreclose app innovation, integration, distribution or economics.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nokia lashed itself to Microsoft's mast after losing out to iOS and Android in the smartphone market share stakes and with the limited success of the Lumia range so far enough to keep interest in Windows Phone alive, most analysts are seeing a certain amount of inevitability to the acquisition, even if they are split on what its biggest implications are. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Forrester mobile analyst Charles Golvin said the steadily diminishing investments by other Windows Phone licensees has left Microsoft with just Nokia as its standard bearer and added Microsoft now appears \"poised to adopt a vertically integrated strategy more akin to Apple's\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But he said Microsoft's challenge remains how to unite the myriad services and brands \u2014 Windows, Nokia, Live, Surface, Xbox, Bing and more \u2014 into a cohesive experience that will command and cement customer loyalty. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"That's a tall order and one that should weigh strongly on the board's choice of a new CEO,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Richard Holway, chairman of analyst TechMarketView, said given that Microsoft paid $8.5bn for Skype in 2011, the price it is paying for Nokia \"seems extremely reasonable\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However, he added: \"Our only 'surprise' now is the timing of the announcement. For such a big deal to come just days after Ballmer stood down seems mighty strange.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For Holway, there is also an opportunity for the enlarged Microsoft to step up its business mobility efforts: \"There is undoubtedly a market opportunity for the creation of a provider of mobile solutions for the enterprise. Taking Office onto various mobile platforms. Providing secure emailing in a sector once occupied by BlackBerry.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But such a move carries its own risks \u2014 Microsoft's success has been build on being hardware agnostic and persuading device manufacturers to support it. Already its move into the tablet market with Surface will have unsettled its manufacturers which have struggled to come up with convincing form factors to tackle the decline of the PC. If Nokia's rumoured tablet appears too, this will further complicate Microsoft's relations with these partners who are essential for the success of Windows 8 (as well as Office and other products). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But, as Holway points out, \"on balance, Microsoft needed to make a bold move into mobile. Not doing so would mean certain terminal decline. This way at least holds out some chance of survival.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Carolina Milanesi, research vice president at analyst Gartner, said by buying rather than just partnering with Nokia, Microsoft gets deeper integration, the benefit of its patents and removes any risk of Nokia either going Android or being acquired by someone else. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But success against iOS and Android will depend on how the companies integrate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Nokia benefits from higher R&D spend as well as more marketing budget. Microsoft benefits from a good relationship with carriers, good direct channel presence in emerging markets, the potential of going after more aggressively to the business market,\" she told ZDNet. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But for Milanesi, business is a secondary concern, even if it is an attractive target where Microsoft, and to a less extent Nokia, have experience: \"First and foremost it needs to be about consumers. Enterprise are certainly a target especially considering the state BlackBerry is in but consumers make or break a phone vendor today.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR From Milanesi's point of view, emerging markets need to be a longer term target for Microsoft \u2014 but the battle needs to be won in the mature markets first. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For Forrester principal analyst Thomas Husson, Nokia adds to Microsoft's developing market strategy. It's looking increasingly likely that the US and western European smartphone market is reaching saturation, so that most growth will come from emerging markets. Here Nokia's Asha devices could play a neat role as an 'on-ramp' for consumers buying their first smartphone. Tied in with a revamped tablet strategy this could open up a new front against Android in particular. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Husson cautioned: \"This is going to be a long journey. In some countries, Windows Phone 8 market share is now above five percent and close to 10 percent. It thus still offers a limited reach for developers and marketers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Nokia is indeed still massivley popular in some emerging countries but competition is very high with Far East manufacturers and low-cost Android devices. I think it will depend on Microsoft's new strategy for emerging markets beyond just mobile phones.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR All of this shows the number of competing \u2014 and occasionally contradictory \u2014 demands upon Microsoft's management. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As the incumbent player in a fading market, Microsoft has a take into account those differing requirements as it tries to build for the future. For example, balancing Microsoft's business customers against the need to get into consumer tech, the need to build its own hardware business against the need to keep manufacturers onside, and building up a mobile business while protecting its PC heritage. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It's easy to look at Apple's integrated hardware and software model and the rich ecosystem that sits around it, but it's much harder to emulate.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 2003, Nokia's cell phone market share exceeded 35%. That same year, its phone business alone posted an operating profit of 5.48 billion euros. Today's sale price, which includes 1.65 billion euros in patents, is just 5.44 billion euros. It's been a rough decade. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nokia's cell phone collapse has been a spectacular one. The Finnish giant dominated the dumbphone era after Motorola, another faded star that recently fell into the hands of a comparative upstart. But it was blindsided by Apple, then deprived of a chance to regain its footing by an even more aggressive Google, which followed close behind. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The story, in hindsight, is simple: Nokia did not have a truly compelling smartphone ready when a large segment of the developed world was first compelled by smartphones. Whether this was the result of complacency \u2014 Nokia was, in the mid-2000s, the leader of the niche smartphone category \u2014 doesn't matter now. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nokia's miscalculations became impossible to ignore in 2008, the same year Microsoft decided, internally at least, to scrap its ancient and inadequate Windows Mobile platform in favor of something entirely new. Under these circumstances, it's easy to imagine how a sort of camaraderie might have emerged at the time, or at least a mutual sympathy. Certainly a shared interest: to break back into the market from which they had been unceremoniously expelled. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR During the next two years, while Microsoft readied Windows Phone 7 and Nokia floundered on, the seeds of Sunday's deal were sewn. A chastened Nokia was a natural partner for the tardy but determined Microsoft; it needed a software solution and Microsoft needed help with hardware. The 2009 vision of 2013 renders clearly: Two giants, united after some missteps, regain their rightful place. By 2010, when the head of Microsoft's Business division left to take the helm at Nokia, the gears were moving. Many at the time wondered if Stephen Elop's time at Nokia would be spent grooming the company for purchase \u2014 a foreigner in all possible ways, he began his time at the company with a memo rightly but offensively declaring Nokia's proud platform a failure, and quickly pledged the company's commitment to the still-tiny Windows Phone. It felt like a radical about-face, but no matter: Nokia and Microsoft were going to save each other. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now, with Elop returning to Microsoft after a job well done \u2014 well, a job, done \u2014that plan has come to fruition. The only problem is that there's little left to save. Windows Phone has barely dented the now much larger smartphone market. Nokia hasn't had a Windows Phone hit. This incongruity \u2014 between a successfully executed, slyly strategic long-term merger plan and a much grander, more general sense of failure \u2014 might explain Microsoft's deeply strange and somewhat sad stated goals for its Nokia acquisition. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Microsoft' s \"Strategic Rationale,\" titled \"Accelerating Growth,\" is a disjointed and bizarre document. It manages to sound both insane and uninspiring, outlining modest goals that still sound unrealistic. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For example, it lays out a plan to pull in over $45 billion dollars in smartphone revenue by 2018. But it plans on doing this by securing just 15% of the projected global smartphone market \u2014 not exactly a world-beating plan, keeping in mind the time frame. Consider: 2018 is five years away. Five years ago was the year the App Store first opened. ||||| Hello there, NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There is a pertinent story about a man who was working on an oil platform in the North Sea. He woke up one night from a loud explosion, which suddenly set his entire oil platform on fire. In mere moments, he was surrounded by flames. Through the smoke and heat, he barely made his way out of the chaos to the platform's edge. When he looked down over the edge, all he could see were the dark, cold, foreboding Atlantic waters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As the fire approached him, the man had mere seconds to react. He could stand on the platform, and inevitably be consumed by the burning flames. Or, he could plunge 30 meters in to the freezing waters. The man was standing upon a \"burning platform,\" and he needed to make a choice. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He decided to jump. It was unexpected. In ordinary circumstances, the man would never consider plunging into icy waters. But these were not ordinary times - his platform was on fire. The man survived the fall and the waters. After he was rescued, he noted that a \"burning platform\" caused a radical change in his behaviour. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR We too, are standing on a \"burning platform,\" and we must decide how we are going to change our behaviour. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Over the past few months, I've shared with you what I've heard from our shareholders, operators, developers, suppliers and from you. Today, I'm going to share what I've learned and what I have come to believe. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I have learned that we are standing on a burning platform. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And, we have more than one explosion - we have multiple points of scorching heat that are fuelling a blazing fire around us. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For example, there is intense heat coming from our competitors, more rapidly than we ever expected. Apple disrupted the market by redefining the smartphone and attracting developers to a closed, but very powerful ecosystem. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 2008, Apple's market share in the $300+ price range was 25 percent; by 2010 it escalated to 61 percent. They are enjoying a tremendous growth trajectory with a 78 percent earnings growth year over year in Q4 2010. Apple demonstrated that if designed well, consumers would buy a high-priced phone with a great experience and developers would build applications. They changed the game, and today, Apple owns the high-end range. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And then, there is Android. In about two years, Android created a platform that attracts application developers, service providers and hardware manufacturers. Android came in at the high-end, they are now winning the mid-range, and quickly they are going downstream to phones under \u20ac100. Google has become a gravitational force, drawing much of the industry's innovation to its core. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Let's not forget about the low-end price range. In 2008, MediaTek supplied complete reference designs for phone chipsets, which enabled manufacturers in the Shenzhen region of China to produce phones at an unbelievable pace. By some accounts, this ecosystem now produces more than one third of the phones sold globally - taking share from us in emerging markets. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While competitors poured flames on our market share, what happened at Nokia? We fell behind, we missed big trends, and we lost time. At that time, we thought we were making the right decisions; but, with the benefit of hindsight, we now find ourselves years behind. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The first iPhone shipped in 2007, and we still don't have a product that is close to their experience. Android came on the scene just over 2 years ago, and this week they took our leadership position in smartphone volumes. Unbelievable. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR We have some brilliant sources of innovation inside Nokia, but we are not bringing it to market fast enough. We thought MeeGo would be a platform for winning high-end smartphones. However, at this rate, by the end of 2011, we might have only one MeeGo product in the market. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At the midrange, we have Symbian. It has proven to be non-competitive in leading markets like North America. Additionally, Symbian is proving to be an increasingly difficult environment in which to develop to meet the continuously expanding consumer requirements, leading to slowness in product development and also creating a disadvantage when we seek to take advantage of new hardware platforms. As a result, if we continue like before, we will get further and further behind, while our competitors advance further and further ahead. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At the lower-end price range, Chinese OEMs are cranking out a device much faster than, as one Nokia employee said only partially in jest, \"the time that it takes us to polish a PowerPoint presentation.\" They are fast, they are cheap, and they are challenging us. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And the truly perplexing aspect is that we're not even fighting with the right weapons. We are still too often trying to approach each price range on a device-to-device basis. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The battle of devices has now become a war of ecosystems, where ecosystems include not only the hardware and software of the device, but developers, applications, ecommerce, advertising, search, social applications, location-based services, unified communications and many other things. Our competitors aren't taking our market share with devices; they are taking our market share with an entire ecosystem. This means we're going to have to decide how we either build, catalyse or join an ecosystem. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This is one of the decisions we need to make. In the meantime, we've lost market share, we've lost mind share and we've lost time. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Tuesday, Standard & Poor's informed that they will put our A long term and A-1 short term ratings on negative credit watch. This is a similar rating action to the one that Moody's took last week. Basically it means that during the next few weeks they will make an analysis of Nokia, and decide on a possible credit rating downgrade. Why are these credit agencies contemplating these changes? Because they are concerned about our competitiveness. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Consumer preference for Nokia declined worldwide. In the UK, our brand preference has slipped to 20 percent, which is 8 percent lower than last year. That means only 1 out of 5 people in the UK prefer Nokia to other brands. It's also down in the other markets, which are traditionally our strongholds: Russia, Germany, Indonesia, UAE, and on and on and on. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR How did we get to this point? Why did we fall behind when the world around us evolved? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This is what I have been trying to understand. I believe at least some of it has been due to our attitude inside Nokia. We poured gasoline on our own burning platform. I believe we have lacked accountability and leadership to align and direct the company through these disruptive times. We had a series of misses. We haven't been delivering innovation fast enough. We're not collaborating internally. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nokia, our platform is burning. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR We are working on a path forward -- a path to rebuild our market leadership. When we share the new strategy on February 11, it will be a huge effort to transform our company. But, I believe that together, we can face the challenges ahead of us. Together, we can choose to define our future. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The burning platform, upon which the man found himself, caused the man to shift his behaviour, and take a bold and brave step into an uncertain future. He was able to tell his story. Now, we have a great opportunity to do the same. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Stephen.\n",
        "summary": "\u2013 Why did Microsoft buy Nokia's phone business? We now know Microsoft's answer: The computing giant released a 30-slide presentation today arguing that the move will improve Microsoft's margins on Windows phones, which will allow it to invest more in the platform, which will accelerate sales and market share growth, the Washington Post reports. But John Herrman at Buzzfeed has another explanation: \"Fear of dying alone.\" Here's what he and other pundits are saying: The presentation \"manages to sound both insane and uninspiring, outlining modest goals that still sound unrealistic,\" Herman argues\u2014like capturing a whole 15% of the smartphone market. \"It's a fitting end for the close of Microsoft's Ballmer era, during which the company \u2026 missed out on the most important change in consumer electronics in decades\" while remaining profitable in unglamorous ways. Like everyone, Microsoft is trying to ape the Apple model, MobileOpportunity observes. But it's not so sure that's a good idea. \"There already is an apple,\" the blog points out, and other software/hardware hybrid companies, like Palm and BlackBerry, have been crushed under its heel. Maybe Microsoft should have tried to patch up its tried-and-true strategy of licensing its OS. The move risks complicating Microsoft's crucial relationships with other PC and device manufacturers, one analyst tells ZDNet. But he adds that \"Microsoft needed to make a bold move\" or face \"certain terminal decline,\" and that the price it paid for Nokia \"seems extremely reasonable.\" Meanwhile, Matthew Yglesias at Slate digs up a fairly interesting memo from Nokia CEO (and, perhaps, Microsoft heir apparent) Stephen Elop, in which he uses the story of a Deepwater Horizon worker leaping from the burning oil platform\u2014a seemingly desperate, yet necessary move\u2014to explain the company's shift from its own failed OS to Windows Phone. Of course, Yglesias notes, that move \"was basically a total failure.\" To read the full parable, click here.\n"

        "document": "After a year in which liberals scored impressive, high-profile Supreme Court victories, conservatives could be in line for wins on some of this term's most contentious issues, as the justices consider cases that could gut public sector labor unions and roll back affirmative action at state universities. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However, as the court's new term kicks off Monday, uncertainty surrounds several other politically potent cases that could wind up on the court\u2019s agenda. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Story Continued Below NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Litigation over state efforts to limit abortion by regulating clinics and doctors is making its way to the high court. And the justices are already facing a batch of petitions involving the rights of religious institutions to opt out of providing contraception under Obamacare. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Both issues seem likely to land on this term's docket, although the justices haven\u2019t formally taken up either. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Many in the Obama administration would also like to see the court weigh in on immigration in coming months, upholding the president\u2019s right to grant quasi-legal status and work permits to millions of immigrants who entered the U.S. illegally as children. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But it\u2019s unclear whether that fight will get to the justices in time for a decision this term or whether Obama\u2019s effort to expand his executive actions on immigration will remain blocked by a lower court order until the president leaves office. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Here\u2019s POLITICO\u2019s look at five of the most important cases the justices could grapple with soon: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A potential body blow to labor NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Public-employee unions and politicians of both parties are keenly focused on a California dispute about whether states can compel government employees to pay union dues. A loss for the unions could sharply diminish the clout of a movement already struggling with its political relevance. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The case, Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association, was brought by Orange County, Calif. schoolteacher Rebecca Friedrichs and other teachers, who are arguing that forcing them to pay union dues violates their First Amendment rights. They also contend that unions should have to get permission before collecting dues used for political purposes, as opposed to the current system that requires objecting employees to opt out. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThe significance is substantial, either way it comes out,\u201d said University of California at Irvine Law Professor Catherine Fisk. \u201cThe reason why conservative lawyers are bringing these case is the hope that a significant number of government employees choose not to join the union and certain government employee unions will be weaker.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Roberts court has not been friendly to unions, issuing a 5-4 ruling last year that prohibited mandatory union fees for home health workers but stopped short of banning so-called \u201cagency shops\u201d in government. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The new case directly asks the justices to overturn a 38-year-old precedent that allows all workers covered by union negotiations to be charged for representation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR How the case will be resolved is unclear, partly because the conservative justices often see limits on government employee\u2019s First Amendment rights when their speech is at issue. Fisk said the unions are \u201crationally fearful\u201d about what the court will do, but she thinks the justices might end up dumping the case after it\u2019s heard. \u201cI think the case raises so many doctrinal problems for them,\u201d she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Higher ed affirmative action back in the crosshairs NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Two years after punting the case back to an appeals court, the justices will take a second crack at resolving a dispute about the constitutionality of the University of Texas at Austin's affirmative action program. The case was brought by rejected applicant Abigail Fisher, who contends she was rejected because of her race. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The last time Fisher\u2019s case went before the high court, affirmative action opponents hoped it would serve as a vehicle to pare back preferences for racial and ethnic groups at government-run schools. However, the justices instead told the 5th Circuit it had been too deferential to the University of Texas\u2019s claims that the programs were narrowly tailored to promote diversity. Justice Anthony Kennedy won the support of six other justices for a decision that said such programs must be handled with \"strict scrutiny,\u201d but the decision did not suggest they were automatically unconstitutional. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Justice Elena Kagan has recused herself because she was involved in the case during her previous service as solicitor general. The real question is whether Kennedy will join the four other Republican appointees in setting such a high bar for affirmative action that many public colleges will abandon the preferences and admissions practices they use to achieve racial and ethnic diversity. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The meaning of \"one person, one vote\u2019 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A Texas case has the potential to deal a blow to Latino political clout, tilting the balance of power away from urban areas and towards suburban and rural areas with more white voters. Evenwel v. Abbott presents the question of whether state legislative districts can be apportioned using a count of eligible voters rather than a count of all people. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If immigrants (both illegal and legal) as well as children can be left out of the count, \u201cthe rural areas where voters tend to have fewer non-citizens or where there are fewer young people concentrated would necessarily gain,\u201d said New York University Law Professor Rick Pildes. \u201cIt\u2019s a reasonable inference if the urban areas are more Democratic leaning that they would lose power to more Republican rural areas.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Congressional redistricting shouldn\u2019t be directly affected by the case, Pildes said, because the Constitution says the U.S. census used for that reapportionment should be based on each state's population. But others say the ruling could spill over into Congressional redistricting down the line. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Religious nonprofits and Obamacare NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the Hobby Lobby case last year, the justices allowed for-profit companies to seek religious exemptions from Obamacare\u2019s coverage requirements. But now, several religious-affiliated schools and institutions \u2013including the Little Sisters of the Poor nursing home in Denver \u2013 have filed lawsuits, too. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They argue that the administration\u2019s process for allowing religious nonprofits to opt out of the contraception requirement requires them to violate their religious beliefs. The Supreme Court has eight petitions \u2013 including one that just arrived from the federal government \u2014 on this issue. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some prominent judges are effectively begging the Supreme Court to jump in by lamenting the refusal of some courts to protect the largely-Catholic religious entities from sanctions for failing to fill out paperwork that triggers the contraception exemption but also sets in motion coverage from others. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cHow ironic that this most consequential claim of religious free exercise, with literally millions of dollars in fines and immortal souls on the line, should be denied when nearly every other individual religious freedom claim has been upheld by this court,\u201d 5th Circuit Judge Edith Jones complained in a dissent last week. \u201cHow tragic to see the humiliation of sincere religious practitioners, which, coming from the federal government and its courts, implicitly denigrates the orthodoxy to which their lives bear testament. And both ironic and tragic is the harm to the Judeo-Christian heritage whose practitioners brought religious toleration to full fruition in this nation. Undermine this heritage, as our founders knew, and the props of morality and civic virtue will be destroyed.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The justices haven\u2019t signaled which of the challenges, if any, they\u2019ll consider but are expected to do so in the coming weeks. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Testing when abortion clinic regulations go too far NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Two of the latest tactics in the abortion wars could wind up before the justices this term: requirements that doctors performing abortions have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals and that abortion clinics meet standards for hospitals or surgical centers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An appeals court has upheld most such limits in Texas, but in June the Supreme Court voted, 5-4, to block key parts of the law until the justices decide whether to weigh in. Petitions to take up that case and a similar law in Mississippi are already pending at the Supreme Court. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Supporters of the laws say they are designed to protect women's health, but abortion providers and abortion rights advocates say the laws would force many clinics to close and penalize poor women who could not afford travel to distant clinics. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A similar Wisconsin law led to combative oral arguments in front of the 7th Circuit last week. Judge Richard Posner suggested the law was a transparent effort to prevent abortions, not aid women. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cGovernor Walker, before he withdrew from the presidential competition, said he thought abortion should be forbidden even if the mother dies as a result, \" Judge Richard Posner said to a lawyer for the state, in remarks first reported by the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel. \"Is that kind of official Wisconsin policy?\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThat perhaps is Governor Walker\u2019s personal view, but it\u2019s not a state policy,\u201d Assistant Attorney General Brian Keenan replied. Keenan insisted requiring doctors to have admitting privileges was a reasonable precaution to aid women. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThe admitting privileges would benefit the continuity of care for the woman when she goes to that hospital,\u201d he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Posner said the fact that the law was intended to kick in one business day after it was passed made clear the authors' intentions. \u201cThat statute can\u2019t be justified in terms of women\u2019s health,\u201d the judge said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jennifer Haberkorn contributed to this report. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ||||| The new term\u2019s biggest rulings will land in June, as the 2016 presidential campaign enters its final stretch, and they will help shape the political debate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cConstitutional law and politics are certainly not the same thing, but they are interrelated, never more so than in a presidential election year that will likely determine who gets to appoint the next justice or two or three,\u201d said Vikram D. Amar, dean of the University of Illinois College of Law. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By the time the next president is inaugurated, Justice Stephen G. Breyer will be 78, Justices Scalia and Kennedy will be 80, and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg will be 83. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThis coming term will again put into focus that the court is divided along partisan lines and that the 2016 presidential elections will be hugely consequential in shaping constitutional and other law for perhaps a generation or more,\u201d said Neal E. Devins, a law professor at William & Mary. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The current court is the first in history split along partisan lines, where the party of the president who appointed each justice is a reliable predictor of judicial ideology. Put another way, all five Republican appointees are to the right of all four Democratic appointees. It was not long ago that Republican appointees like Justices John Paul Stevens and David H. Souter routinely voted with the court\u2019s liberal wing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As a consequence of the current alignment, Professor Devins said, \u201cthe Roberts court has generated more marquee decisions divided by party alignment than all other courts combined.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The last term\u2019s big cases did not for the most part follow that pattern because Justice Kennedy, who was appointed by President Ronald Reagan and sits at the court\u2019s ideological fulcrum, voted with the court\u2019s liberal wing at an unusually high rate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement Continue reading the main story NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThe story of the last term is that the left side of the court did a lot of winning,\u201d said Irving L. Gornstein, the executive director of Georgetown\u2019s Supreme Court Institute. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThis term,\u201d he added, \u201cI would expect a return to the norm, with the right side of the court winning a majority but by no means all of the big cases, with Justice Kennedy again the key vote.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The cases on unions and affirmative action, for instance, were almost certainly added to the docket by the more conservative justices in the confidence that they would be able to move the law to the right. Both cases were created by legal entrepreneurs and brought on behalf of plaintiffs recruited by conservative groups. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Photo NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The case on unions, Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association, No. 14-915, may deal a blow to organized labor. \u201cIt could set the stage for a Citizens United-style reconsideration in the area of union dues,\u201d said John P. Elwood, a lawyer at Vinson & Elkins, referring to the 2010 decision that transformed campaign finance law. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The new case takes aim at a compromise fashioned by the court in 1977 in Abood v. Detroit Board of Education. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In Abood, the court said public workers who decline to join a union can nevertheless be required to pay for the union\u2019s collective bargaining efforts to prevent freeloading and ensure \u201clabor peace.\u201d But nonmembers, the court went on, cannot be forced to pay for the union\u2019s purely political activities, as that would amount to forbidden compelled speech under the First Amendment.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The California teachers who brought the new case say t collective bargaining is itself political, as it concerns public policy on spending, seniority, class size and the like. Unions respond that the case is a First Amendment Trojan horse designed to further weaken the power of organized labor. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The unions have reason to be nervous.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin, No. 14-981, the court will return to the subject of whether the Constitution permits public colleges and universities to take account of race in admissions decisions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 2013, in a short, vague compromise ruling in the case, the court refused to decide whether the admissions plan at the University of Texas at Austin \u2014 which combines race-neutral and race-conscious tools to achieve diversity \u2014 is constitutional. The court\u2019s return to the subject after an appeals court sustained the hybrid plan has struck many supporters of affirmative action as an ominous sign. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The case was brought by the Project on Fair Representation, a small conservative advocacy group that successfully mounted a challenge to the Voting Rights Act in 2013. The group is also behind this term\u2019s most important case on voting, Evenwel v. Abbott, No. 14-940, which asks the court to address the meaning of \u201cone person, one vote.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The court has never resolved whether state voting districts should have the same number of people, including unauthorized immigrants, children and others not eligible to vote, or the same number of voters. Allowing states to count only voters would in many parts of the country shift political power from cities to rural areas, a move that would generally benefit Republicans. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On the last day of the term in June, Justices Breyer and Ginsburg announced that they had grave doubts about the constitutionality of the death penalty and seemed to invite a broad challenge. It has not yet arrived, and it is hardly clear that a majority would be receptive to such a challenge. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The new term does have an unusually high number of capital cases presenting more focused issues, including a challenge to Florida\u2019s sentencing scheme, Hurst v. Florida, No. 14-7505, and a case on race discrimination in jury selection, Foster v. Chatman, No. 14-8349. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The court has not heard an abortion case since 2007, when it upheld the federal Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act. That seems about to change. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The most likely candidate is a challenge to a Texas law that threatens to reduce the number of abortion clinics in the state to about 10, down from more than 40. Should the court agree to hear the case, Whole Woman\u2019s Health Center v. Cole, No. 15-274, it is likely to produce the most important abortion ruling since 1992, when Planned Parenthood v. Casey reaffirmed the constitutional right to abortion identified in Roe v. Wade in 1973. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement Continue reading the main story NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The question in the Texas case is whether two parts of a 2013 state law imposed an \u201cundue burden\u201d on the constitutional right to abortion. One part of the law requires all clinics in the state to meet the standards for \u201cambulatory surgical centers,\u201d including regulations concerning buildings, equipment and staffing. The other requires doctors performing abortions to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An appeals court largely upheld the contested provisions, but the Supreme Court in June, by a 5-to-4 vote, stepped in to block the ruling while it considered whether to hear the case. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That suggests three things: that the court is likely to hear the case, that its decision will be closely divided and that the ruling will land in June, thrusting a volatile and divisive issue into the middle of the presidential race. ||||| WASHINGTON\u2014The death penalty is shaping up to be a big issue for the Supreme Court as it begins a new term Monday, with at least six capital-punishment cases on the docket and a recent wave of executions keeping the justices up late to field last-minute appeals.

        "summary": "\u2013 The Supreme Court is facing a docket of high-profile political cases that will test whether recent liberal victories were more fluke or firm conviction, the New York Times reports. The court\u2014which is divided 5-4 for conservatives, but saw Justice Roberts vote liberal on Obamacare and same-sex marriage\u2014will look at cases including unions, affirmative action, and possibly abortion. A primer: Unions: Since 1977, unions have been allowed to charge non-union workers for dues that go to collective bargaining efforts, but not political ones. Now California teachers have brought a case saying collective bargaining is itself political. \"It could set the stage for a Citizens United-style reconsideration in the area of union dues,\" a lawyer says. Affirmative Action: Abigail Fisher says that being white played a role in the University of Texas denying her admission back in 2008. The Supreme Court punted on her case in 2013, and now it's back on the docket. Like the unions case, this was brought by a conservative group that recruited the plaintiffs. The death penalty: Justices will decide on capital-punishment cases in Pennsylvania, Kansas, Georgia, and Florida, the Wall Street Journal reports. Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer have already expressed doubts about whether capital punishment is constitutional. \"One person, one vote\": Should state legislative districts be drawn based on their number of people or eligible voters? If justices choose the latter\u2014leaving out immigrants and children\u2014Latinos could lose political clout and rural areas will gain, Politico reports. Abortion: Justices may opt to revisit a Texas law that could reduce the state's abortion clinics from more than 40 to roughly 10. At issue is whether new clinic requirements are an \"undue burden\" on women's right to an abortion. One commentator believes this Supreme Court session will be ugly for liberals.\n"

(credit: Adam Woodward) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEW YORK (CBSNewYork) \u2014 A preservationist says he has found evidence that a Manhattan building is the former site of an 18th-century tavern where George Washington is believed to have enjoyed a celebratory drink during the American Revolution. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If it is indeed the home of the legendary watering hole, the discovery could mean that the building that is perhaps Manhattan\u2019s oldest is slated to demolished. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cAfter the English had marched up the Bowery and out of the city (in 1783), George Washington and Governor (George) Clinton stopped at the Bull\u2019s Head (tavern),\u201d preservationist Adam Woodward told WCBS 880\u2019s Alex Silverman.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The building at 50 Bowery, which has had many faces since, is being prepared for demolition so a hotel can be built at the site. Legend had it that \u201cthe Bull\u2019s Head\u2019s structure, cellar, bones\u201d were still inside, Woodward said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He decided to poke around and, in the basement, Woodward found what he believes are Colonial-era, hand-hewn and hand-planed joists and foundation walls. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cFound myself in what I am pretty certain is the 1750s historic tavern,\u201d he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Woodward said he felt compelled to investigate in the building, which once housed a chain drugstore and the Atlantic Garden beer garden, because time was running out. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cI just realized that it would be the last chance to solve one of the great mysteries of New York City history,\u201d he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cIt was pretty incredible walking back in time 250 years.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Historian and author David Freeland told Silverman that the find \u201cwould make it very likely the oldest building remaining in Manhattan.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That has Woodward hoping city officials will act quickly to preserve the site. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cWhat an incredible opportunity that the city suddenly has for this thing to re-emerge,\u201d he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR You May Also Be Interested In These Stories ||||| Photo NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Maybe George Washington slept there, or maybe he only watered his horse and ordered stronger stuff for himself. Either way, David Freeland sounded excited as he crossed the threshold where a famous Colonial-era tavern, the Bull\u2019s Head, once welcomed thirsty out-of-towners. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThere are treasures inside,\u201d said Mr. Freeland, an author and a historian who researched the site for a book about a beer garden that later occupied the tavern\u2019s place on the Bowery. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Photo NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But all he saw was debris from the building\u2019s most recent life, as a chain drugstore with a Chinese restaurant upstairs. He did not reach the treasures that thrilled local-history aficionados over the weekend \u2014 namely, some old-looking joists and foundation walls in the basement \u2014 because the steps were blocked by rubble. The site is to be cleared for a hotel. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The joists were discovered by a photographer and preservationist, Adam Woodward, who suspects that structural elements of the Colonial-era tavern were used in the construction of the much larger beer hall, the Atlantic Garden. It reigned as \u201cone of the show places of New York\u201d from 1858 on, The New York Times said when it finally shut down in 1911. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But what about the tavern where Washington established his temporary headquarters in November 1783 as the British withdrew? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThe whole issue of whether the Bull\u2019s Head was buried inside the Atlantic Garden was one of the great mysteries of New York,\u201d Mr. Woodward said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Until, apparently, the other day, when he got a look inside. He saw iron work from the 19th century and I-beams from later on. And then he saw a stairway to the basement, and headed down. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cAt one point there was a distinct change in the building material, from cinder block to a brick-and-stone foundation wall,\u201d he said. \u201cI followed that wall and found myself at the front of the building, under the sidewalk at the Bowery, and looked up and saw what looked to me like 18th-century hand-hewn and hand-planed joists and beams with extremely wide floorboards right above them.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He said, \u201cI was thinking, I am standing in the cellar of the Bull\u2019s Head.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Bull\u2019s Head opened around 1750 on the fringe of what was a still-young city concentrated below the Bowery. Washington and his troops marched down the Bowery and stopped there in 1783 before making \u201ctheir official entrance into the city proper,\u201d said Kerri Culhane, a historian who wrote the application that won the Bowery a place on the National Register of Historic Places. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The neighborhood \u201cwas a butchers\u2019 district in the 18th century and the 19th century,\u201d Ms. Culhane said. \u201cPeople drove livestock down from the hinterland and the slaughterhouse was behind the Bowery. That\u2019s where the trading took place.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It was also a home to the ancestors of future V.I.P.\u2019s. \u201cThe Astors started out as butchers,\u201d she said, but began snapping up land. They even owned the Bull\u2019s Head site. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But the tavern closed. Mr. Freeland wrote that the building became a store that sold stoves until the Atlantic Garden opened as a beer garden. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It was a popular gathering place for German immigrants in its early days, and in the 1870s and 1880s, the Atlantic Garden was raided repeatedly for selling beer on Sundays, when the city\u2019s excise laws appeared to forbid that. Mr. Freeland noted that the laws did not mention beer, only \u201cintoxicating liquors or wines.\u201d The Atlantic Garden\u2019s owner got off after one raid because the judge sampled the beer the police had seized and complained it was so watered down that \u201ca man might drink by the gallon without getting drunk.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Later still, the Atlantic Garden became \u201ca place where Tin Pan Alley songwriters would go to plug their songs,\u201d Mr. Freeland said. One tune that apparently got its start there in the 1890s was \u201cDaisy Bell,\u201d the song that turned the phrase \u201cbicycle built for two\u201d into a catchphrase. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Woodward said he hoped the demolition for the hotel could be delayed long enough for \u201ca proper archaeological exploration.\u201d (Calls to the owner were not returned on Monday.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cI can\u2019t think of another lot in Manhattan that has a more important history,\u201d Mr. Woodward said, \u201cand the fact that it might be intact, a couple of feet under the building, is an incredible opportunity to get on archaeological record.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ||||| Elected officials and the Landmarks Preservation Commission are both doing their best to launch a thorough investigation of what may very well be the famed 18th century saloon the Bull's Head Tavern, but their options are limited. Photographer Adam Woodward first documented the ancient, hand-planed wood joists and stone foundation in the basement of 50 Bowery last week, and both he and historian David Freeland are convinced that these are the remnants of Bull's Head. If so, this would be the oldest surviving structure in Manhattan by far, and as Woodward puts it, an \"incredible opportunity to get on archaeological record.\" But the fate of the site depends on the current owner, Alex Chu, who is demolishing the site to make way for a new hotel. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Landmarks Commission tells The Lo-Down that they're \"aware of the situation,\" but \"cannot require the owner to conduct archaeology.\" The best they can do is give the owner a list of good archaeologists.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR DUBAI (Reuters) - The incursion by an unmanned aircraft into Israeli airspace at the weekend exposed the weakness of Israeli air defenses, an Iranian military official was quoted as saying on Monday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Israeli air force shot down a drone on Saturday after it crossed into southern Israel, the military said, but it remained unclear where the aircraft had come from. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jamaluddin Aberoumand, deputy coordinator for Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, said the incident indicated that Israel's Iron Dome anti-missile defense system \"does not work and lacks the necessary capacity\", Fars news agency reported. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Iron Dome system, jointly funded with the United States, is designed to shoot down short-range guerrilla rockets, not slow-flying aircraft. It intercepted more than 80 percent of the targets it engaged in March when nearly 300 rockets and mortars were fired at southern Israel, the Pentagon said at the time. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The drone was first spotted above the Mediterranean near the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip to the west of Israel, said military spokeswoman Avital Leibovich. An Israeli warplane shot it down above a forest near the occupied West Bank. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Israeli parliament member Miri Regev, a former chief spokesman of the military, wrote on Twitter it was an \"Iranian drone launched by Hezbollah\", referring to the Lebanese Shi'ite group that fought a war with Israel in 2006. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Israeli defense officials have not confirmed this. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Aberoumand attributed claims the drone was made by Iran to a \"psychological operation\" by Israel, but did not confirm or deny them. \"The Zionist regime (Israel) has many enemies,\" he added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On at least one occasion, Iranian-backed Hezbollah has sent a drone into Israeli airspace.

Hospital sources in Gaza said Makawi died of his wounds. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The armed wing of Hamas, the Islamists who control the Gaza Strip, said it had joined in Monday's rocket attack along with the smaller Islamic Jihad group. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gaza has been under the control of Hamas since 2007. The Islamist group rejects permanent peace with Israel and the two sides fought a three-week war in December-January 2008-2009. The border is tense, with frequent clashes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Israeli army says over 470 rockets have been fired from Gaza this year, but it was the first time since June that Hamas had acknowledged launching rockets at Israel. A Hamas spokesman said the movement would not remain passive in the face of what it called \"one-sided\" Israeli violence. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Israeli army said it had targeted \"Hamas terror activity sites and terrorist squads responsible for the rocket fire\", but gave no details. Israeli forces say they will not tolerate such attacks and will hold Hamas responsible for them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gaza hospital officials said one Islamic Jihad militant thought to have been involved in the rocket attack had been wounded by Israeli tank fire east of the town of Rafah. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Residents of Khan Younis in southern Gaza said an Israeli tank fired at the suspected launch area, slightly wounding four children and damaging a minaret and a water tower. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Abu Ubaida, spokesman of the Hamas armed wing Izz El-Deen Al-Qassam Brigades, said the rocket firing was a message to Israel that it would not accept \"a formula of a one-sided aggression by the occupation on flimsy pretexts\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With Egyptian mediation, Hamas has made efforts in the past to clamp down on smaller militant groups that persist in mounting attacks on Israel, partly in order to avoid another devastating war. The Israeli offensive in the winter of 2009 killed more than 1,000 Palestinians.

According to CBS Minnesota, Wendy's employees claim that Eiram Chanel Amir Dixson became argumentative during a drive-thru transaction just after noon Thursday after the woman asked specifically for fresh French fries. Reports don't specify the condition of the fries, or whether she even received them, but do make clear that an argument followed. Employees allege Dixson reached through the drive-thru window and, after an employee threw a soft drink at her, proceeded to spray them with Mace. The restaurant manager was hit directly in the face while two more employees were also in the line of the spray, per the police report. All three employees provided similar accounts of the incident, according to ABC News 5. Dixson is being charged with felony use of tear gas to immobilize. If found guilty, she\u2019ll face a maximum sentence of up to five years in prison and/or a $3,000 to $10,000 fine.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR New Zealand volcanologist Nico Fournier said he traveled by boat to within about a mile of the new island on Saturday to take a closer look. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He said it's made mainly of loose scoria and its dimensions are about 1.8 kilometers (1.1 miles) by 1.5 kilometers (0.9 miles), and that it rises about 100 meters (109 yards) above the sea.

He said it would need to be made of lava or something more durable to survive. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fournier, who works for New Zealand agency GNS Science, said he was able to establish that the volcano was mainly belching steam into the atmosphere, and that the small amount of ash it was sending out was rising no more than about 2 kilometers (1.2 miles).

Tonga's Ministry of Lands, Survey, and Natural Resources tells the Weather Network the volcano is erupting from two vents. One is spewing ash and rock onto an uninhabited island; the other is underwater. An expert who came within a mile of the new island, 40 miles northwest of the capital, says it's roughly a square mile in size. But as it's made of loose scoria\u2014a dark volcanic rock\u2014he says it should erode away within a few months once the volcano quiets, the AP reports. If it were formed from lava, it might be more durable. Still, \"it's quite an exciting site, you get to see the birth of an island,\" the expert says. Ministry officials say rocks are being thrown some 1,300 feet into the air, while the volcano is sending steam into the atmosphere. Bits of ash are now climbing about 6,000 feet, down from 30,000 feet last week. That means planes diverted from the area can now pass over safely. However, ash and acidic rain are still showering anything in a 6-mile radius, killing tree leaves on neighboring islands, ABC Australia reports. The volcano last erupted over five years ago.\n"

        "document": "The U.S. Census Bureau reported Wednesday that 16 million children living in America received food stamps in 2014, or about one out of every five kids. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Census said that number is up dramatically from 2007, before the Great Recession, when 9 million kids were receiving food stamps, or about one in eight. The data comes from Census\u2019 2014 survey on families. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThe rate of children living with married parents who receive food stamps has doubled since 2007,\u201d Census said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The findings are likely to bolster claims from some Republicans that the Obama administration seems to have a goal of putting more people under government aid programs. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich in 2012 called President Barack Obama the \u201cfood stamp president,\u201d which led some to say his comment was racist. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The debate over food stamps has led to a sort of chicken-and-egg argument between Republicans and Democrats. The GOP has said the end of the recession should allow Congress to reduce spending on food stamps. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While Democrats have tried to give President Barack Obama credit for a rebounding economy, they also note that millions of additional people are using food stamps, and that the program should not be cut yet. The total number of people using food stamps has almost doubled since the start of the Great Recession, to nearly 48 million in 2013. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The number finally dipped from that peak in 2014, but just a little, to about 46 million people. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Republicans have tried since 2013 to cut food stamp spending, as part of their overall plan to slow spending and get control of the budget deficit. In 2013, the House voted to cut $39 billion from food stamps over a decade, and almost a year ago, President Barack Obama signed a final deal that will cut just $8.7 billion from the program over ten years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That cut was estimated to reduce food stamp benefits by about $90 per month for the hundreds of thousands of homes that use them. ||||| WASHINGTON The number of children in the United States relying on food stamps for a meal spiked to 16 million last year, according federal data, signaling a lopsided economic recovery in which lower income families are still lagging behind. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The roughly one in five children who received food stamps in 2014 surpassed pre-recession levels, when one in eight or 9 million children were on food stamps, according to the U.S. Census survey of American families released on Wednesday NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Republicans in Congress have sought to cut back on the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program or food stamp program as part of a larger plan to balance the budget. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Early last year lawmakers proposed $40 billion in cuts from the program over 10 years. The final farm bill signed into law trimmed $8.6 billion from the program, eliminating benefits for about 850,000 people, according to estimates by anti-hunger advocates. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Other findings of the survey show a rapidly changing America in which more children are being raised in single-parent homes and more young people are delaying marriage. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Of the 73.7 million children under 18 in the United States, 27 percent were living in single parent homes last year, tripling the 9 percent in 1960. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The number of marriages also dwindled last year with less than half of households in America made up of married couples, compared to three-quarters in 1940, the survey found.

There are currently about 46 million Americans total on food stamps, down from the 2013 peak of 48 million. The jump signals what Reuters says is a \"lop-sided\" economic recovery that has left low-income people behind, but it also underscores a fundamental partisan divide over social welfare programs.

Here\u2019s what to watch for Wednesday night. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 1. Will the Herman Cain Allegations Take Center Stage? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Last time around, Herman Cain was a target because his fortunes were rising, along with the popularity of his 9-9-9 plan. Much has happened since, and although his polls numbers have flat-lined, not tanked, repeated allegations of sexual harassment or worse seem to be on their way to derailing the Cain train. How will his rivals handle it? They could attack him directly; even the usually detached Romney edged that way Tuesday, saying the allegations against Cain were serious. But that might be unnecessary and counterproductive. Focusing on Cain\u2019s circus rather than, say, high unemployment is bad for the Republican brand, so they may instead let him bleed slowly as they avert their eyes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 2. Will the \u2018Not-Mitt\u2019 Movement Dent Romney\u2019s Armor? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Although it\u2019s long been clear that Mitt Romney was the man to beat in the Republican field, the last two weeks have seen the anybody-but-Mitt movement crystallizing like never before. Bookended by scathing attacks by George Will and Erick Erickson\u2014the voices of the Old Republican Establishment and the Upstart Activist Right, respectively\u2014and peaking with the creation of the website Not Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor\u2019s opponents have come together, Transformers-style. But behind whom? With most of the rest of the field fading or too damaged to take up the standard, Jon Huntsman Jr., whose once-promising candidacy hasn\u2019t even gotten as far as spinning its wheels, is making a late play, producing his own anti-Romney ad. Can Huntsman or some other challenger dent Romney\u2019s armor? Or will the unflappable frontrunner parry all blows with the effortless, bland approach he\u2019s used so far? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 3. Will Newt Gingrich Finally Join the First Tier? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With Cain potentially on the outs, could Newt Gingrich finally be having his moment? The former House speaker could appeal to the same voters as Cain (they agree on plenty, as demonstrated by their lovefest on Saturday), he\u2019s experienced, and his campaign seems to have come back from several prematurely declared deaths. Indeed, he\u2019s rising in some polls. But Gingrich\u2019s previous debate performances have been polarizing. While some of the more cerebral Republican pundits gushed over his oratorical and rhetorical talents, he has a tendency to come across as petulantly contrarian and needlessly pedantic. If he can temper those tendencies, the debate could propel him to the first tier of the race. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 4. Will Rick Perry and Michele Bachmann Show Up? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Long, long ago\u2014if you can remember that far back\u2014both Michele Bachmann and Rick Perry were first-tier candidates. Their chances at returning to the top tier are slipping away quickly, though Perry\u2019s ample war chest is a crutch. It will be interesting to see how they try to claw back\u2014if at all. Will Perry come across as giddy and drunk, as he did in New Hampshire last month? Will Bachmann figuratively show up?

        "document": "Let\u2019s start with the crossbow, because the crossbow is huge. I\u2019m sitting in the passenger seat of a camo-painted ATV, rumbling through the northern Louisiana backwoods with Phil Robertson, founder of the Duck Commander company, patriarch at the heart of A&E\u2019s smash reality hit Duck Dynasty, and my tour guide for the afternoon. There are seat belts in this ATV, but it doesn\u2019t look like they\u2019ve ever been used. Phil is not wearing one. I am not wearing one, because I don\u2019t want Phil to think I\u2019m a pussy. (Too late!) The crossbow\u2014a Barnett model equipped with a steel-tipped four-blade broadhead arrow\u2014is perched on the dash between us. It looks like you could shoot through a goddamn mountain with it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThat\u2019ll bury up in you and kill you dead,\u201d Phil says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The bow is cocked and loaded, just in case a deer stumbles in front of us and we need to do a redneck drive-by on the poor bastard, but the safety is on. SAFETY FIRST. Still, Phil warns me, \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be bumping that.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As we drive out into the woods, past a sign that reads parish maintenance ends, Phil is telling me all about the land around us and how the animals are a glorious gift from God and how blowing their heads off is part of His plan for us. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cLook at this,\u201d he says, gesturing to the surrounding wilderness. \u201cThe Almighty gave us this. Genesis 9 is where the animals went wild, and God gave them wildness. After the flood, that\u2019s when he made animals wild. Up until that time, everybody was vegetarian. After the flood, he said, \u2018I\u2019m giving you everything now. Animals are wild.\u2019\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There\u2019s a fly parked on Phil\u2019s long beard. It\u2019s been there the whole ride, and I desperately want to pluck it out, but I decide against it. Along with the crossbow, there\u2019s a loaded .22-caliber rifle rattling around in the footwell. And yet, much like the 14 million Americans who Nielsen says tune in to Duck Dynasty every week\u2014over 2 million more than the audience for the Breaking Bad finale\u2014I am comfortable here in these woods with Phil and his small cache of deadly weaponry. He is welcoming and gracious. He is a man who preaches the gospel of the outdoors and, to my great envy, practices what he preaches. He spends most of his time out here, daydreaming about what he calls a \u201cpristine earth\u201d: a world where nothing gets in the way of nature or the hunters who lovingly maintain it. No cities. No buildings. No highways. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Oh, and no sinners, too. So here\u2019s where things get a bit uncomfortable. Phil calls himself a Bible-thumper, and holy shit, he thumps that Bible hard enough to ring the bell at a county-fair test of strength. If you watch Duck Dynasty, you can hear plenty of it in the nondenominational supper-table prayer the family recites at the end of every episode, and in the show\u2019s no-cussing, no-blaspheming tone. But there are more things Phil would like to say\u2014\u201ccontroversial\u201d things, as he puts it to me\u2014that don\u2019t make the cut. (This March, for instance, he told the Christian-oriented Sports Spectrum magazine that he didn\u2019t approve of A&E editing out \u201cin Jesus\u201d from a family prayer scene, even though A&E says that the phrase has been uttered in at least seventeen episodes.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Out here in these woods, without any cameras around, Phil is free to say what he wants. Maybe a little too free. He\u2019s got lots of thoughts on modern immorality, and there\u2019s no stopping them from rushing out. Like this one: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cIt seems like, to me, a vagina\u2014as a man\u2014would be more desirable than a man\u2019s anus. That\u2019s just me. I\u2019m just thinking: There\u2019s more there! She\u2019s got more to offer. I mean, come on, dudes! You know what I\u2019m saying? But hey, sin: It\u2019s not logical, my man. It\u2019s just not logical.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Perhaps we\u2019ll be needing that seat belt after all. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Duck Dynasty origin story is the mighty river from which all other Robertson-family stories flow. And it is an awesome story, one that improves the more it is told, so here is my stab at it: Phil Robertson grew up bone poor in the northwest corner of this state\u2014a place where Cajun redneck culture and Ozark redneck culture intersect\u2014to a manic-depressive mother and a roughneck father. He was a star quarterback in high school and earned a scholarship to play at Louisiana Tech, but quit after one season because football interfered with duck-hunting season. The guy who took his roster spot at Tech was Terry Bradshaw, because that\u2019s how these kinds of stories go. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Phil On Growing Up in Pre-Civil-Rights-Era Louisiana NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cI never, with my eyes, saw the mistreatment of any black person. Not once. Where we lived was all farmers. The blacks worked for the farmers. I hoed cotton with them. I\u2019m with the blacks, because we\u2019re white trash. We\u2019re going across the field.... They\u2019re singing and happy. I never heard one of them, one black person, say, \u2018I tell you what: These doggone white people\u2019\u2014not a word!... Pre-entitlement, pre-welfare, you say: Were they happy? They were godly; they were happy; no one was singing the blues.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to Phil\u2019s autobiography\u2014a ghostwritten book he says he has never read\u2014he spent his days after Tech doing odd jobs and his evenings getting drunk, chasing tail, and swallowing diet pills and black mollies, a form of medicinal speed. In his midtwenties, already married with three sons, a piss-drunk Robertson kicked his family out of the house. \u201cI\u2019m sick of you,\u201d he told his wife, Kay. But Robertson soon realized the error of his ways, begged Kay to come back, and turned over his life to Jesus Christ. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 1972, with Jesus at the wheel, Robertson founded the Duck Commander company, which sold a line of custom-made duck-hunting calls that quickly became popular among avid hunters for their uncanny accuracy in replicating the sound of a real duck. He eventually sold half the company to his son Willie, now 41, and together they made a DVD series about the family\u2019s duck hunts, which led to a show on the Outdoor Channel, which led to Duck Dynasty on A&E, which led to everything blowing right the fuck up. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The show\u2014a reality sitcom showcasing the semiscripted high jinks of Phil, his brother \u201cUncle Si,\u201d his four sons, Alan, Willie, Jase, and Jep, and the perpetually exasperated but always perfectly accessorized Robertson-family ladies\u2014has become the biggest reality-TV hit in the history of cable television, reportedly earning the family a holy shit\u2013worthy $200,000-an-episode paycheck. It\u2019s a funny, family-friendly show, with \u201cskits that we come up with,\u201d as Phil describes the writing process. They plunder beehives. They blow up beaver dams. And when the Robertson-family ladies go up to a rooftop in a hydraulic lift, you just know that lift will \u201caccidentally\u201d get stuck and strand them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But the show, whose fifth season premieres on January 15, is just one part of the family\u2019s pop-cultural dominance. In 2013 four books written (kind of!) by Robertson family members made the top ten on the New York Times nonfiction best-seller list. Another book\u2014penned by Jase Robertson and detailing his Christian rebirth at age 14, his struggle to forgive his father\u2019s past behavior, and his young daughter\u2019s struggle through five facial-reconstruction surgeries to overcome a severe cleft lip and palate\u2014is forthcoming and destined to make it five best-sellers. There\u2019s also a book of devotionals somewhere in there, along with Duck Dynasty\u2013themed birthday cards, bobblehead dolls, camo apparel (pink camo for the ladies), Cajun-spice seasoning, car fresheners, iPhone games (from the press release: \u201cAs players successfully complete the challenges, their beards grow to epic proportions and they start to transform from a yuppie into a full-blown redneck!\u201d), and presumably some sort of camou flage home-pregnancy test. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It\u2019s easy to see the appeal. The Robertsons are immensely likable. They\u2019re funny. They look cool. They\u2019re \u201csmarter than they look,\u201d says sportswriter Mark Schlabach, who co-writes the family\u2019s books. And they are remarkably honest both with one another and with the viewing audience: Phil\u2019s old hell-raising, Si\u2019s traumatic stint in Vietnam, the intervention that the family staged for Jep when he was boozing and doing drugs in college (Phil placed him under house arrest for three months)\u2014all of it is out in the open. The more they reveal, the more people feel connected to them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And then, of course, there is their faith, which plays no small role here. During the family\u2019s initial negotiations about the show with A&E, Jase told me, \u201cthe three no-compromises were faith, betrayal of family members, and duck season.\u201d That refusal to betray their faith or one another has been a staple of every media article about the Robertson family. It\u2019s their elevator pitch, and it has made them into ideal Christian icons: beloved for staking out a bit of holy ground within the mostly secular, often downright sinful, pop culture of America. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Phil Robertson\u2019s house is located in the sticks about twenty miles outside the city of Monroe (pronounce it mun-roe). It\u2019s a rather small house\u2014the kind of place its owner would proudly call \u201chumble.\u201d The kitchen table is covered with big plastic tubs of cinnamon rolls and mini muffins. There are candy dishes filled to the brim, bricks of softening butter, and packages of jerky made from unknown animals, sent by unnamed fans. (I tried some, and it was awesome.) Just inside the front door, a giant flat-screen TV shows Fox News on mute at all times, and a bunch of big squishy sofas are arranged in a rectangle around it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Si Robertson is sitting on the couch facing the TV. Jep Robertson, age 35, the youngest son, curls up in a recliner in the corner with a pistol strapped to his waist. He barely speaks, like a countrified Silent Bob. Jase, 44, and Willie share a love seat while Phil lounges barefoot on a camo-patterned recliner in the far corner of the room. Two dogs share the recliner\u2019s footrest with Phil\u2019s heavily callused bare feet. He has severe bunions, so his big toes jut in at forty-five-degree angles. The main TV room is cluttered with mismatched furniture and photos hung haphazardly on the walls. And Phil looks like part of the clutter himself, as if he\u2019d been wedged into that recliner a while back by some absentminded homeowner who didn\u2019t know where else to put him. ||||| (Photo Credit: Getty Images) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jesse Jackson has decided to weigh in on the inflammatory comments that Phil Robertson made to GQ about gays and African Americans.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She called for external experts to be called in to carry out a thorough investigation into what went wrong, with the findings published in full.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cIt\u2019s an absolute tragedy to lose seven [now eight] animals in this way,\u201d Dean said. \u201cThe most important thing is for Kenya to do a proper inquiry and investigation into what went wrong.

(Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) \u2014 Eight critically endangered black rhinos are dead in Kenya after wildlife workers moved them from the capital to a new national park, the government said Friday, calling the toll \"unprecedented\" in more than a decade of such transfers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Preliminary investigations point to salt poisoning as the rhinos tried to adapt to saltier water in their new home, the Ministry of Tourism and Wildlife said in a statement, describing how the animals likely became dehydrated and drank more salty water in a fatal cycle. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The ministry suspended the ongoing move of rhinos and said the surviving ones in the new park were being closely monitored. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The loss is \"a complete disaster,\" said prominent Kenyan conservationist Paula Kahumbu of WildlifeDirect. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Conservationists in Africa have been working hard to protect the black rhino sub-species from poachers targeting them for their horns to supply an illegal Asian market. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In moving a group of 11 rhinos to the newly created Tsavo East National Park from Nairobi last month, the Kenya Wildlife Service said it hoped to boost the population there. The government agency has not said how the rhinos died. Fourteen of the animals were to be moved in all. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Disciplinary action will definitely be taken\" if an investigation into the deaths indicates negligence by agency staff, the wildlife ministry said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Moving rhinos is complicated, akin to moving gold bullion, it requires extremely careful planning and security due to the value of these rare animals,\" Kahumbu said in a statement. \"Rhino translocations also have major welfare considerations and I dread to think of the suffering that these poor animals endured before they died.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Transporting wildlife is a strategy used by conservationists to help build up, or even bring back, animal populations. In May, six black rhinos were moved from South Africa to Chad, restoring the species to the country in north-central Africa nearly half a century after it was wiped out there. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kenya transported 149 rhinos between 2005 and 2017 with eight deaths, the wildlife ministry said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to WWF, black rhino populations declined dramatically in the 20th century, mostly at the hands of European hunters and settlers. Between 1960 and 1995 numbers dropped by 98 percent, to fewer than 2,500. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Since then the species has rebounded, although it remains extremely threatened. In addition to poaching the animals also face habitat loss. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR African Parks, a Johannesburg-based conservation group, said earlier this year that there are fewer than 25,000 rhinos in the African wild, of which about 20 percent are black rhinos and the rest white rhinos. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In another major setback for conservation, the last remaining male northern white rhino on the planet died in March in Kenya, leaving conservationists struggling to save that sub-species using in vitro fertilization.

Per the AP, the black rhinos died in what Kenyan conservationist Paula Kahumbu calls \"a complete disaster\" after they were relocated from two locations to Tsavo East National Park last month. Officials suspect salt poisoning as the cause, pointing to higher salinity in water sources in their new home. When the saltier water made the rhinos thirsty, they likely drank even more, possibly leading to their deaths, the country's Ministry of Tourism and Wildlife said in a statement. The rhinos were among 11 moved to the park, and officials said the surviving animals are being closely monitored. The planned relocation of other rhinos to the park has been suspended. As the Guardian notes, the Save the Rhino organization estimates the total world population of black rhinos at around 5,500. The species is targeted by poachers who aim to collect their horns for the black market in Asia. Moving endangered animals from one sanctuary to another is called translocation and is done in hopes of establishing healthy populations in new areas. While deaths can and do occur with such moves, officials say a death rate of this magnitude is uncommon.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Joint Chiefs of Staff in Seoul says South Korea has increased surveillance along the DMZ following the incident and the military has activated its crisis management facility. However, there is no sign of any unusual activity on the northern side.

He is still being interrogated. \u201cWe'll see as he's debriefed and it's just a one-off incident, so I don't think there's too much we can read into it besides that at this point,\u201d says an analyst with the International Crisis Group. Pyongyang, not surprisingly, has not confirmed the incident, reports the BBC. The North generally puts only its best soldiers at the border after a careful vetting process, and defections are rare.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cMiner Gary\u201d Thomas said he always finds at least a little gold here on his property near Jamestown in Tuolumne County, but this year, there\u2019s so much more runoff than normal and it\u2019s shaking the gold from these hills. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Thomas said it could provide a \u201cEureka\u201d moment for those inclined to come up here and look for it. \u201c(The runoff) kind of \u2018etch-a-sketches\u2019 everything,\u201d said Thomas. \u201cEveything I had dug up and now my dig spots are all gone.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The known gold digs were washed out, trees uprooted, and landscape eroded. The runoffs have also removed gold out of the old abandoned mines and sent it down the river. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cIt\u2019s going to bring down more gold,\u201d said Thomas. \u201cIt\u2019s going to bring up new areas that I never got to.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Thomas runs tour groups through his property and said now is the optimum time for gold hunting because the storms have just finished churning the landscape. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Officials from the Bureau of Land Management say the erosion \u201cconcentrates\u201d the gold by removing the lighter rock and soil. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR You may be wondering if this reporter found any during our time here. We did find some fine flakes of what they call \u201cflour gold\u201d and it was found more quickly than normal in just a couple of panning sessions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cEureka!\u201d said Thomas.\u201dThat\u2019s hard to do.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But not as hard this year, now that Mother Nature has shaken up the motherlode. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Thomas said one hot spot this year will be below the Oroville Dam, because the huge water releases from the spillway could reveal some new pockets of gold. ||||| Joey Wilson, left, rings up Curtis Barwick for a gold pan and a portable slough Saturday at Adventures in Prospecting in downtown Oroville. Dan Reidel \u2014 Enterprise-Record NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Oroville >> Now is not the time to quit your day job in hopes of striking it rich. However, people with a new or renewed interest in gold mining may be spending more of their summer weekends near rivers and streams. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Joey Wilson owns Adventures in Prospecting in Oroville, where he says there\u2019s been more excitement among his gold mining customers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThere\u2019s always been gold in the Feather River,\u201d he said. What\u2019s new is that the recent floods have moved things around. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It\u2019s not just the Feather River. Floods scoured the banks of the American River, the Mokelumne, the Yuba and just about any other waterway where 49ers once got their boots dirty. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Curtis Barwick was in Oroville Saturday waiting for the prospecting store to open. He usually looks for gold closer to his home in Anderson, but decided to check out Oroville on his day off. He said gold mining gets him outdoors and helps him \u201crecharge,\u201d after a stressful week at work. It\u2019s a lot like hiking, another of his hobbies, but with gold mining there\u2019s a chance of a reward. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThe odds are greater than winning the lottery,\u201d he said. Even on days when he only finds a few flakes, it\u2019s fun to turn over rocks and sand. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He\u2019s not alone. In fact, he\u2019s a member of the Shasta Miners and Prospectors Association. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Back in the day, miners in the 1850s did not have metal detectors. Barwick bought one a while back and said if \u201clead was gold, I\u2019d be rich.\u201d He had found more bullet casings than he cares to collect. Other finds include coins, and a 1944 nickel. He gave his girlfriend a ring he found in the dirt, and would recommend that anyone who buys a metal detector have some fun digging around in their own backyard. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Others make gold mining an adventure. That\u2019s one of the reasons Wilson named his shop \u201cAdventures in Prospecting.\u201d He sells wet suits and fins, and personally loves to dive when he hunts gold. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Finding gold is a common thread for Cindy and Paul Pekarek, who were at the Montgomery Street miner\u2019s supply shop Saturday. The couple belong to the Mother Lode Goldhounds, near Grass Valley, and for fun they travel to new digs, including Oroville. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Paul Pekarek is a five-time gold mining champion, he said pointing to a pin on his wide-brimmed, black leather hat. The pin includes a miniature gold pan, pickaxe and shovel, with a real glob of gold in the center. To win the championships, he proved he could pan faster than most others. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some people, like Mark Saposnik, are \u201cpretty serious\u201d about gold mining. Saposnik spent his summers during college dredge mining. It\u2019s more difficult to find gold now that dredging is no longer allowed, he said. The recent floods have \u201crearranged the rivers,\u201d he said, and he\u2019ll spend more time stomping around. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Spillway gold? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gold miners can speculate all they want about gold that may or may not have washed down the hillside near the Oroville spillway. Before hydraulic mining was outlawed, hillsides up and down the river were washed away to unearth gold. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gold is heavy, and prospectors would love to discover what is among the debris at the Diversion Pool. However, the area is closed except for the work crew. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Recent word from Department of Water Resources acting director Bill Croyle was that he did not know if gold had been found in the area. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It\u2019s a moot point because \u201cif anybody gets close to it they will be run off,\u201d said Bob Van Camp, known locally as \u201cDigger Bob.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Van Camp was the spokesman in 2014 when a 5.18 pound gold nugget was found in the Butte foothills. The man who found the nugget has remained anonymous, but Van Camp was allowed to tell the story. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As for the spillway debris, Van Camp said he believes there is a gold vein that runs from Potter\u2019s Ravine and south, including the area of the spillway. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In addition to panning near waterways, prospectors look for quartz, especially chunks that have been worn smooth by water flow. \u201cThen you go downstream.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He\u2019ll also walk the higher ground with a metal detector, hoping some of that quartz will give him a strong signal. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ninety-nine percent of the time the quartz is just quartz, but \u201cnow and again,\u201d the quartz will have \u201csome sort of metal in it.\u201d This might mean manganese or silver, \u201cor there may be gold inside.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Part of the fun in finding gold is knowing it\u2019s something that an old-time gold miner missed, Van Camp said. \u201cI don\u2019t do it for the money. I just do it for the adventure, for the challenge.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He would love to get his hands dirty in the Diversion Pool at Lake Oroville right now. However, he understands that DWR is working night and day to get the water flow back to normal. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR People will be looking at other areas, where gold panning is allowed. After the floods of the mid 1990s, \u201cit was good getting for those of us who knew how to look,\u201d he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For an amateur, the adventure could lead to frustration. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to discourage people from learning about history, getting some fresh air and enjoying themselves, even if they don\u2019t find anything.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Right now, the water is still high. When dry times arrive, more streambed will be exposed, he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cI\u2019m going to have a ball this summer.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Know the rules NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The rules have changed for gold miners. Suction dredge equipment is no longer allowed, which includes \u201cmechanized or motorized\u201d systems for removing material from the water.

        "summary": "\u2013 This winter's flooding in Northern California has done more than bring relief after years of drought; it's created the prospect of the best gold prospecting in 20 years. Gold hunters in the area tell the Chico Enterprise-Record the floods have \"rearranged the rivers\" and \"move things around.\" That means gold veins that have been hidden for 200 years are suddenly exposed. According to CBS San Francisco, the floods also swept gold out of abandoned mines and washed it downriver. While KCRA reports that gold can simply be picked off the ground following major flooding, the best prospecting will come in the summer months when the water has receded. Right now, rivers are still high and government workers are trying to keep would-be prospectors away while they get things under control. But in the summer\u2014which experts say could be the busiest since the one that followed major flooding in 1997\u2014stream beds will be exposed for better gold hunting. \"I'm going to have a ball,\" one prospector tells the Chico newspaper. The epicenter for the new gold rush could be the Oroville Dam, which nearly catastrophically flooded this winter and required the use of an emergency spillway for the first time.

The Raleigh News & Observer says that Deena Murphy and Timothy Sullivan agreed to participate in the hit HGTV series under the guise that they were considering a move to a rental property with their teenage foster children. The problem, according to the suit against Big Coat TV and Aaron Fitz Construction, was that the show\u2019s principals\u2014designer Hilary Farr, real estate agent David Visentin, and contractor Eric Eremita\u2014are \u201cactors or television personalities playing a role for the camera,\u201d not people who \u201cplayed more than a casual role in the actual renovation process.\u201d While this shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise to anyone who\u2019s ever suffered through Farr and Visentin\u2019s bullshit \u201cno, you are\u201d banter, it\u2019s still mildly disheartening to hear. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For the episode, which aired in April 2015, Murphy and Sullivan were asked to deposit $140,000 into a fund with the production company, who would later use that money to pay Fitz and other subcontractors. According to the suit, the couple voiced its concerns about Fitz, saying it had below-average reviews on Angie\u2019s List, but they were ignored. Over the course of the renovations, only $85,780.50 was disbursed to Fitz, leaving the couple wondering where the rest of their money went. The suit also questions how Big Coat can operate as a general contractor, a role it\u2019s not licensed for. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Murphy and Sullivan are also claiming that Love It Or List It is even more of a scam than it generally seems, with the couple saying the show never used a licensed architect to develop plans for their house, and that they were never shown houses that were actually for sale in North Carolina\u2014or for sale by any licensed North Carolina real estate broker. They also say any work done on the show was work that they\u2019d previously made plans for with another company, Werx-Design Build. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to the suit, the actual work done on the house was \u201cdisastrous,\u201d leaving the home \u201cirreparably damaged.\u201d Duct work was left open, leading to vermin entering the house, and the couple complains of \u201clow-grade industrial carpeting, unpainted surfaces, and windows painted shut.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As the News & Observer summarizes, \u201cBig Coat\u2019s purported agreement,\u201d the lawsuit contends, \u2018admits that it is in the business of television production, not construction. ...

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Weier's co-defendant, Morgan Geyser, had already entered such a plea, often referred to as NGI, at a hearing last month. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At the time, prosecutors pressed the judge to inquire whether Weier might go the same route, since it requires the court to appoint doctors to examine the defendant and report whether their condition would support the plea. One of Weier's attorneys, Maura McMahon, said the defense had not yet decided. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But in a pleading filed this week, McMahon indicated that Weier now wants to change her not guilty plea to the insanity plea. A hearing was set for Sept. 9 for that change of plea.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tony Aiello was arrested Wednesday on suspicion of murdering his 67-year-old stepdaughter, Karen Navarra, on Sept. 8. Aiello is married to Navarra\u2019s 92-year-old mother. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Navarra, a pharmacy technician described by family as a \u201crecluse,\u201d was discovered deceased by a co-worker Sept. 13 after she failed to show up to her job. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Police said Navarra was found slumped over in a chair, clutching a large kitchen knife with a \u201cgaping\u201d slit to her neck. To investigators, the scene appeared to be staged to look like a suicide. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But a later autopsy revealed \u201cmultiple deep and intrusive wounds\u201d to her head and facial area, most likely inflicted by a small hatchet or ax. The doctor told investigators Navarra couldn\u2019t have inflicted the wounds herself and classified the case as a homicide. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At his initial interview, Aiello told San Jose police that he dropped by Navarra\u2019s home on Saturday, Sept. 8, to bring her pizza, according to court records. He also said he was outside his own home a few hours later, and witnessed his step-daughter drive by and honk with someone else in the passenger seat. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But police say Aiello\u2019s account didn\u2019t match up with what they saw on surveillance footage. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nearby cameras captured his car at Navarra\u2019s home for at least 21 minutes that day, between 3:12 p.m. and 3:33 p.m, but they didn\u2019t show her car ever leaving in the direction Aiello described, police said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Investigators noted Navarra was wearing a Fitbit, a wristband device that can collect data like number of steps walked and heart rate, when she was found, and they later consulted with the company to see if the device could offer any clues. A company employee told police Navarra\u2019s heart rate spiked at 3:20 p.m. Sept. 8 and then rapidly slowed. The device stopped registering a heartbeat at 3:28 p.m. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Aiello repeated his initial story after his arrest and denied that he killed his stepdaughter, according to court records. When confronted with the Fitbit evidence Aiello suggested someone else could have been in the home. He told police she couldn\u2019t have died when he was there, because she walked him to the door. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Police also found clothes in his hamper covered in blood splatter. Aiello told police he cuts himself frequently, according to court records. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Homicide investigators across the country have turned to fitness trackers to help piece together timelines, movements and other key information for their cases. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A Connecticut man was arrested after his wife\u2019s Fitbit data showed her last movements were more than an hour after her husband said she had been killed by intruders. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In Wisconsin, another man\u2019s Fitbit acted as an alibi. The device corroborated his story during a crucial window of time when police said his live-in girlfriend\u2019s body was being dumped in a field.

Police say they found Karen Navarra dead at her home Sept. 13 with a kitchen knife in her hand and deep wounds to her head and neck, ABC News reports. After the medical examiner concluded that she had been murdered by somebody who tried to make the death look like a suicide, investigators used surveillance footage to determine that stepfather Anthony Aiello had visited her the day of her death. He told them he had seen her later in the day\u2014but her Fitbit revealed that her heart rate spiked, slowed, then stopped while he was at the house. During a police interview, \"Aiello was confronted about the information from Fitbit and the corresponding surveillance video indicating that his car was in the driveway,\" police said in a statement. After police explained \"the abilities of the Fitbit to record time, physical movement and heart rate data,\" Aiello claimed somebody else must have been in the house. He also claimed that two shirts with blood splatter found in his garage must have gotten that way after he cut himself and shook his hand, KOAT reports.

        "document": "NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR University of Chicago / Facebook NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Amid a high-profile controversy at the University of Chicago over the value of trigger warnings and \"intellectual safe spaces,\" a male student is suing the Hyde Park school on the grounds that it is not a safe space for young men. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The unnamed student has been accused of sexual assault by his peers at least twice, but the university found he was not at fault after investigating the claims through its own process for resolving on-campus disputes between students. The lawsuit, filed last week, demands $175,000 in damages against the university. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The university has come under scrutiny in recent years for its handling of sexual assault accusations among students and is being investigated by the federal government for violating Title IX. Now this student says the school has swung too far in the other direction, creating a \"gender-biased, hostile environment against males, like John Doe, based in part on [the University of Chicago's] pattern and practice of investigating and disciplining male students who accept physical contact initiated by female students, retaliating against male students, and providing female students preferential treatment under its Title IX policies.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The lawsuit, which can be read in full here, details the relationships John Doe had with two unnamed women referred to as Jane Doe and Jane Roe in 2013. The lawsuit claims the relationships and his sexual activities with them were always consensual, but Jane Doe began publicly accusing him of sexual assaulting them in 2016, several years after the fact. The lawsuit excerpts a series of Tumblr blog posts written by one of his accusers in 2013 and 2014 as evidence that the relationship was in fact consensual. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Among other issues, the male student says he was harassed by the female students after one Tweeted about the alleged assault and a group of students staged a protest to boycott a student theater production he directed, and after his named was placed on \"the Hyde Park List,\"\u2014a very unofficial list of University of Chicago students accused of sexual misconduct that was disseminated anonymously in 2014. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The complaint relies on some common arguments used to refute sexual assault claims women bring against men: that the women are scorned lovers trying to re-write history out of anger, and that people who believe sexual assault allegations are biased against men because of the mainstream cultural image of men as more interested in casual sex than women. The lawsuit claims one female student had a \"vendetta\" against him and was retaliating after being rejected, and that the university operates under \u201carchaic assumptions that female students do not sexually assault or harass their fellow male students because females are less sexually promiscuous than men.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR [H/T Jezebel] ||||| A University of Chicago male student from New York accused twice of sexual assault slammed the school's conduct in a new lawsuit, charging that \"UC routinely portrays a large portion of their male students as sexual predators.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The student, named as John Doe in the lawsuit, claims the university violated Title IX with its unfair treatment. He was subjected to a \"fundamentally unfair, arbitrary and capricious disciplinary procedure that violates both Title IX and UC's policies and/or procedures related to allegations of sexual misconduct,\" according to the lawsuit obtained by the Chicago Maroon, a student newspaper at the school. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Title IX is in place to ensure that universities don't discriminate against students and faculty based on gender. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The male student, from Somers, N.Y., charges that two women, named as Jane Doe and Jane Roe, falsely accused him of sexual assault. Jane Doe is also being sued, according to the Maroon. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What you should know about reporting sex assault on campus NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The suit alleges that the school refused to allow John Doe to file a Title IX complaint against Jane Doe for harassment and retaliation, yet UC allowed Jane Doe to file a Title IX complaint to retaliate for an alleged sexual assault two years earlier. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR John Doe and Jane Doe became acquainted before their first semester in September 2013 through a Facebook page for accepted students, according to the lawsuit. John Doe and Roe met during their first semester. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The lawsuit states that after John Doe broke off his relationships with the two women, Roe filed a complaint with the school falsely accusing John Doe of sexual misconduct in the spring of 2014. The accusation was regarding alleged conduct that took place the previous December. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The school rejected Roe's claims \"despite UC's anti-male gender bias conduct and gross negligence in conducting an investigation,\" according to the lawsuit. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Brown student could be allowed back after sex assault suspension NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However, Roe then launched a vendetta against the male student, according to the lawsuit. She placed his name on the so-called \"Hyde Park List,\" a Tumblr page accusing six current and former male students of sexual assault or sexual harassment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Roe also \"falsely and maliciously advised members of UC's community that John Doe was a sexual predator,\" according to the suit. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The school did not take any steps to \"correct\" Roe's conduct, according to the suit, as John Doe was told the school's \"confidentiality\" policies prevented him from personally refuting Roe's defamation within \"UC's Community.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Roe then blogged in October of 2014 that the school was forcing her to participate in class \"with the person who sexually assaulted [HER].\" The school ordered John Doe removed from the physics lab they were both in, despite his strong opposition, the lawsuit states.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The other woman mentioned in the suit, Jane Doe, first mentioned in her blog that she had been \"sexually assaulted\" in November of 2014, according to the complaint. However, in her own \"vernacular,\" according to the lawsuit, the male student and Jane Doe \"hooked up\" in September of 2013 but did not have sexual intercourse. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jane Doe harassed the male student in a series of tweets earlier this year, according to the lawsuit. The male student filed a Title IX complaint against her, but the school took no action. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The suit seeks $175,000 in damages, according to the Maroon. ||||| A male student twice investigated for sexual assault by the University of Chicago has sued the school, saying its handling of the complaints against him demonstrated a \u201cgender-based, hostile environment against males.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The student, identified in the lawsuit as \u201cJohn Doe\u201d from Somers, N.Y., claims the University failed to treat him fairly after a University disciplinary panel cleared him of a sexual assault charge in 2014. The suit also accuses a female student of defamation for publicly saying he assaulted her and others. The complaint was filed on August 24 in federal court in Chicago. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The suit asks for more than $175,000 in damages. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The case against the University states that, in its treatment of the plaintiff in the case, \u201cUC was motivated by pro-female, anti-male bias that was, at least in part, adopted to refute criticism within the student body and public press that UC was turning a blind eye to female complaints of sexual assault.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The suit is part of a recent trend of litigation by male students at American universities who claim to have been discriminated against in sexual assault investigations in violation of Title IX, a federal statute that prohibits sex discrimination at colleges and universities that receive federal funding. So far, these claims have generally failed, though last month a federal appeals court ruled in favor of a similar suit against Columbia University. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The suit involves two separate allegations of sexual assault against \u201cJohn Doe\u201d filed with the University as Title IX complaints. The first allegation, filed by a female student called \u201cJane Roe\u201d in the lawsuit, was decided in \u201cJohn Doe\u2019s\u201d favor in 2014. The second was filed this year by another female student, called \u201cJane Doe\u201d in the lawsuit, over an alleged instance of sexual assault in 2013. \u201cJane Doe\u201d is being sued, along with the University. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The student the suit refers to as \u201cJane Roe\u201d said \u201cJohn Doe\u201d assaulted her in the spring of 2014. A College disciplinary hearing in May of that year \u201cfound that the preponderance of the evidence did not support [\u201cJane Roe\u2019s\u201d] allegation that [\u201cJohn Doe\u201d] sexually assaulted her,\u201d according to a letter sent to the plaintiff by former assistant dean of students Kathleen Ford. The letter was included as an exhibit in the suit. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The suit alleges that \u201cJane Roe\u201d told other people at the University of Chicago that \u201cJohn Doe\u201d had raped her and that she added his name to the \u201cHyde Park List,\u201d a Tumblr page that listed students it said had committed sexual assault or harassment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cRoe\u201d is not a defendant in the lawsuit. Instead, the suit points to the University\u2019s decision to remove the plaintiff from a physics lab with \u201cRoe\u201d after the case had been decided, and its failure to stop her from repeating her allegations, as examples of the University\u2019s bias against him as a male student. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In May of this year, the plaintiff directed a TAPS-sponsored play called The Bald Soprano, according to an email released as an exhibit in the case. Before the play\u2019s debut, flyers were posted on bulletin boards around campus urging people to boycott the show, and a protest was staged near the theater on the play\u2019s opening night. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cFor me, it\u2019s about supporting survivors, boycotting events put on by perpetrators of sexual assault, and accountability in RSOs,\u201d then second-year Emma Maltby, who participated in the protest, said when interviewed by The Maroon at the time. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At the protest, students held signs with slogans like \u201cSupport survivors, not perpetrators,\u201d \u201cBoycott rapists,\u201d \u201cSilence = violence,\u201d and \u201cHold your friends accountable.\u201d Some protesters also had tape over their mouths, with \u201cSupport survivors\u201d written on the tape. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Students protest in Reynolds Club. Zoe Kaiser NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At the time, protesters would not speak to The Maroon on the record about whether their protest was related to a specific incident or person. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Before the protest, the female student called \u201cJane Doe\u201d in the suit tweeted that the director of a TAPS show had assaulted her and other people on campus. The plaintiff\u2019s law firm sent her a cease-and-desist order in June, demanding that she stop saying that \u201cJohn Doe\u201d had sexually assaulted her or other people, formally apologize to him, and issue an apology and retraction on social media. As of publication, the original tweet was still posted on \u201cJane Doe\u2019s\u201d Twitter account. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In May of this year, \u201cJohn Doe\u201d filed a Title IX complaint against \u201cJane Doe,\u201d alleging harassment. Jeremy Inabinet, associate dean of students for disciplinary affairs, told him that the actions he cited did not constitute harassment under University policy and dismissed the allegation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cJane Doe\u201d then filed a Title IX complaint in June against \u201cJohn Doe,\u201d saying he had sexually assaulted her in 2013. \"John Doe\" then filed another complaint with the school, saying that \"Jane Doe\u2019s\" complaint was in bad faith and retaliation against his decision to file his May complaint and otherwise defend himself against rape allegations. The University initially told \u201cJohn Doe\u201d that it planned to pursue the case against him under the 2015 Student Manual, which had a different definition of consent from the 2013 Student Manual. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The suit says that \u201cit was impossible for John Doe to know whether his consensual physical encounters with Jane Doe in 2013 might violate subsequently created stringent mandates in UC\u2019s 2015 Manual.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The suit also claims that the University failed to respond to public accusations that \u201cJohn Doe\u201d had sexually assaulted people and treated him unfairly by agreeing to hear \u201cJane Doe\u2019s\u201d Title IX complaint. The suit includes selected posts from the female defendant\u2019s blog which it alleges show that their 2013 encounter was consensual. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The suit alleges that the female defendant\u2019s comments were defamatory, and claims that she and the University inflicted emotional distress on the plaintiff. It alleges, among other things, that the University of Chicago violated Title IX by creating a hostile environment, selectively enforcing its provisions, and retaliating against \u201cJohn Doe\u201d for defending himself against allegations of sexual assault. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The case states that the University\u2019s policy for Title IX investigations takes cues from the Department of Education\u2019s \u201cDear Colleague\u201d letter, which lays out how Title IX complaints about sexual violence or harassment between students should be handled by school administrations. It alleges that the letter defines females as the victims in Title IX cases and makes it difficult for male defendants to defend themselves in such investigations. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR All of the parties in this case declined to comment, either personally or through their legal counsel or press representative. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An August 24 docket entry by the clerk of the district court noted that the University of Chicago had agreed to extend the amount of time the plaintiff had to respond to the defendant\u2019s Title IX complaint, and to adjudicate that complaint under the definition of consent found in the 2013 Student Manual rather than the definition in the 2015 Student Manual. Judge Edmond Chang ruled that the case will continue to be conducted using pseudonyms for the plaintiff and female defendant, as the plaintiff requested. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The next hearing in the case is scheduled for September 14. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Editor\u2019s Note: Based on information available in now-public court documents, it is possible to identify the parties in this lawsuit. The Maroon chose not to identify them because \u201cJohn Doe\u201d is a plaintiff in a defamation lawsuit, and reporting his name might further this alleged defamation, and because \u201cJane Doe\u201d alleges that she is a victim of sexual assault, and The Maroon, like many media organizations, does not report the names of alleged victims of sexual assault without the victim\u2019s permission in cases when the victim\u2019s name is not widely known.\n",
        "summary": "\u2013 In a lawsuit seeking more than $175,000 in damages, a male student claims the University of Chicago has an \"anti-male gender bias\" and \"routinely portrays a large portion of their male students as sexual predators.\" The New York Daily News reports the student, named only as John Doe in the lawsuit, was accused of sexual assault by two female students. Despite being found innocent by the university in both cases, John Doe claims that he was the victim of a \"fundamentally unfair, arbitrary, and capricious disciplinary procedure\" and that the university violated his rights under Title IX. According to Chicagoist, John Doe claims the university disciplines male students \"who accept physical contact initiated by female students.\" The University of Chicago was recently accused of not doing enough for female students who had been sexually assaulted, but John Doe's lawsuit claims the university has now gone too far in the other direction, the Chicago Maroon reports. He says the university did nothing when the two women called him a sexual predator online and in public, leading to the protest of a theater production he directed. He claims the university ignored a Title IX complaint he filed against one of the women after she filed a similar complaint against him. The lawsuit states he was even removed from a physics class he shared with one of the women at her request. In addition to suing the University of Chicago for creating a \"hostile environment for men,\" John Doe is also suing one of the women.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The band -- made up of frontman Adam Levine with Jesse Carmichael, James Valentine, PJ Morton, Matt Flynn, Sam Farrar and Mickey Madden -- is currently on their Red Pill BluesTour, but conveniently have a break between a New Year's Eve show in Las Vegas and the Australian leg of their tour, which kicks off on Feb. 19.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One of the great challenges in choosing a halftime performer isn\u2019t just its mainstream appeal, but in finding an artist who hasn\u2019t already performed. Over the years, Bruce Springsteen, Paul McCartney, U2, The Who, Katy Perry and even the Black Eyed Peas have all performed, and of course the 2004 set from Janet Jackson (featuring Timberlake) was marred by controversy due to her \u201cwardrobe malfunction.\u201d Prince\u2019s 2007 performance \u2014 which saw him playing a galvanizing version of \u201cPurple Rain\u201d in a rainstorm \u2014 is widely regarded as the all-time best halftime set.

Kaepernick has not played since the 2016 season and his contract has not been picked up by another team, largely due to the controversy.

It\u2019s not clear what has ailed it. Maybe Spelacchio was unsettled by the trip; perhaps it was ill on departure. By way of explanation, Antimo Palumbo, a tree historian who was standing by Spelacchio\u2019s side on Friday morning, pointed at the concrete all over its roots. \u201cYou see that?\u201d he told me. \u201cThey decided to pour the concrete to keep it steady, but that killed it instead.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There isn\u2019t enough time, money or political will to replace the tree, and so Spelacchio the Mangy will stay in Piazza Venezia through the holidays, and for many locals it has already become a metaphor for what\u2019s wrong with the city, and the country. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Traffic in Rome is chronically congested, public transport is inefficient, trash collection is slow and sporadic. Early hopes about Virginia Raggi, who was elected mayor last year on an anti-establishment agenda, promptly faded amid familiar allegations of corruption and nepotism. ||||| Add this Tweet to your website by copying the code below.

Chatter spread quickly on social media where Romans traded jokes about the spruce and criticized its sad appearance.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cIt has clearly been traumatized,\u201d one expert declared.

The \"toilet brush\" of a tree now standing in one of the city's busiest public squares and being roundly mocked in Italy and around the world makes Charlie Brown's Christmas tree look lush by comparison. The New York Times reports that the 72-foot-tall Norway spruce erected in the Piazza Venezia and nicknamed \"Spelacchio,\" or \"Mangy,\" will cost the city about $57,000 in all\u2014and locals are outraged that so much money was outlayed for a tree that one expert says \"has clearly been traumatized.\" Thrillist documents some of the online reaction to the sad, needle-sparse spruce, which it calls a \"balding network of pines and brittle branches.\" \"Maybe the dogs drank all the water in the tree stand?\" one amused viewer tweeted, while another offered a backhanded compliment: \"Big fan of Rome's Christmas tree for looking how we all feel.\" Others defend the tree, saying it looks OK when it's lit up at night. \"We are all Spelacchio!\" one supporter told a local paper. Per the Times, the tree even has a few Facebook accounts and a Twitter handle in its name, with one tweet proclaiming: \"I have more followers than branches.\" A consumer rights group that calls the tree a \"shameful spectacle for citizens and tourists\" is lobbying to have the tree taken down and has asked a local court to scrutinize the tree's costs. Rome's mayor says her office is also looking into TreeGate.\n"

Kavanaugh is appearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday as senators continue publicly interviewing President Trump\u2019s nominee for the Supreme Court. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kavanaugh, a member of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, has a good chance of being confirmed when the Senate votes later this month. Under questioning from senators, he has so far touched on Roe v. Wade, said courts \u2014 not the president \u2014 are \u201cthe final word\u201d and, as the hearing began, watched drama unfold regarding Sen.

Grassley (R-Iowa) adjourned the confirmation hearing for the day. Grassley closed the session by praising Kavanaugh for his \u201ccompelling and credible\u201d answers, highlighted his history on the bench and said that \u201cunquestionably, you\u2019re qualified to serve on the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cI hope a lot of people in this country have formed very positive views of you, as I have,\u201d Grassley said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kavanaugh spent nearly 24 hours over two days answering questions, with many of the discussions on Thursday centering in some way or another on President Trump, who nominated Kavanaugh to the high court. Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, including some Republicans, pressed Kavanaugh about his expansive views of presidential power and past writings that concluded civil suits and criminal investigations of presidents would be better delayed until the chief executive left office.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u2014 Mark Berman NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 8:55 p.m.: Behind the dramatic release of once-concealed documents NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The dramatic release Thursday of once-concealed documents from Supreme Court nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh\u2019s tenure in the George W. Bush White House spotlighted the simmering frustrations from Democrats over how Republicans have kept secret vast parts of Kavanaugh\u2019s voluminous paper trail. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tens of thousands of pages from Kavanaugh\u2019s records have been hidden from public view, only available to senators and certain congressional aides in advance of Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation hearings this week. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Thursday, a small sample of the \u201ccommittee confidential\u201d documents were disclosed after Democratic senators asked that they be approved for public release, raising questions about why the documents had been considered confidential in the first place.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 7:30 p.m.: Pressed on gay rights, Kavanaugh declines to say same-sex marriage ruling was correctly decided NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) pressed Kavanaugh for the first time Thursday night about gay rights. The judge refused to answer whether the high court\u2019s ruling declaring a constitutional right for same-sex couples to marry was correctly decided. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, the man Kavanaugh would replace on the bench, cast the deciding vote in the case, Obergefell v. Hodges. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kavanaugh instead read aloud from another Kennedy ruling this year involving gay rights in which the justice wrote that gay people \u201ccannot be treated as social outcasts or as inferior in dignity and worth.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Harris noted that Kavanaugh earlier this week characterized the landmark decision declaring segregated schools unconstitutional as a great moment in history, and asked whether the high court\u2019s decision legalizing gay marriage was a similar moment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The judge said only that it was precedent. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The White House sent out information on Kavanaugh\u2019s record on gay rights soon after the exchange, noting that Kavanaugh has not had a major case involving gay rights in his 12 years on the D.C. Circuit. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cKavanaugh rules fairly and impartially based on the law, not the identity of the parties before him, and he has a record of faithfully applying legal protections for racial minorities, women, and other protected groups,\u201dthe White House statement said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u2014 Ann E. Marimow NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 7:11 p.m.: Kavanaugh, pressed again, said he has not discussed the Mueller probe NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), who late Wednesday asked Kavanaugh if he had discussed special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election with attorneys at the law firm founded by President Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Marc Kasowitz, questioned him again Thursday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Picking up a line of inquiry that her colleagues, including Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), had followed during the day, Harris peppered him with follow-up questions. Noting that he had denied having \u201cinappropriate\u201d conversations about it, Harris asking Kavanaugh if he had discussions regarding the special counsel\u2019s probe and whether he had discussed it with anyone at Kasowitz\u2019s firm, saying she had unspecified \u201creliable information\u201d he had done the latter. (The firm denied this earlier in the day). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kavanaugh asked Harris if she was asking whether he spoke to anyone specific about it, but she said that was not the question. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThat is not the subject of the question, sir,\u201d she said. \u201cThe subject of the question is you and whether you were part of a conversation regarding special counsel Mueller\u2019s investigation.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kavanaugh, nearly a day after their exchange late Wednesday, responded: \u201cThe answer\u2019s no.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Harris replied by thanking him and saying \u201cit would have been great if you could\u2019ve said that last night,\u201d prompting Kavanaugh to begin a reply before cutting him off. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cLet\u2019s move on,\u201d Harris said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The end of the exchange prompted a rare reaction from White House counsel Donald McGahn, who has largely kept his poker face during the hearings while seated behind Kavanaugh in clear view of the cameras. After Harris\u2019s remark about moving on, McGahn gave a slight shake of his head and briefly arched his eyebrows. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u2014 Mark Berman NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 6:52 p.m.: Booker asks why Kavanaugh won\u2019t recuse himself from the Mueller probe NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hours after Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) took center stage with drama over some of the documents the committee had, he had a chance to speak to Kavanaugh, pressing the judge on a variation of a question he had been asked previously during the hearings: Why not recuse himself from any court matters that would involve the ongoing special counsel probe because, as Booker said, \u201cit\u2019s really important that the Supreme Court be above suspicion\u201d? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kavanaugh responded by saying doing so would mean showing he did not have judicial independence. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cAll I would be doing is demonstrating that I don\u2019t have the independence of the judiciary \u2026 that is necessary to be a good judge,\u201d Kavanaugh responded. \u201cAll of the nominees who\u2019ve gone before have declined to commit because that would be inconsistent with judicial independence.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u2014 Seung Min Kim NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 5:50 p.m.: Hearing pauses for dinner NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The hearing was halted until 6:15 p.m. for a dinner break. After that, four senators will get their turns to question Kavanaugh before the committee opens up a new round of questioning. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 5:15 p.m.: Kavanaugh declines to condemn Trump\u2019s attacks on judiciary NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kavanaugh refused to repudiate what Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) described as President Trump\u2019s \u201cblatant, craven and repeated attacks\u201d on the federal judiciary. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Blumenthal was referring to Trump\u2019s criticism that Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg \u201chas embarrassed us all\u201d and \u201cher mind is shot.\u201d Ginsburg had been critical of Trump, prompting him to make the comments on Twitter during the 2016 presidential campaign. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kavanaugh took a pass, saying he did not want to \u201cget within three Zip codes\u201d of such a political controversy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Blumemthal noted that the president\u2019s first Supreme Court pick, Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, explicitly condemned Trump\u2019s attacks as \u201cdisheartening\u201d and \u201cdemoralizing.\u201d Gorsuch spoke generally, but his comments came after the president had criticized the ethnic background of Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who ruled against the administration\u2019s travel ban. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) followed up, suggesting that the judge was resisting any criticism of President Trump. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kavanaugh disagreed. As a judge, he said, \u201cWe stay out of politics, we don\u2019t comment on comments made by politicians.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u2014 Ann E. Marimow NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 5:08 p.m.: Blumenthal presses Kavanaugh on Mueller probe NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The ongoing special counsel investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election took center stage at the hearing again Thursday afternoon \u2014 this time, in a line of questioning from Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Following questions on Wednesday night and again Thursday morning, Kavanaugh was again pressed about special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s probe, which could eventually make its way before a Supreme Court featuring Kavanaugh as a member. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Blumenthal asked Kavanaugh if he had ever discussed the investigation with anyone, and Kavanaugh echoed his earlier remark in saying: \u201cI\u2019ve had no inappropriate discussions with anyone.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Blumenthal followed that by asking if the judge had ever discussed the investigation with anyone, whether appropriately or inappropriately. Kavanaugh acknowledged that it had come up \u2014 \u201cIf you\u2019re walking around in America it\u2019s coming up, senator\u201d \u2014 but he also repeatedly emphasized that he never crossed any lines in discussing it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cI\u2019ve never suggested anything about my views about anything, commitments, foreshadowing, I\u2019ve had no inappropriate discussions,\u201d he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Blumenthal then pivoted to asking if Kavanaugh had discussed it with anyone in the White House, including Donald McGahn, the White House counsel seated behind Kavanaugh during the hearings. When Blumenthal asked Kavanaugh if he had discussed the probe with McGahn or anyone else in the White House, calling it a yes or no question, Kavanaugh said: \u201cI\u2019m not remembering any discussions like that.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He added, though, that during his preparations for the confirmation hearings, he had readied for queries like the ones Blumenthal had posed. The questioning grew mildly tense, with Blumenthal suggesting that Kavanaugh\u2019s answers were ambiguous, which the judge disputed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After Blumenthal finished his questioning, Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) broke in to ask Kavanaugh if he had ever suggested to anyone how he would rule on any matter related to the Mueller probe, and the judge answered: \u201cNo, I have not.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Blumenthal followed up his questions about the probe by asking whether Kavanaugh had discussed the inquiry with anyone at the law firm founded by President Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Marc Kasowitz. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Earlier on Thursday, the firm Kasowitz Benson Torres said in a statement that \u201cno discussions\u201d regarding the probe had occurred \u201cbetween Judge Kavanaugh and anyone at our firm.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When asked by Blumenthal, Kavanaugh echoed his earlier comments that he did not remember any discussions with anyone at the firm about the probe. When asked if he knew Kasowitz, Kavanaugh said no. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When asked if he knew anyone at the firm, Kavanaugh said yes, naming Ed McNally, who used to work at the White House counsel\u2019s office and is now at the firm. Kavanaugh said he had not discussed the special counsel\u2019s probe with McNally. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u2014 Mark Berman NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 3:35 p.m.: Kavanaugh tries to clarify involvement in judge\u2019s confirmation NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kavanaugh on Thursday discussed his involvement in the confirmation of now-Judge William H. Pryor Jr. to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit \u2014 clarifying his testimony from 2004 when he said he hadn\u2019t handled that nomination when he served as an associate White House counsel. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The nominee\u2019s comments came after the new disclosure of emails earlier Thursday that detailed what appeared to be Kavanaugh\u2019s involvement in Pryor\u2019s confirmation fight, including conference calls to coordinate strategy and meetings to discuss plans for the nominee\u2019s hearings. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kavanaugh explained Thursday that in the George W. Bush White House counsel\u2019s office, one person would be assigned to handle the confirmation of each judicial nominee. \u201cAs I recall at least, I was not the primary person on that,\u201d Kavanaugh said, referring to Pryor\u2019s nomination. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While Kavanaugh said he didn\u2019t recall specifics of his involvement, some examples he cited were attendance at meetings and mock hearing sessions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 2004, during his confirmation hearing for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, Kavanaugh said several times under questioning by then-Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) that he had not been involved with Pryor\u2019s confirmation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cI am familiar generally with Mr. Pryor, but that was not one that I worked on personally,\u201d Kavanaugh testified then, although he noted during the hearing that he knew Pryor. Upon further questioning, Kavanaugh said: \u201cI was not involved in handling his nomination.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kavanaugh, with the help of Grassley, clarified another one of the emails involving Pryor. On Dec. 16, 2002, Kavanaugh received an email from another White House aide with the subject line \u201cCA11\u201d \u2014 a reference to the 11th Circuit. The aide, Kyle Sampson, asked: \u201cHow did the Pryor interview go?\u201d Kavanaugh then responded: \u201cCall me.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Grassley, noting that Democrats attempted to \u201cinsinuate that you interviewed Judge Pryor,\u201d asked Kavanaugh: It\u2019s \u201cmore likely to indicate that you know the people who interviewed Judge Pryor?\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kavanaugh responded: \u201cThat sounds correct.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u2014 Seung Min Kim NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 2:56 p.m.: Kavanaugh elaborates on dissent on contraception and religious objections NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advocates for reproductive rights are concerned about the contraceptive-coverage requirement in the Affordable Care Act, widely known as Obamacare. In a 2015 case, Kavanaugh dissented from his colleagues and sided with the group Priests for Life, which argued that a provision in the law to opt out for religious objections was too burdensome. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kavanaugh elaborated Thursday on the basis for his dissent, telling Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) that \u201cthe government had ways to ensure contraceptive coverage without doing so on the backs of religious objectors.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The issue remains in court after the Trump administration issued new rules making it easier for employers to refuse to provide coverage for birth control on the basis of religious objections. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cruz also asked the judge about a case on which he worked as a lawyer in private practice in which he backed a high school\u2019s decision to allow student-led prayers over the public address system at football games. He argued that students were delivering their own messages, not speaking on behalf of the school. The Supreme Court disagreed, finding the policy unconstitutional. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cReligious people, speakers and speech are entitled to equal treatment,\u201d Kavanaugh said Thursday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u2014 Ann E. Marimow NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 2:41 p.m.: Kasowitz firm denies discussing special counsel probe with Kavanaugh NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In one of the most widely noticed parts of the hearings, Kavanaugh was questioned late Wednesday by Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) about whether he had discussed special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election with attorneys at the law firm founded by President Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Marc Kasowitz. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Thursday, Kavanaugh was asked again about this by Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), who gave the judge an opportunity to clarify his responses to Harris. Kavanaugh said he did not \u201crecall any conversations of that kind,\u201d adding that he was not familiar with the names of all of the attorneys from the firm Kasowitz Benson Torres. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kavanaugh said he had not had any \u201cinappropriate conversations\u201d or commented on his views about the legal aspects of the probe, elements of which could potentially make it to the Supreme Court. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Thursday, the Kasowitz firm also said that no one there had discussed the probe with Kavanaugh. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThere have been no discussions regarding Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation between Judge Kavanaugh and anyone at our firm,\u201d the law firm said in a statement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u2014 Mark Berman NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 1:57 p.m.: Hearings resume after lunch break NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After pausing for lunch, the hearings are getting back underway. The first hours brought an extended drama over documents as well as questions about abortion, executive power and the special counsel\u2019s probe, with extensive questioning still expected for the remainder of the day. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 1:38 p.m.: The drama over \u2018confidential\u2019 emails \u2014 which were already cleared for public release NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Democrats mounted dramatic protests Thursday over documents related to Supreme Court nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh\u2019s tenure in the George W. Bush White House, as senators began releasing his emails that had been withheld from the public. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The records that Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) posted on their websites Thursday morning had, in fact, already been cleared for public release, according to Democratic and Republican aides on the Senate Judiciary Committee. Those documents were cleared earlier Thursday morning, according to spokesmen for both sides. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nevertheless, the drama over the emails once marked \u201ccommittee confidential\u201d engulfed much of the third day of Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation hearings, with Booker vowing to disclose them in defiance of Senate rules. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cI openly invite and accept the consequences of releasing that email right now,\u201d Booker said. \u201cThe emails are being withheld from the public have nothing to do with national security.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bill Burck, Bush\u2019s presidential records representative, said later Thursday, \u201cWe cleared the documents last night shortly after Senator Booker\u2019s staff asked us to. We were surprised to learn about Senator Booker\u2019s histrionics this morning because we had already told him he could use the documents publicly. In fact, we have said yes to every request made by the Senate Democrats to make documents public.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Such theatrics have characterized Kavanaugh\u2019s hearings, in which Democrats have repeatedly complained that Republicans have withheld documents from the committee and the public that shed important light on Kavanaugh\u2019s past. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The documents that took center stage on Thursday were labeled \u201ccommittee confidential\u201d \u2014 available for any senators to view but shielded from the public. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Late Wednesday, a handful of Democratic senators sent Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) several requests to make emails once marked \u201ccommittee confidential\u201d available to the public so they could discuss them during the public hearing on Thursday. Those records are being cleared as the Justice Department reviews them, as well as representatives for Bush. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Booker may have violated Senate rules late Wednesday, when he spoke about the content of emails that technically were still under \u201ccommittee confidential\u201d status at that point. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cYou\u2019ve also written that an effort designed to benefit minority-owned businesses, an effort to try to give them a fair shake because they had been historically excluded \u2014 and these are your words now \u2014 used a lot of legalisms and disguises to mask what is, in reality, a naked racial set-aside. That\u2019s what you said. That\u2019s how you referred to it,\u201d Booker said, referring to one of the emails from Kavanaugh. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Later in his questioning, Booker referred again to the committee confidential emails: \u201cI have letters here, sir, that have asked for \u2014 now, the one email specifically entitled racial profiling that somehow \u2014 I mean, literally the email was entitled racial profiling, that somehow was designated as something that the public couldn\u2019t see. This wasn\u2019t \u2014 this wasn\u2019t personal information.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Releasing \u201ccommittee confidential\u201d information violates Senate rules and could result in expulsion from the Senate. But whether the Senate actually pursues the violation is a separate question. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u2014 Seung Min Kim NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 1:17 p.m.: Hearing pauses for lunch NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Grassley paused the hearing for a lunch break, which he said would take 30 minutes but potentially longer, noting that senators have two votes scheduled this afternoon. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 1:10 p.m.: Court orders, not the president, are \u201cthe final word,\u201d Kavanaugh says NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Senate Democrats raised concerns Thursday about the president\u2019s attacks this week on the Justice Department and Kavanaugh\u2019s broad view of executive power expressed in his legal opinions and speeches. In a tweet on Monday, Trump criticized Attorney General Jeff Sessions for the recent indictments of two Republican congressmen, the latest in a string of criticisms the president has levied against both Sessions and the department he leads. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cIn this age of President Donald Trump, this expansive view of presidential power takes on added significance,\u201d said Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kavanaugh emphasized the importance of the separation of powers and an independent judiciary as a backstop. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cI\u2019ve made clear in my writings that a court order that requires a president to do something or prohibits president from doing something is the final word in our system,\u201d Kavanaugh said.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The exchange drew intense scrutiny online, and on Thursday, Sen. Orrin G.

Bush judicial candidate: Judge William Pryor, who now sits on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit. But emails made newly public early Thursday show more involvement than he appeared to indicate in his 2004 testimony. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Dec. 16, 2002, Kavanaugh received an email, reviewed by The Washington Post, from another White House aide with the subject line \u201cCA11\u201d \u2014 a reference to the 11th Circuit. The aide, Kyle Sampson, asked: \u201cHow did the Pryor interview go?\u201d Kavanaugh then responded: \u201cCall me.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Another email from June 5, 2003 reviewed by The Post showed Kavanaugh on an email chain with a handful of other officials, alerting them to a 4 p.m. conference call to \u201cdiscuss Pryor and coordinate plans and efforts.\u201d A separate email earlier that day, on which Kavanaugh was blind carbon copied, discussed a meeting that would be held the following day to \u201cdiscuss nominee Bill Pryor\u2019s hearing\u201d the following week. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kavanaugh was nominated by Bush on April 9, 2003, and his confirmation hearing was held June 11, 2003. He was confirmed in 2005. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 2004 during his confirmation hearing for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, Kavanaugh said several times under questioning by then-Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) that he had not been involved with Pryor\u2019s confirmation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cI am familiar generally with Mr. Pryor, but that was not one that I worked on personally,\u201d Kavanaugh testified then. Upon further questioning, Kavanaugh said \u201cI was not involved in handling his nomination.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Pryor drew controversy because he had called Roe v. Wade \u201cthe worst abomination of constitutional law in our history.\u201d As attorney general of Alabama, he had filed an amicus brief in a key Supreme Court case on gay rights, Lawrence v. Texas, that struck down state sodomy laws. Pryor wrote that states should \u201cremain free to protect the moral standards of their communities through legislation that prohibits homosexual sodomy.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), one of the swing votes on Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination to the Supreme Court, voted against Pryor\u2019s confirmation in 2005. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR White House spokesman Raj Shah did not immediately return a request for comment on the newly disclosed Pryor emails. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A spokesman for the Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), said some previously \u201ccommittee confidential\u201d documents are being made public as they are cleared by the Justice Department. Other records that have been requested to be made public are still being reviewed by DOJ and representatives for Bush.

Wade as the \u201csettled law of the land,\u201d according to a 2003 email made public Thursday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cI am not sure that all legal scholars refer to Roe as the settled law of the land at the Supreme Court level since Court can always overrule its precedent, and three current Justices on the Court would do so,\u201d Kavanaugh wrote after reviewing a draft of what was intended to be an op-ed in favor of a judicial nominee. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kavanaugh addressed the decision on Wednesday, refusing to say whether he believed that Roe v. Wade, the decision that guaranteed a woman\u2019s right to an abortion, was correctly decided. He also said the Supreme Court had affirmed it in subsequent cases. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Thursday, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) read aloud from Kavanaugh\u2019s newly released email and said it has \u201cbeen viewed as you saying you don\u2019t think Roe is settled\u201d and asked him to explain.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Supreme Court itself operates in a relatively anachronistic format, blocking cameras \u2014 and most other forms of technology \u2014 when cases are argued and announced. The question of whether it should remain that way has been raised over the years, including to nominees who went on to join the court. During Justice Neil M. Gorsuch\u2019s confirmation hearings last year, he said he was open to hearing more about the issue. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kavanaugh also said he was open to learning more, including from the justices already on the court to hear \u201cwhat they think about this.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cTo learn, if I were to be confirmed, from the experience there and to see what the experience there is like,\u201d he said. \u201cTo listen to the justices currently on the Supreme Court.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u2014 Mark Berman NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 10:38 a.m.: Questioning begins and is promptly interrupted by protesters NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An hour after the hearing got underway, Sen.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A protester shouting about health care and chanting \u201cSHAME\u201d was taken outside by police as Grassley began. Then, as Kavanaugh began to speak, a male protester quickly interrupted, standing on a chair and shouting, \u201cSave Democracy, save Roe!\u201d as he was hauled out of the committee room by the Capitol Police.

Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) said he is prepared to violate Senate rules and release confidential committee documents \u2014 and to risk the consequences. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Booker had questioned Kavanaugh Wednesday night about his use of the term \u201cnaked racial set-aside\u201d and said he would make public documents backing up that assertion. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cI openly invite and accept the consequences of releasing that email right now,\u201d Booker said. \u201cThe emails being withheld from the public have nothing to do with national security.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Under the committee\u2019s rules, Booker could be expelled from the Senate for releasing such records. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Tex.) angrily responded to Booker and referred to his potential aspirations for higher office, saying \u201crunning for president is no excuse for violating the rules of the Senate.\u201d Cornyn argued that \u201cthis is no different from the senator deciding to release classified information that is deemed classified.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 9:34 a.m.: Hearing gets underway NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nearly 12 hours after the first day of questioning wrapped up, Kavanaugh is back before the Senate Judiciary Committee for more questioning.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Before the hearing began, the committee\u2019s Republican members were seen gathered around committee Chairman Charles E.

Among other things to expect and watch for: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u2022 The battle over access to records from Kavanaugh\u2019s tenure in the Bush White House is sure to resurface, with Democrats asking the committee to release additional documents that have not been disclosed to the public. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) implied Wednesday that there is evidence in confidential Senate Judiciary Committee records that Kavanaugh in 2003 was privy to an email allegedly stolen by a former committee staffer. Kavanaugh said he never knowingly dealt with stolen records. Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) did not guarantee that those documents would become public this week, but said, \u201cwe\u2019ll try to get them.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u2022 More questions are likely about Kavanaugh\u2019s views on a host of pivotal issues, including guns, abortion, executive power, health care, affirmative action and more, as well as about his experiences on the bench and in the Bush White House. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u2022 Health care and the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act will continue to be a potent issue, particularly as a legal challenge to the law unfolds in a courtroom in Texas this week. The nominee says he can\u2019t assure senators that he would uphold the law\u2019s requirement that insurers cover people with preexisting conditions because doing so would compromise his judicial independence. Democrats say they will revisit the issue. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u2022 Loud, angry protests are likely to continue to punctuate the Senate debate about Kavanaugh\u2019s legal theory and judicial opinions. A phalanx of Capitol Police officers, dressed in dark blue and some with zip ties, have been a fixture against the back wall of the hearing room, poised to quietly haul out protesters. Capitol Police on Wednesday arrested and charged another 66 people with disorderly conduct for disrupting the hearings. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u2022 In one of the most confusing \u2014 and tense \u2014 exchanges Wednesday, Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) raised the prospect without offering evidence that Kavanaugh may have spoken about the Mueller investigation with somebody at Kasowitz, Benson and Torres, a law firm that has represented Trump. It\u2019s unclear whether Harris will revisit the issue again Thursday, but the exchange went viral and quickly became one of the most talked-about moments of the Kavanaugh hearings.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He avoided ceding ground on the most contentious issues, either by saying he wanted to keep \"three zip codes\" away from politics or by arguing that he could not comment on \"hypothetical\" cases that could come before him on the nation's top bench. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kavanaugh refused to say whether a sitting president must respond to a subpoena -- not an academic issue in the age of Trump. He declined to agree to Democratic calls for him to recuse himself from any cases related to the Russia investigation. And he would not say where he would come down on abortion, amid expectations among conservatives he would like to overturn Roe v. Wade. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Democrats did not walk away from a deeply divisive hearing with nothing. Top lawmakers showed vigor in cross examining Kavanaugh and by portraying him as Trump's man on the court and may have at least partly lived up to expectations of the party's fired up base for a show of backbone ahead of the mid-term elections. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After emerging largely unscathed after the final round of questions from senators that stretched late into Thursday evening, Kavanaugh could take comfort in passing his biggest test. If Republicans stick together he is almost certain to be confirmed while minority Democrats face their own challenge in keeping the votes of red state senators with tough re-election races in their column. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Booker's document fight NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Thursday's hearing featured another bitter showdown between Democrats who are furious at the failure of the White House to hand over tens of thousands of key documents on time or at all, and at restrictions on the public release of material that was made available. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR New Jersey Democrat Cory Booker said he was ready to risk expulsion from the Senate for making public documents pertinent Kavanaugh's time as a top White House aide to President George W. Bush, but the GOP mocked him for grandstanding ahead of a possible 2020 run -- saying it had already cleared the emails for release. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a striking political gambit, Booker, backed up by Democratic Sen. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, released emails -- which had been designated as \"committee confidential\" -- that reference Kavanaugh's position on racial profiling and thoughts on Roe v. Wade dating from his time as a White House official under Bush. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Booker, who as a potential 2020 presidential candidate had an incentive to make a splash in the hearing, said he took the action as an act of \"civil disobedience.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I understand the penalty comes with potential ousting from the Senate. ... I openly invite and accept the consequences of my team releasing that email right now,\" Booker said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This is about the closest I'll probably ever have in my life to an 'I am Spartacus' moment,\" he added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Republican Sen John Cornyn warned Booker that releasing documents marked \"committee confidential\" would break Senate rules. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Running for president is not an excuse for violating the rules of the Senate,\" the Texas Republican said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Later Thursday, Bill Burck, a lawyer who oversaw the process of providing Bush administration documents, undercut Booker's grand gesture, saying that the material in question had been cleared on Wednesday night at the request of the senator's staff. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We were surprised to learn about Senator Booker's histrionics this morning because we had already told him he could use the documents publicly. In fact, we have said yes to every request made by the Senate Democrats to make documents public,\" Burck said in a statement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The office of Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, also said that senators, including Booker, were notified \"before they spoke today\" that the restrictions on the documents had been waived. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Booker, however, insisted he was in the right, saying he read from the documents aloud in the hearing on Wednesday night long before they were cleared at around 4 a.m. Democrats have repeatedly complained that the White House is withholding tens of thousands of documents relevant to the nomination and wants many more that have been provided released to the public. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The New Jersey senator also said he doubted Cornyn would follow through on his threats to enforce Senate discipline against him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I think he's like a lot of bullies are: a lot of talk, no action,\" Booker said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR North Carolina Republican Sen. Thom Tillis took exception to his Democratic colleague's tactics. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Certainly in the six hours between the time that email hit your email box and the theatrics that happened in this chamber today you could have actually found out that you didn't have to be Spartacus, you didn't have to go interact with civil disobedience, you got what you wanted,\" Tillis said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The schoolyard taunts underlined how the hearing, ahead of what appears to be Kavanaugh's likely confirmation, has become another battlefield in the vicious partisanship and complete lack of trust between the parties that is wracking Washington at a critical moment of the Trump era NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Booker's intervention followed a set of glowing reviews from liberals for another potential 2020 Democratic presidential candidate on the Judiciary Committee, Sen. Kamala Harris of California, who late Wednesday night appeared to discomfort Kavanaugh with a series of questions designed to find out with whom he had discussed special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Harris returned to the question on Thursday evening, saying that she had been working on \"reliable information\" that Kavanaugh had a conversation about the probe with someone from Kasowitz Benson Torres, the law firm founded by Trump's personal attorney Marc Kasowitz. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kavanaugh had sidestepped the question on Wednesday, so Harris asked him again and he replied \"the answer's no.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Earlier, the firm said in a statement to CNN there had been no such discussions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Harris did not disclose the \"reliable information\" on which she based her questions.

Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court ruling that upheld the right to an abortion, was settled law of the land. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the internal White House email, obtained by CNN, Kavanaugh wrote: \"I am not sure that all legal scholars refer to Roe v. Wade as the settled law of the land at the Supreme Court level since Court can always overrule its precedent, and three current Justices on the Court would do so.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The point there is in the inferior court point,\" Kavanaugh wrote, responding to a draft op-ed that had been circulated for edits between lawmakers and White House staff. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The draft, meant to be submitted under the name of \"high-profile, pro-choice\" women in support of a Bush judicial nominee, had said that \"it is widely understood accepted by legal scholars across the board that Roe v. Wade and its progeny are the settled law of the land.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR During the confirmation hearing on Wednesday, Kavanaugh said: \"As a general proposition I understand the importance of the precedent set forth in Roe v. Wade.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump said during his campaign that he would appoint Supreme Court justices who would overturn Roe. In recent years, Supreme Court nominees have gotten through their confirmation hearings by refusing to say how they would rule on what they say is a hypothetical future case on the issue. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The New York Times first reported the email. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Throughout the contentious hearing, now in its third day, Kavanaugh has tried to give political questions -- especially those related to Trump and his potential legal woes -- a wide berth. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Wednesday he insisted that \"no one is above the law\" but declined to say whether a sitting president must respond to a subpoena. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Senate Democrats have suggested that Kavanaugh could be biased in favor of the President and worry that his views on the primacy of executive power could help Trump evade legal scrutiny. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Booker warned that given Trump's frequent attacks on the Justice Department there was a \"shadow over the independence of the judiciary\" and said it was understandable for some Americans to wonder whether a nominee picked by the President would owe loyalty to him or had been nominated to shield him from a criminal investigation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"My only loyalty is to the Constitution,\" Kavanaugh responded. \"I have made that clear, I am an independent judge.\" ||||| Tweet with a location NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He was pressed once again for his views on presidential power. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., sought a promise from Kavanaugh that he would be willing to serve as a check on the president who nominated him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Give us some reassurance about your commitment to the democratic institutions in this country, in the face of a president who seems prepared to cast them aside,\" Durbin said. \"Whether it's voter suppression, the role of the media \u2014 case after case, we hear this president willing to walk away from the rule of law in this country.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"No one is above the law,\" Kavanaugh replied. \"I've made clear in my writings that a court order that requires a president to do something or prohibits a president from doing something under the Constitution or laws of the United States is the final word in our system.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, complained that the Supreme Court had been unduly deferential to President Trump this summer when it upheld his travel ban, despite what she called the administration's \"obviously bogus\" justification. She pressed Kavanaugh on when the high court should question a president's national security claims. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"National security is not a blank check for the president,\" Kavanaugh said, pointing to a number of cases in which the court had overruled the administration. \"Even in the context of wartime, the courts are not silenced. Civil liberties are not silent.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kavanaugh told lawmakers he is so committed to judicial independence, he stopped voting in national elections after he became a judge. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., again asked Kavanaugh if he'd ever spoken with anyone at the law firm of Trump's personal attorney Marc Kasowitz about special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, renewing a line of questioning she'd opened Wednesday night. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The answer is no,\" Kavanaugh said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As he's done throughout the hearing, Kavanaugh declined to answer a series of questions from Harris about issues that might come before the high court, including abortion, same-sex marriage and immigration. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The White House issued a statement late Thursday praising Kavanaugh. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Through long hours and days of questioning, Judge Kavanaugh consistently reinforced his firm belief in the bedrock principles of judicial independence and the rule of law,\" deputy press secretary Raj Shah said in the statement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kavanaugh was asked repeatedly during the televised hearing about whether he would support opening the Supreme Court to TV cameras. He promised to keep an open mind, but said he would also want to consider the views of the eight current justices. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Thursday's session began with Democrats on the committee in open revolt over the handling of documents from Kavanaugh's tenure in the George W. Bush White House. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some documents have been withheld altogether. Others have been provided to the committee on \"confidential\" terms, meaning senators can see them but they can't be made public. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Democrats object that the confidential label has been applied to a wide swath of records, many of which contain no personal or sensitive information. They also complain that classification decisions were made by former President Bush's attorney, William Burck, a former deputy of Kavanaugh's. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., released some of the confidential documents Thursday morning. Hirono also released \"confidential\" documents, drawing a stern rebuke from Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, who called them \"irresponsible and outrageous.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This is no different from the senator deciding to release classified information,\" Cornyn said Thursday morning. \"No senator deserves to sit on this committee, or serve in the Senate, in my view, if they decide to be a law unto themselves and willingly flout the rules of the Senate and the determination of confidentiality and classification.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Read the documents released by Sen. Hirono here and the documents released by Sen. Leahy here. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For all the theatrics on both sides, the debate over documents fizzled by Thursday afternoon, once it became clear their release had been authorized by Bush's attorney overnight. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We cleared the documents last night shortly after Senator Booker's staff asked us to,\" Burck said in a statement. \"In fact, we have said yes to every request made by the Senate Democrats to make documents public.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And an aide to Grassley told NPR that \"counsels for the senators who requested waivers last night/this morning for particular documents were notified that their requests had been honored beginning at around 3:50 this morning.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But a spokesperson for Hirono said the senator was not informed that the documents released by her office Thursday morning had been approved to be made public. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It is not clear whether Booker knew the documents he released had already been approved before his statements Thursday morning at the beginning of the hearing \u2014 when he said that his decision to release the documents was a form of civil disobedience and that he was aware he was risking expulsion from the Senate for making the documents public. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Cory said this morning that he was releasing committee confidential documents, and that's exactly what he's done,\" Booker spokeswoman Kristin Lynch said in an email to NPR. \"Last night, he was admonished by Republicans for breaking the rules when he read from committee confidential documents. Cory and Senate Democrats were able to shame the committee into agreeing to make last night's documents publicly available, and Cory publicly released those documents as well as other committee confidential documents today. And he'll keep releasing them because Republicans are hiding Brett Kavanaugh's record from the American people.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Enlarge this image toggle caption Jacquelyn Martin/AP Jacquelyn Martin/AP NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The documents released by Booker include a batch of emails concerning racial profiling, affirmative action and other race-conscious government programs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a 2002 email, Kavanaugh wrote that security procedures adopted in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks should ultimately be race-neutral, though he acknowledged that developing such procedures could take time. Others in the White House suggested racial profiling might be legally justified if it enhanced security. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a 2001 email, Kavanaugh addressed a legal challenge to an affirmative action program within the Department of Transportation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The fundamental problem in this case is that these DOT regulations use a lot of legalisms and disguises to mask what in reality is a naked racial set-aside,\" he wrote. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kavanaugh had sidestepped questions from Booker on Wednesday night about the circumstances in which government can and cannot use race-conscious measures to address past discrimination. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He conceded that hopes he expressed nearly two decades ago for a color-blind society have not been fulfilled. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We see on an all-too-common basis that racism still exists in the United States of America,\" Kavanaugh said. \"Our long march to racial equality is not over.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Separately, The New York Times reported on leaked emails from the \"confidential\" file. One is an email drafted by Kavanaugh in 2003, in which he questioned whether the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion should be described as \"settled law of the land.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Pressed on that email by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., on Thursday, Kavanaugh explained he was simply summarizing views of legal scholars and not offering his own view. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Wednesday, Kavanaugh said he understands the weight that many people attach to Roe. But he declined to say whether that case was properly decided. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Throughout the hearing, Kavanaugh has avoided commenting on Trump's behavior, despite urging from Senate Democrats. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I'm not going to get within three zip codes of a political controversy,\" he said Thursday, when Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., asked him about Trump's attacks on judges, including Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I've spoken about my respect and appreciation for the eight justices on the Supreme Court,\" Kavanaugh said. \"I know they're all dedicated public servants who have given a great deal to this country.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Barring surprises, Kavanaugh appears likely to win confirmation in time to take his place alongside those eight justices when the Supreme Court begins its fall term next month.

        "summary": "\u2013 Day three of the Brett Kavanaugh confirmation hearing has opened with a bang: Democratic Sen. Cory Booker says he has ordered his staff to release a Kavanaugh email even though it's supposed to remain under wraps. It's not clear yet what the email says, but NBC News reports that it concerns racial profiling. Booker called his act one of civil disobedience, reports NPR. \"I openly invite and accept the consequences,\" he said, per CNN. \"The penalty comes with potential ousting from the Senate.\" Indeed, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn read aloud rules stating that a senator who divulges \"the secret or confidential business\" of the Senate faces expulsion, reports the Washington Post. \"Bring the charges,\" said Booker. \"All of us are ready to face that rule,\" added fellow Democrat Richard Blumenthal. Democrats have been chafing that too many of Kavanaugh's documents are either being withheld or deemed off limits for the hearing. Booker's stand comes after the New York Times obtained some of those off-limits emails. In one from 2003, when Kavanaugh was working in the White House of George W. Bush, he objects to language that Roe v. Wade is \"settled law.\" He was going over a draft opinion stating that \"it is widely accepted by legal scholars across the board that Roe v. Wade and its progeny are the settled law of the land,\" but he took exception to the phrase. \"I am not sure that all legal scholars refer to Roe as the settled law of the land at the Supreme Court level since Court can always overrule its precedent, and three current Justices on the Court would do so,\" he wrote at the time. As the Times notes, Kavanaugh didn't state his personal opinion on the matter.\n"

        "document": "The number of donors who raise big money for President Barack Obama jumped in the last three months as he builds a war chest for what will likely be the costliest presidential election ever. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At least 41 people have raised at least half a million dollars for the president, compared to 27 in Obama's first report, according to an analysis of campaign data released Friday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The big donors, known as \"bundlers,\" are typically well-connected people who pledge to gather tens of thousands of dollars for a candidate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Former Goldman Sachs executive Jon Corzine and Dreamworks Animation chief executive executive Jeffrey Katzenberg are on Obama's elite list and raised $500,000 or more. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The president's campaign finance report shows he can still pull in major cash despite a stagnant economy, dipping approval ratings and grumblings among some liberal supporters that he has not done enough for their cause. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While still keeping ties to his famed small donor operation, Obama is relying heavily on major donors early on to finance a campaign that is likely to break records in spending, according to Anthony Corrado, a campaign finance expert at Colby College in Maine. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The emphasis has been on doing larger dollar fundraising events particularly asking for $2,500,\" Corrado said. \"Events like this help him to raise substantial amounts of money for the campaign allowing him to exceed his pace for 2007.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR GOP ahead in polls NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Obama and the Democratic National Committee have raised more than $150 million so far for his bid for a second term, far outstripping Obama's Republican rivals. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But fundraising prowess doesn't guarantee victory for the incumbent, who is fighting for re-election amid a economic stagnation and high unemployment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Opinion polls show that Obama will have a tough time winning re-election next year. A Gallup poll released on Friday showed that U.S. registered voters, by 46 percent to 38 percent, are more likely to vote for an unnamed Republican presidential candidate than for Obama in 2012. Obama recently called himself the \"underdog\" in the race. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bundlers raised about a third of Obama's war chest so far. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Earlier on Friday, Republican Mitt Romney posted $14 million for the quarter, second to fellow Republican Texas Governor Rick Perry's $17 million. Obama's comparable fundraising figure for the three months was $43 million. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Obama voluntarily releases a list of bundlers. No other major candidate has done so. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The president regularly brings in more than $1 million in a single evening of fundraising, as supporters donate the legal maximum of $35,800 to his campaign and the Democratic party for the chance to have dinner and take a picture with the president. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR UBS executive Robert Wolf and hedge fund executive Orin Kramer are also big Obama fundraisers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'Doing well with small donors' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At least 40 percent of all the money raised by the Obama campaign and the Democratic National Committee last quarter came from those giving in increments of $200 or less. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Obama campaign has been touting its connections to mainstream Americans who send smaller checks, calling itself a grassroots effort. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"They are still doing well with small donors,\" said Darrell West, director of governance studies at the Brookings Institution, a thank tank. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The campaign said that in the third quarter about 600,000 people donated to the campaign. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Much has been made of dipping support among Wall Street for Obama. Some financial executives, including hedge fund managers, have complained about Obama's tax and financial regulation policies and his comments about the wealthy, at times calling them \"fat cats.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the second quarter, more Wall Street money did flow to Romney, who has deep ties there. Still, Obama boosted the number of bundlers with Wall Street ties in that period. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Republican candidates' reports, due Saturday, offer the first broad look at their financial health. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They are the first official tallies of donations and expenses for contenders Perry, Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann, former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman and businessman Herman Cain, who said he raised $2.8 million this quarter. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, had nearly $15 million on hand in addition to the roughly $14 million in contributions during the July-September period that he reported Friday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Perry, who briefly surged to the top of the Republican presidential field this summer, has roughly the same in the bank. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Not counting major support from Republican-leaning super political action committees, the virtual tie between Romney and Perry for cash on hand means the two have similar amounts to spend on ads and travel just months before heading into key primary states. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Perry is expected to dig into his campaign funds to buy TV ads to Romney's record on health care, abortion, gay rights and job creation. His campaign suggested this week that the moment for a barrage of attack ads was near. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Romney, the former governor of a predominantly Democratic state, has been attacked for his shifting positions on social issues that are held dear by conservative voters who dominate the Republican primary season. ||||| It is no secret that the relationship between President Obama and Wall Street has chilled. A striking measure of that is the latest campaign finance reports. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mitt Romney has raised far more money than Mr. Obama this year from the firms that have been among Wall Street\u2019s top sources of donations for the two candidates. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That gap underscores the growing alienation from Mr. Obama among many rank-and-file financial professionals and Mr. Romney\u2019s aggressive and successful efforts to woo them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The imbalance exists at large investment banks and hedge funds, private equity firms and commercial banks, according to a New York Times analysis of the firms that accounted for the most campaign contributions from the industry to Mr. Romney and Mr. Obama in 2008, based on data from the Federal Election Commission and the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It could widen as Mr. Obama, seeking to harness anger over growing income inequality, escalates his criticism of the industry, after a year spent trying to smooth ties bruised by efforts to impose tougher regulations. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Since this spring, Mr. Romney has raised $1.5 million from employees of firms like Morgan Stanley; Highbridge Capital Management, a hedge fund; and Blackstone, a private equity firm. Mr. Obama has raised just over $270,000 from firms that were among his leading sources of campaign cash in 2008. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Employees of Goldman Sachs, who in the 2008 campaign gave Mr. Obama over $1 million \u2014 more than donors from any other private employer in the country \u2014 have given him about $45,000 this year. Mr. Romney has raised about $350,000 from the firm\u2019s employees. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Those figures do not account for all Wall Street giving, nor for the full force of each candidate\u2019s robust network of Wall Street \u201cbundlers,\u201d wealthy individuals who raise money from friends, family members and business associates. And Mr. Obama continues to dominate Mr. Romney \u2014 and the rest of the Republican field \u2014 in overall fund-raising. He has raised close to $100 million so far this year for his campaign, three times more than Mr. Romney, as well as $65 million for the Democratic National Committee. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The gap in Wall Street giving to Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney underscores disenchantment with Mr. Obama in the industry and the challenges both candidates will face in grappling with public anger about the financial world. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For much of the last year, aides to Mr. Obama have sought to mollify Wall Street executives still bristling over the president\u2019s criticisms of their profits and bonuses, while defending the administration\u2019s program of tougher oversight and regulation as both necessary and beneficial to the industry in the long term. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But with Mr. Romney, a former Massachusetts governor who once ran the private equity firm Bain Capital, the candidate many in Mr. Obama\u2019s camp believe is his most likely Republican opponent next fall, Mr. Obama\u2019s campaign appears to sense an opportunity to harness public resentment over an industry that has largely thrived while the rest of the economy has not. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that Governor Romney has raised money off of his belief that Wall Street should be allowed to write its own rules again by repealing Wall Street reform,\u201d said Ben LaBolt, an Obama campaign spokesman. \u201cThe president put in place protections to ensure that the financial crisis is not repeated and that unacceptable risks aren\u2019t taken with Americans\u2019 life savings.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For his part, Mr. Romney is now pitching himself as the turnaround expert for an ailing national economy. He has personally wooed major Wall Street donors, successfully recruiting several senior financial executives poised to back Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey had he opted for a White House bid. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But anger at big banks \u2014 manifested by the growing Occupy Wall Street protests in New York City and elsewhere \u2014 is palpable enough that Mr. Romney must avoid being seen as a friend of an industry that many Americans blame for onerous bank fees and underwater mortgages.\n",

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Officers began searching just before 2 p.m. Wednesday for Jimmy Causey, an inmate at Lieber Correctional Institution, about 90 miles (149 km) southeast of Columbia, according to Sommer Sharpe, spokeswoman for the Department of Corrections. No other details have been released. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Causey, 46, has now escaped from two different prisons in a dozen years. He and another inmate, convicted murderer Johnny Brewer, escaped Broad River Correctional Institution in Columbia in 2005 by hiding in a trash truck. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The pair eluded authorities for three days before being apprehended at a motel along busy Interstate 95, not far from the prison from which Causey escaped on Wednesday. A pizza delivery driver told The Associated Press at the time she tipped off authorities when she recognized a customer as one of the two men being sought by authorities. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Both men were returned to prison. Brewer was found two years later, hanging from a bed sheet in his cell. Grilled by state lawmakers about how the escape happened, then-prisons director Jon Ozmint blamed budget cutbacks that had forced his department to cut 800 security positions, leaving some areas like the trash compactor and loading dock unmonitored by officers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The director also said the men had fashioned fake heads out of toilet paper and put them in their beds, fooling officers at a 7:15 a.m. prisoner count. After a 9:00 a.m. count came up short, officials did a roll call and realized the two were missing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Causey, 46, was sentenced to life in prison in 2004 after he was convicted of holding Columbia attorney Jack Swerling and his family at gunpoint in their home. He was first incarcerated in state prison in 1992 on charges including grand larceny, according to online records.

Authorities said 47-year-old Michael Allen Williamson stabbed a police officer during his escape from McCormick Correctional Institution in the western part of the state.

Residents near the Ridgeville, SC, prison have been urged to \"remain vigilant, keep vehicles and homes secured\" while the search continues. Causey, who first went to state prison for grand larceny in 1992, is serving a life sentence for kidnapping prominent Columbia attorney Jack Swerling and his wife and daughter, the Post and Courier reports. He held the lawyer\u2014who had represented him in previous cases\u2014at gunpoint and demanded money. During the trial, the court heard that Swerling had managed to get reduced sentences for Causey on two occasions in the 1990s, but Causey still held a grudge about having been sent to prison at all.\n"

Not only is she the person who was in charge of the group that wrongly targeted conservatives, she dishonestly testified that she didn\u2019t know about the targeting until 2012, when the inspector general found she knew as early as 2011. She\u2019s the person who told a conference call of reporters, \u201cI\u2019m not that good at math,\u201d even though she\u2019s a manager in an agency that\u2019s at bottom all about math. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What I think is even more politically and morally suspect \u2013 and has gotten very little attention -- Lerner actually presided over the bizarre, bumbling rollout of the story, by planting a question about the controversy with an attorney at an American Bar Association conference. According to Morgan Lewis tax lawyer Celia Roady, Lerner herself asked that Roady inquire about whether the IRS had targeted conservative groups. That led to Lerner\u2019s public apology \u2013 and the scandal swirling around the White House, which found itself surprised by the sudden disclosure. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The invaluable tax-policy expert David Cay Johnston called for Lerner\u2019s firing a week ago \u2013 and that was even before there was proof that she had set up the question at the ABA conference. ||||| Lois Lerner, the IRS staffer who is under fire for her role in the agency\u2019s targeting of conservative groups, has been placed on administrative leave, according to congressional aides. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She will still be paid while on leave, a congressional aide said, as required under civil service rules. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lerner, who heads an IRS division that oversees tax-exempt groups, first disclosed the extra scrutiny the agency gave to Tea Party groups almost two weeks ago when answering a planted question at a Washington legal conference. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Since then, lawmakers from across the political spectrum have said that they believe Lerner misled them and have called for her dismissal. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sen. Chuck Grassley (Iowa), a senior Republican on the Finance Committee, said in a Thursday statement that new acting IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel had asked Lerner to resign \u2014 and that Lerner was only placed on leave after she declined that request. Aides on Capitol Hill confirmed that Lerner had refused to resign. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In her first public appearance since the disclosure, Lerner on Wednesday invoked her Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination at a House Oversight hearing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ADVERTISEMENT NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The IRS announced in an internal memo circulated to the media that Ken Corbin will be taking over as the acting director of the tax-exempt organizations division. Corbin, a 25-year veteran at the IRS, has been deputy director in a division that processed millions of tax returns a year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lerner\u2019s move to administrative leave comes after President Obama pushed out acting IRS Commissioner Steven Miller over his role in the targeting. Werfel, formerly a senior official at the Office of Management and Budget, took over as acting commissioner on Wednesday.

Carl Levin (D-Mich.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.) on Thursday became the latest prominent lawmakers to call for Lerner to be removed, in a letter to Werfel made public shortly before news of Lerner\u2019s administrative leave broke.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cI have not done anything wrong. I have not broken any laws.

(April 23) AP NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Surgeons at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine announced Monday that they have performed the first total penis and scrotum transplant on an American military veteran. (Photo: Getty Images) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A U.S. serviceman severely injured several years ago in an IED blast in Afghanistan has received the world's first total penis and scrotum transplant, surgeons at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine announced Monday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The man, whose identity was not released, is recovering well and expected to regain both urinary and sexual function, Richard Redett, who led the transplant team, said at a Monday telephone news conference. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The patient did not receive testicles from his donor to avoid the ethical issues that might ensue if he later had children, said Damon Cooney, another transplant team member. The testicles would have contained sperm from the recently deceased donor. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The donor was not identified, nor was his cause of death, but in a statement, his family praised the sergeant\u2019s service to his country and noted the donor family includes a number of veterans. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cWe are so thankful to say that our loved one would be proud and honored to know he provided such a special gift to you,\u201d said the statement, read by Alexandra Glazier, president and CEO of New England Donor Services, which arranged for the donation. \u201cWe hope you can return to better health very soon and we continue to wish you a speedy recovery.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Two years ago, surgeons at Massachusetts General Hospital performed a more limited transplant on a penile cancer patient. That patient, Thomas Manning, continues to do well, though his sexual function hasn\u2019t fully recovered yet, said Curtis Cetrulo, who runs the reconstructive transplantation program at Massachusetts General. The hospital has yet to conduct another penile transplant, as it awaits funding and other logistical issues, he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There have also been several successful penile transplants in South Africa, as well as an unsuccessful one in China. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Johns Hopkins surgery, performed in a 14-hour procedure in late March, was the most extensive yet, involving more tissue than has been previously transplanted, the surgeons said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In addition to a large skin graft covering part of the sergeant\u2019s abdomen, penis and scrotum, surgeons connected three arteries, four veins and two nerves to provide blood flow and sensation to the donated tissue. His internal organs were not severely damaged by the blast. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Redett said he expects the patient will regain the ability to urinate by the time he leaves the hospital later this week. It will take about six months for the nerves to regrow enough to restore sexual function and sensation, but Redett said he is optimistic that will take place. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Johns Hopkins covered the cost of the procedure, and hopes to complete more in the near future, said W. P. Andrew Lee, who directs the hospital\u2019s Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The hospital does not plan to use the procedure for gender reassignment surgery, he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Once it becomes more routine, penile transplantation is likely to cost about the same as a liver transplant, said L. Scott Levin, chairman of orthopedic surgery and a professor of plastic surgery at Penn Medicine. (One recent estimate puts the total cost of a liver transplant in the United States above $800,000.) It is still an open question who will pay for such procedures, Levin said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Another major issue in transplantation is rejection. The recipient\u2019s body may reject the donated tissue at any time, so the Johns Hopkins patient will have to be on continuous therapy to tamp down his immune system, said Gerald Brandacher, who handled the immune aspects of the Johns Hopkins transplant. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To reduce the risk of rejection, the patient was also infused with bone marrow from the donor. This approach has been used in eight other patients who received transplants, such as arms, that were transformative but not lifesaving. Balancing the donor\u2019s bone marrow with the recipient\u2019s allows the patient to take only one low-dose medication a day instead of the three typically taken by transplant patients, Brandacher said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Injuries that affect sexual and urinary function can be devastating to a person\u2019s identity, self-esteem and intimate relationships, said Lee, whose department has been preparing for penile transplantations since 2013. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cWe believe that genital-urinary transplantation can help those warriors with missing genitalia, just as hand and arm transplants transformed the lives of amputees,\u201d he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At Massachusetts General, publicity surrounding the penile transplant encouraged other patients with genitourinary tissue damage to seek care. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cWe\u2019ve had many people who are really despondent come out of the shadows and get worked up,\u201d Cetrulo said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Even if they weren\u2019t transplant candidates they have now been helped in other ways, Cetrulo said, noting many people with these conditions consider suicide, and suffer even more emotional pain than people in need of arm or face transplants. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hopefully, the Johns Hopkins' patient will inspire others to seek help, Cetrulo said. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the most incredible and important contributions of this case, not only to this individual whose life has probably been saved.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2vDM2Nt ||||| WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A veteran who lost his genitals from a blast in Afghanistan has received the world's most extensive penis transplant, and doctors said Monday he is recovering well and expected to leave the hospital this week. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Saying they wanted to address \"an unspoken injury of war,\" Johns Hopkins University surgeons rebuilt the man's entire pelvic region \u2014 transplanting a penis, scrotum and part of the abdominal wall from a deceased donor \u2014 in a highly experimental 14-hour operation last month. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Such transplants \"can help those warriors with missing genitalia just as hand and arm transplant transformed the lives of amputees,\" Dr. W.P. Andrew Lee, Hopkins' chairman of plastic and reconstructive surgery, told reporters Monday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The patient, who asked to remain anonymous, is expected to recover urinary and, eventually, sexual function. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The scrotum transplant did not include the donor's testicles, meaning reproduction won't be possible. \"We just felt there were too many unanswered ethical questions\" with that extra step, said Hopkins' Dr. Damon Cooney. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Three other successful penis transplants have been reported, two in South Africa and one in 2016 at Massachusetts General Hospital. Those transplants involved only the penis, not extensive surrounding tissue that made this transplant much more complex. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The loss of a penis, whether from cancer, accident or war injury, is emotionally traumatic, affecting urination, sexual intimacy and the ability to conceive a child. Many patients suffer in silence because of the stigma their injuries sometimes carry. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Doctors sometimes reconstruct the form of a penis from a patient's own skin, usually to treat congenital abnormalities or during transgender surgery. That requires using implants to achieve erection. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For a functional penis transplant, surgeons must connect tiny nerves and blood vessels. Candidates face some serious risks, including rejection of the tissue and side effects from anti-rejection drugs that must be taken for life. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But penis transplants have generated intense interest among veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan, and a few years ago Hopkins surgeons began planning and rehearsing how to perform such a complex operation in patients with widespread tissue damage. The Department of Defense Trauma Registry has recorded 1,367 male service members who survived with genitourinary injuries between 2001 and 2013. It's not clear how many victims lost all or part of the penis. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hopkins is screening additional veterans to see if they are good candidates for this type of reconstructive transplant. Finding donors is an additional hurdle: In the U.S., people or their families who agree to donate organs such as the heart or lung must be asked separately about also donating a penis, hand, face or other body part. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Hopkins patient received an extra experimental step, an infusion of bone marrow from his donor that research suggests may help a recipient's immune system better tolerate a transplant. Surgeons said that is enabling the veteran to take one anti-rejection drug instead of several.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Enlarge this image toggle caption iStockphoto iStockphoto NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Starting Monday, same-sex marriage is legal in Hawaii. The state has long been a destination for weddings and honeymoons. And now state officials, as well as hotels and restaurants, are hoping the latest marriage-equality law will spur a new market for wedding tourism. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Wedding planner Keane Akao is showing off a secluded beach wedding site, one of several on the Hawaiian island of Oahu. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"You can use the beach for pictures,\" he tells a couple, \"and this is actually called Secret Beach.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR His company, Perfectly Planned Hawaii, offers wedding planning for same-sex couples. Swaying palm trees and clear blue water make for a dream ceremony. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Akao started his company with his business partner less than six months ago, just before Hawaii Gov. Neil Abercrombie called for a special session to debate same-sex marriage. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"People now can look at Hawaii as a destination to have their marriage done legally,\" says Akao, \"and for it to be recognized by the federal government, no matter what state they may live in.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He has received more than two-dozen confirmations since the bill passed last month. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One couple planning to marry in the islands is Cira Abiseid and Cyrilla Owle. Last month, they celebrated their union in a ceremony with family and friends at home in Conway, Ark. But their home state doesn't recognize same-sex marriage, so Owle says they're going to Hawaii to make it official. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I think there's two things that came in effect when planning where we wanted to be married,\" says Owle. \"First, like any couple, we wanted to see where we wanted to go for our honeymoon. So who doesn't want to go to Hawaii for their honeymoon, right? And the second reason was, where could we get a license?\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Same-sex couples will be attracted to Hawaii for the same reasons that opposite-sex couples are attracted to Hawaii,\" says Sumner La Croix, an economist at the University of Hawaii. \"It's the great weather, it's the warm water, it's the beautiful scenery. And it's also the aloha spirit.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR La Croix estimates that over the next three years, gay marriage will boost tourism in Hawaii by $217 million. Unlike some other states with marriage equality laws, Hawaii already has a booming tourism industry. La Croix believes that gives Hawaii an advantage. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The machinery of marriage is already in place here. There are hotels that are in the marriage business,\" he says. \"They're used to catering to couples who are honeymooning or want to get married or are celebrating a marriage. There are wedding photographers. There are caterers. There's a large number of firms that are specialized in the marriage business.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In Hawaii, tourism is a $14 billion industry. Now, the island chain is positioning itself for a spike in visitors \u2014 among them, Honolulu-based hotel chain Aqua Hospitality. It already offers LGBT travel deals, including the \"out and proud\" package and the \"civil unions romance special.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bigger beachfront resorts are also getting in on the action. The Sheraton Waikiki is the only hotel on Oahu providing on-site marriage licenses. General Manager Kelly Sanders says now the hotel is running a new ad campaign in mainland LGBT publications. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Yes, there's a revenue opportunity,\" says Sanders. \"There's an opportunity for all of us to really have that great success, but in my mind it's something that should have happened already. And so it's just now being able to really open all of our arms as wide as they can be and say welcome.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It was Hawaii that back in 1991 touched off the national conversation about same-sex marriage. Then, three couples sued to force the state to issue them marriage licenses. Now, more than two decades later, Hawaii is the latest state to recognize marriage equality. ||||| Six couples tied the knot early Monday, shortly after midnight, when a new law allowing same-sex couples to marry took effect. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A Waikiki resort was hosting mass ceremonies for anyone wanting to sign up, while a group of clergy who pushed for the new law planned to host a wedding for an openly gay Unitarian minister at a church near downtown Honolulu.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Couples can sign up for a license online, then be verified by any license agent throughout the state. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. Check back soon for further information. AP's earlier story is below. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The first couples are starting to take advantage of Hawaii's newfound aloha for gay weddings. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dozens of couples were expected to start tying the knot early Monday, moments after midnight, when a new law allowing same couples to marry takes effect in the state. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Couples at the Sheraton Waikiki began filling out license applications a few minutes after midnight, as license agents huddled around four laptops in a conference room adjacent to a 30th floor lounge where the ceremonies were set to take place. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Guests sipped champagne, dined on appetizers, listened to piano music and took pictures with each of seven cakes on display for the occasion, one for each of the first six couples getting married and a three-tiered centerpiece cake adorned with pink and white roses. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Next,\" exclaimed Ethan Wung after being the first of the group to complete the license application with his groom, Keola Akana. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Wung said he and Akana were getting married after entering into a civil union last year so they could receive federal benefits. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Organizers were waiting for each of the first six couples to finish their paperwork before starting the ceremony. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The resort was hosting mass ceremonies for anyone wanting to sign up, while a group of clergy who pushed for the new law planned to host a wedding for an openly gay Unitarian minister at a church near downtown Honolulu. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It's just exciting and historic and we wanted to be a part of it,\" Maria Gallo, a Honolulu resident who planned to marry her partner, Beth Creary, said earlier.

Agents have set up shop throughout the islands, from resorts on Maui and the Big Island to hard-to-reach places on Kauai. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For those wanting to get licenses in person, Hawaii's Health Department planned to open its doors at 8 a.m. local time Monday morning. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We started this battle 23 years ago and we get to finish it tonight,\" said Michael Golojuch Jr., chairman on Honolulu Pride and one of the organizers of the midnight weddings at the Sheraton. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hawaii is often credited with starting the national gay marriage discussion, when couples applying for a marriage license led to a court fight the eventually helped prompt Congress to pass the Defense of Marriage Act in 1996. Part of the law was struck down earlier this year by the U.S. Supreme Court. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Golojuch said the weddings will touch Hawaii in a good way and that businesses have begun to think about how to embrace the gay community. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"They opened up their doors to us, their hearts to us,\" Golojuch said. \"That's what we're seeing with a lot of the business community that understands that $217 million is what our economy needs to keep on going.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An estimate from a University of Hawaii researcher says Hawaii will get a $217 million tourism boost over the next three years as a result of gay marriage. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hawaii's Legislature _ overwhelmingly comprised of Democrats _ passed the law last month during a special session. Gov.

        "document": "NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hand Grips Clinically Proven Beneficial for Prevention of Low Back Injuries. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Don't let snow shovelling be a pain in your back. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Welcome to MOTUS. We manufacture hand grips that offer arthritis and back pain relief and reduce the risk of repetitive strain injuries including Carpal Tunnel Syndrome and tendinitis. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Motus grips are a snow shovel accessory that make snow shovels easier to work with. Use the D-grip and the T-grip on shovels, scoops, pushers and roof rakes. The ergonomic design adjusts to any stature, short or tall, left or right-handed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The D-grip mounts mid-way down the handle and gives lifting leverage to the forward hand. The T-grip mounts at the upper end of the handle and gives pushing and pulling control to the back hand. In combination, they optimize their mechanical advantage. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There are two main actions that take place when working with snow shovels: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lifting is involved in the use of snow and scoop shovels. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Biomechanically, lifting involves the body as a third class lever. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Adding the D-grip mid-way down the shovel handle moves the fulcrum to the lower hand, transferring the effort to the long end of the shovel, making it a first class lever. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With increased leverage, the user may now lift a heavier load with greater ease. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Pushing & Pulling is involved in the use of snow pushers and roof rakes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Adding the D-grip mid-way down the handle improves posture by allowing the user to stand taller with less back bend. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Limb alignment and hand position with the D-grip are more neutral, reducing the risk of repetitive stress injury. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Neutral limb alignment and hand position also reduce fatigue and blisters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Adding the T-grip handle at the upper end allows a greater range of motion. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A straight line of force from the shoulder to the grip opens the space between the shoulders for good posture and reduced risk of back and muscle strain. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Neutral limb alignment and hand position help reduce arthritis and back pain. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A Case Study Assessment of MOTUS Power-Grip Products NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR by Dean Kriellaars, Ph.D., NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR University of Manitoba, School of Medical Rehabilitation NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR May 20, 1992 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I. Description NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Straight Grip (T-grip) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The straight grip provides a fixed hand placement at right angle to the implement shaft. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR D-ring Handle (D-grip) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The d-ring handle provides a hand placement site, which is slightly displaced from the implement shaft. The d-ring can be positioned at any angle relative to the shaft but is typically positioned close to a right angle to the shaft. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR II. Method NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A pseudo-static, biomechanical assessment of the straight grip Power-Grip product was undertaken in case study fashion for a simple shoveling task. The Newtonian equations for static equilibrium were developed to estimate the trunk joint moment required to hold a load with and without the straight hand-grip. A dynamic and EMG analysis was not undertaken. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR III. Results for the Straight Grip NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A. This hand-grip permits the wrist angle to remain in a near neutral position in the ulnar/radial plane. The amount of ulnar deviation is limited to a maximum of 10 degrees as compared to 35 degrees (near the end of range of motion) without the use of the straight grip. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In lifting with an implement, the wrist can undergo maximum ulnar deviation during a specific period. This results in compression of the tissues located on the ulnar side of the wrist (the ulnar nerve, blood supply, carpal ligaments, tendons, etc.) and tension in the radially located tissues. Prolonged or repetitive loading of a joint at the end of range of motion can be deleterious to the tissues. In the mid-range of a joint, the muscles can operate efficiently to bear the load, however, in the end of range of motion, the passive tissues bear a disproportionate amount of the load since the muscles are in a compromised position. The decreased ulnar deviation resulting from the use of the straight grip is beneficial to the structures in and about the wrist. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR B. The hand-grip requires the forearm to be in a pronated position. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Without the use of the straight grip, the forearm would be in a supinated position. This positioning influences the set of muscles recruited to perform the task. Most notably, with the forearm in a supinated position, the biceps brachii can operate to control the amount of supination and is in an advantaged position to aid in elbow flexion. When the straight grip is used, the forearm is positioned in pronation. This positioning results in a different muscle strategy to be employed during the lifting task. The biceps brachii is positioned in a relatively lengthened position and the forearm extensors and forearm supinators are required to control the degree of pronation. The difference in lifting with the straight grip represents a substitution of muscles required to perform the task. An electromyographical analysis would be required to establish the precise muscle activation pattern. This may limit the amount of elbow flexion used to perform the task enabling the user to incorporate larger trunk and lower limb musculature. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR C. The change in wrist position and forearm pronation results in an increased shoulder abduction angle (5-10 degrees). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The change in wrist position requires the shoulder to be abducted. The lifting task normally involves the use of shoulder abductors. When the straight grip is used the starting angle for the abduction movement is greater. The change in joint angle would alter the muscle activation pattern required to perform the task. It is possible to speculate that the supraspinatus muscle, which is claimed to account for the first 5 degrees of abduction, would not be involved in the abduction when the straight grip is employed, instead the larger deltoid muscles would be primarily involved. This may result in a decreased likelihood of tendinitis (or similar disorder) of the intrinsic shoulder muscles. This speculation would have to be examined with electromyographical analysis. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR D. The change in upper limb kinematics (joint angles) due to the hand-grip reduces the trunk flexion angle in the neighborhood of 5 degrees. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The kinematics of the upper limb holding on to the straight grip allows the trunk to remain in a more upright position during a lifting task. This results in a decreased effort from the extensor muscles of the hip and back since they do not have to work as hard to hold up the weight of the trunk. These muscles do not have to work as hard since there is i) a decrease in the moment of the weight of the upper body due to a decrease in the moment arm, and ii) a decrease in the moment of the weight of the load (that being lifted) due to a decrease in the moment arm are (the perpendicular distance from the line of action of the weight force acting vertically downward to the specific axis of rotation, say the L4 vertebral axis). This decrease in the moment of the load and upper body weight would be in the order of 5%. For repetitive tasks this small decrease would result in substantial energy savings and may result in less cumulative trauma. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR E. The change in upper body kinematics (joint angles) allows the load borne by the implement to be carried closer (about 5 cm) in the para-sagittal plane to the joint axes of rotation, most notable the hip and lumbar vertebral axes, as well as the upper limb axes (shoulder and elbow). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Similar to point D., when the lifted load is carried closer to the body this results in a decrease in the moment arm of the load relative to the body's axes of rotation (hip, lumbar, shoulder, etc.). The decrease in moment arm reduces the tendency of the load to rotate downward which proportionately relieves the muscles from having to rotate the load upward. The magnitude of this effect is between 3 and 5 %. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The overall reduction in load arising from the decrease in trunk angle and the closer load carrying is near 10%. This is a substantial amount, not only for repetitive tasks, but also for a single execution of a task. This would be beneficial for prevention and rehabilitation of low back injuries. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR F. The hand-grip did not result in an observable change in lower limb kinematics. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The method employed in this study did not permit accurate evaluation of lower limb kinematics. A video motion analysis would be required for this purpose. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR G. The hand-grip constrains the user to a specific set of lifting postures. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This constraint arises from the fact that the user must hold the grip and since the grip is fixed on the implement shaft the user's upper limbs are required to maintain a fixed geometry during lifting. Any task executed repetitively results in specific muscle fatigue, as such it may be beneficial to allow the user to rest or the freedom to adopt different postures to perform the same task which results in a substitution of non-fatigued muscles for the fatiguing muscles. This factor is primarily related to user understanding of proper lifting concepts and is not actually limited by the straight grip (i.e. changing the position of the straight grip periodically). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR H. The straight grip was found to fit any of the 14 different implements tested independent of: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 1. material (plastic, metal or wood), NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 2. shaft diameter NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 3. the presence of water (rain). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The straight grip was found to loosen or tighten somewhat with variations in temperature. The user would be advised to check that the grip is secure before each use. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I. The hand-grip reduces the potential for blister formation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The kinematics of lifting without the hand-grip involves movement of the hand relative to the shaft resulting in skin surface shear which leads to blistering. With the use of the straight grip the magnitude of skin surface shear may be less which would result in a decrease in blister formation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR CASE STUDY ASSESSMENT SUMMARY NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"hand-grip permits the wrist angle to remain in a near neutral position\"...\"beneficial to the structures in and about the wrist.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"enabling the user to incorporate larger trunk and lower limb musculature.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"decreased likelihood of tendinitis (or similar disorder) of the intrinsic shoulder muscles\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"remain in a more upright position during a lifting task\"...\"substantial energy savings and may result in less cumulative trauma.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The overall reduction in load arising from the decrease in trunk angle and the closer load carrying is near 10%.

Typically it's posed by a woman standing with hands on hips and assuming a Thurberesque mien as she gazes down on a man exercising his thumb on the remote but otherwise in repose. The correct answer: \"It might.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Snow-shovel design may not rank up there with the Three Gorges Dam as an engineering challenge, but it kills more than 10 times as many people each year. My Slate colleague Juliet Lapidos has observed that the 1,200 annual heart-failure deaths attributed to blizzards represent only about 0.3 percent of all annual deaths from heart disease. But that's a lot more people than die from watching a football game (though that poses health risks too). You can say all these shovelers should exercise more, and that's certainly true. But such advice is of little help to a sedentary soul whose doorstep is suddenly buried in a four-foot drift. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The science of shoveling was invented by the Progressive Era efficiency expert (and father of Taylorism) Frederick Winslow Taylor. Taylor observed laborers shoveling varying weights and concluded that the shovel load with which \"a first class man would do his biggest day's work\" was about 21 pounds. That's remarkably close to the current recommendation from Canada's Center for Occupational Health and Safety (keep per-shovel snow loads below 24 pounds). At the Bethlehem Steel works in Pennsylvania, Taylor gave out shovels specifically designed to hold 21 pounds\u2014small ones for shoveling iron ore, big ones for shoveling ash\u2014and made \"thousands of stop-watch observations\" to calculate the most efficient shoveling method. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Taylor's purpose was not to preserve workers' health but to maximize output; by following his recommendations, Bethlehem was able to increase the daily weight shoveled by each laborer from 16 to 59 tons. But because physical endurance was a necessary component to maximizing output, Taylor's shoveling method also reduced wear and tear on the human body. \"[T]his is not nigger driving,\" Taylor said (that's how Progressives talked in 1911); \"this is kindness; this is teaching; this is doing what I would like mighty well to have done to me if I were a boy trying to learn how to do something.\" He recommended that workers NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR press the forearm hard against the upper part of the right leg, just below the thigh \u2026 take the end of the shovel in your right hand and when you push the shovel into the pile, instead of using the muscular effort of your arms, which is tiresome, throw the weight on the body of the shovel \u2026 [T]hat pushes your shovel in the pile with hardly any exertion and without tiring the arms in the least. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Reading Taylor's recommendations, one is struck by two significant changes in American life. One is that 100 years later African-Americans are considered human beings whose physical well-being concerns society (at least in theory) as much as that of Caucasians. The other change is that, even taking into account that Taylor's subjects were all experienced manual laborers, people must have had much stronger backs back then.

How to avoid such a tragic fate? Well, for starters, keep your per-shovel load to 24 pounds or less. Beyond that, however, the recommendations get muddled, notes Timothy Noah on Slate: Shovels that make it easier to gather the snow make it harder to lift the snow, and vice versa. There is one obscure shovel supposedly better suited to both parts of the job, but good luck finding one in a hardware store. A few other things will lessen your risk: Don\u2019t start shoveling while snow is still falling (it\u2019s colder, so you\u2019ll put additional strain on your heart); don\u2019t bundle up too much (getting too hot isn\u2019t good, either); and don\u2019t drink coffee (it increases your heart rate) or hot cocoa (who knows why?) right before shoveling. If that all sounds like too much trouble, \u201cwait till someone younger or poorer than you knocks on your door and offers to shovel your walk for $20 or $30,\u201d Noah recommends. \u201cDelegate. The economy will benefit and your cardiologist will thank you.\u201d\n"

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Scientists and archaeologists are very excited about this because, what it does is, it corroborates our historical accounts,\" said National Geographic archaeology writer Kristin Romey, who was on site during the nine-month renovation project. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Experts believe the site was identified around A.D. 325 A.D., when the Roman emperor Constantine the Great came to the city with his team to locate places associated with the life of Jesus. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A holy fire ceremony is held at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem on April 15. Atef Safadi / EPA file NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Romans are said to have torn down a temple in Jerusalem where they found the cave that they believed to be his burial site. They then built a shrine and a church around that site. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Three different Christian denominations \u2014 Roman Catholic, Greek Orthodox and Armenian Orthodox \u2014 share custody over the church, and there have been turf wars and brawls in the past over the management of the site. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Even the restoration took decades to settle. In 1959, the various denominations agreed to conserve the edicule, but it took until 2016 to actually agree on a plan for the restoration, National Geographic archaeologist-in-residence Fredrik Hiebert said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The same Greek team that restored the Acropolis in Athens was chosen to carry out the project. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Archaeologists believe there may be more surprises to come at the site. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThere is so much information in the data that was collected by the restorers during the conservation project,\u201d Hiebert said. \u201cThere are many, many stories still to be told.\u201d ||||| Over the centuries, Jerusalem\u2019s Church of the Holy Sepulchre has suffered violent attacks, fires, and earthquakes. It was totally destroyed in 1009 and subsequently rebuilt, leading modern scholars to question whether it could possibly be the site identified as the burial place of Christ by a delegation sent from Rome some 17 centuries ago. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now the results of scientific tests provided to National Geographic appear to confirm that the remains of a limestone cave enshrined within the church are remnants of the tomb located by the ancient Romans. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mortar sampled from between the original limestone surface of the tomb and a marble slab that covers it has been dated to around A.D. 345. According to historical accounts, the tomb was discovered by the Romans and enshrined around 326. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR View Images A restorer removes debris beneath a broken marble slab to expose the original rock surface of what is considered the burial place of Jesus. Photograph by Oded Balilty, AP for National Geographic NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Until now, the earliest architectural evidence found in and around the tomb complex dated to the Crusader period, making it no older than 1,000 years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While it is archaeologically impossible to say that the tomb is the burial site of an individual Jew known as Jesus of Nazareth, who according to New Testament accounts was crucified in Jerusalem in 30 or 33, new dating results put the original construction of today's tomb complex securely in the time of Constantine, Rome's first Christian emperor. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The tomb was opened for the first time in centuries in October 2016, when the shrine that encloses the tomb, known as the Edicule, underwent a significant restoration by an interdisciplinary team from the National Technical University of Athens. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Several samples of mortar from different locations within the Edicule were taken at that time for dating, and the results were recently provided to National Geographic by Chief Scientific Supervisor Antonia Moropoulou, who directed the Edicule restoration project. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When Constantine's representatives arrived in Jerusalem around 325 to locate the tomb, they were allegedly pointed to a Roman temple built some 200 years earlier. The Roman temple was razed and excavations beneath it revealed a tomb hewn from a limestone cave. The top of the cave was sheared off to expose the interior of the tomb, and the Edicule was built around it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A feature of the tomb is a long shelf, or \"burial bed,\" which according to tradition was where the body of Jesus Christ was laid out following crucifixion. Such shelves and niches, hewn from limestone caves, are a common feature in tombs of wealthy 1st-century Jerusalem Jews. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The marble cladding that covers the \"burial bed\" is believed to have been installed in 1555 at the latest, and most likely was present since the mid-1300s, according to pilgrim accounts. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When the tomb was opened on the night of October 26, 2016, scientists were surprised by what they found beneath the marble cladding: an older, broken marble slab incised with a cross, resting directly atop the original limestone surface of the \"burial bed.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some researchers speculated that this older slab may have been laid down in the Crusader period, while others offered an earlier date, suggesting that it may have already been in place and broken when the church was destroyed in 1009. No one, however, was ready to claim that this might be the first physical evidence for the earliest Roman shrine on the site. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Is This Really The Tomb Of Christ? Scholars discuss whether the tomb of Christ is actually the tomb of Christ and how it would have looked. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The new test results, which reveal the lower slab was most likely mortared in place in the mid-fourth century under the orders of Emperor Constantine, come as a welcome surprise to those who study the history of the sacred monument. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Obviously that date is spot-on for whatever Constantine did,\" says archaeologist Martin Biddle, who published a seminal study on the history of the tomb in 1999. \"That's very remarkable.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR During their year-long restoration of the Edicule, the scientists were also able to determine that a significant amount of the burial cave remains enclosed within the walls of the shrine. Mortar samples taken from remains of the southern wall of the cave were dated to 335 and 1570, which provide additional evidence for construction works from the Roman period, as well as a documented 16th-century restoration. Mortar taken from the tomb entrance has been dated to the 11th century and is consistent with the reconstruction of the Edicule following its destruction in 1009. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It is interesting how [these] mortars not only provide evidence for the earliest shrine on the site, but also confirm the historical construction sequence of the Edicule,\" Moropoulou observes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The mortar samples were independently dated at two separate labs using optically stimulated luminescence (OSL), a technique that determines when quartz sediment was most recently exposed to light. The scientific results will be published by Moropoulou and her team in a forthcoming issue of the Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports.

        "summary": "\u2013 Millions of people flock to Jerusalem's Church of the Holy Sepulchre each year. Many believe it to house the tomb of Jesus Christ, though scientists have thus far been unable to date the tomb to the time when the Romans built a church around it. Now, however, a new series of tests \"corroborates our historical accounts\" as a National Geographic writer puts it to NBC News. It's easiest to understand the significance by understanding the history: Around AD 325, experts believe Roman Emperor Constantine the Great arrived in Jerusalem on the hunt for places linked to Jesus; his team identified the cave that they believed Jesus was buried in and built a shrine (known as the Edicule) to enclose the tomb and then a church around it. That church was destroyed in 1009, recounts National Geographic. It was rebuilt, and all archaeological dating coincided with that rebuilding\u2014proving it was at most about 1,000 years old. The tomb was opened for the first time in centuries in October 2016 to allow for the Edicule to be restored. A marble slab was discovered beneath marble cladding, and mortar samples taken from the slab dated to around AD 345. National Geographic's take: \"While it is archaeologically impossible to say that the tomb is the burial site of an individual Jew known as Jesus of Nazareth ...

(Photo: Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The deadliest fire in California history has set into motion the largest charitable collaboration ever among the nation's breweries, as more than 1,200 have signed on to brew a beer to raise funds for those affected by the Camp Fire in Northern California. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sierra Nevada Brewing Co., which is located in Chico, California, part of Butte County but west of the areas hardest hit by the fire, fed first responders and displaced residents during the fire and handed out clothing, too. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Ken Grossman, who founded the brewery in 1980, wanted to do more. He decided to brew a special beer, Resilience Butte County Proud IPA, and donate all the proceeds to the Sierra Nevada Camp Fire Relief Fund, which it seeded with a $100,000 donation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Then, Grossman asked other breweries across the U.S. to join in. \"We are working with malt, hop and yeast suppliers to provide raw ingredient donations to all participating breweries and are asking those breweries to donate 100 percent of their sales to the fund, as well,\" he said in the letter, a copy of which is posted online. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We know that the rebuilding process will take time, but we\u2019re in this for the long haul,\" Grossman said. \"Our hope is to get Resilience IPA in taprooms all over the country to create a solid start for our community\u2019s future.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR More: Paradise fire survivor: 'This was my home before, and I want it to be again' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR More: Colossal California wildfire finally contained; grim search for bodies continues NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Collaboration is common among independent brewers, and so is the brewing of charity beers. But the response to Sierra Nevada's Camp Fire initiative has been historic. \"I\u2019m quite sure that it\u2019s both the largest-ever collaboration and the biggest industry charity ever,\" said Garrett Oliver, brewmaster at Brooklyn Brewery. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So far, more than 1,000 breweries have pledged to make their own batches of Resilience Butte County Proud IPA. \"This is a great idea spearheaded by a great indie craft brewing pioneer supporting a great cause,\" said Sam Calagione, co-founder of Dogfish Head Craft Brewery in Milton, Delaware, which brewed its batch of Resilience IPA and plans to serve it in late December. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Our thoughts are with all of the brave folks who have helped navigate this challenging moment in Northern California and all of the families who have lost love ones,\" Calagione said. \"The craft brewing community has always been altruistic and mutually supportive, and giving back to our communities is one of the things we collectively do best.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dogfish Head Craft Brewery in Milton, Delaware, is one of about 1,000 breweries joining Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. in making Resilience Butte County IPA, the proceeds of which will support Camp Fire relief efforts. (Photo: Dogfish Head Craft Brewery) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Another of the participating breweries, Fort Collins, Colorado-headquartered New Belgium Brewing, recalls the hardship caused by the nearby 2012 High Park fire. The brewery's paperboard manufacturer, Graphic Packaging International, is located in Oroville, California, in Butte County. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cMany of their co-workers have tragically lost their homes, yet they\u2019re still coming to work every day. That is the definition of resilience, and we\u2019re happy to support recovery efforts in any way that we can,\" New Belgium Brewing CEO Steve Fechheimer said. New Belgium brewed its batch Tuesday and plans to make it available at its Fort Collins and Asheville tasting rooms in about two weeks. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"At New Belgium, we believe that business can be a force for good, and we think that ethos is shared throughout the craft beer community,\u201d Fechheimer said.

Sierra will can some of that beer and also make it available on draft. Other participating breweries will only sell Resilience IPA on draft, with most releases planned in late December and early January. Overall, the project should yield about 8.6 million pints of beer, the brewery estimates. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Breweries joining include small, midsize and regional breweries nationwide as well as Anheuser-Busch-owned Goose Island Beer Co. and Miller Coors-owned Blue Moon Brewing Co.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sierra Nevada's Grossman had hopes of sharing the beer's recipe with perhaps 500 breweries that would also make the beer and donate the proceeds. \"That was kind of his pie-in-the-sky goal; if we really work hard maybe we can hit 500 breweries, and we have doubled that number,\" brewery spokesperson Robin Gregory said. \"I know he wanted to raise at least seven figures, and it looks like, if our math is correct, it\u2019s going to be a bit higher than that.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Stone is proud to be participating in @SierraNevada\u2019s #ResilienceIPA charity efforts.

About 15 percent of Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. employees lost their homes in the fire, as did \"countless friends and family members as well,\" she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Even before the fire was officially extinguished, the brewery had set up the relief fund. \"Once the fire is out, we will distribute all donated money to partner organizations that are dedicated to rebuilding and supporting the communities that have been affected,\" Grossman said in a note on the brewery's website, also signed by daughter Sierra and son Brian. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The beer is a \"really classic\" West Coast-style India pale ale made with Centennial and Cascade hops, Gregory said. \"If it's going to be raising money to rebuild our community, we felt like it should be a taste of home.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The lobbyist, Sam Patten, 47, admitted that he failed to register in the U.S. as a foreign agent for his work lobbying on behalf of a Ukrainian political party. The nature of his cooperation isn\u2019t clear. Patten worked with Manafort and on Ukrainian campaigns, and reportedly worked on microtargeting operations with Cambridge Analytica. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mueller\u2019s office referred the prosecution to U.S. Attorney Jessie Liu in the District of Columbia, according William Miller, a spokesman for Liu, who declined to comment about the nature of the cooperation or other matters relating to an ongoing investigation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Patten appeared in federal court in Washington on Friday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Patten\u2019s plea agreement also included the suggestion that the Trump Inaugural Committee improperly accepted funds from a foreigner. Patten admitted that he illegally helped a Ukrainian oligarch buy a ticket to Trump\u2019s swearing-in through a straw-man donor, though as part of his cooperation agreement he wasn\u2019t charged. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A onetime State Department official under President George W. Bush, Patten headed the Moscow office of the International Republican Institute in the early 2000s. A Russian employee of IRI at the time, Konstantin Kilimnik, went on to work as a fixer for Manafort in Ukraine and is a business partner with Patten. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kilimnik has been indicted in absentia alongside Manafort on obstruction of justice charges. Manafort, who was one of President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign chairmen, was found guilty this month in Alexandria, Virginia, of tax and bank fraud charges and is being held in jail. He\u2019s due to stand trial in Washington next month on the obstruction charges as well as charges of money laundering and failure to register for his own lobbying work in Ukraine. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Manafort\u2019s Second Trial Looms, and There May Still Be Third NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Patten entered his plea before U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson, the same judge who\u2019s overseeing Manafort\u2019s money-laundering and obstruction of justice trial in Washington, scheduled to start next month. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Watching from the gallery was Andrew Weissmann, an expert on money laundering and complex fraud cases who will be the lead prosecutor in Manafort\u2019s trial in Washington. Also in attendance was Scott Claffee, a trial lawyer in the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR From 2014, Patten provided a \u201cprominent\u201d Ukrainian oligarch who isn\u2019t named in court papers and his Opposition Bloc political party with lobbying and consulting services, according to the criminal information. A company Patten co-owned with a Russian national received more than $1 million for the work, the U.S. said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Details about the Ukrainian oligarch match those of Sergei Lyovochkin, an Opposition Bloc leader whom prosecutors have previously identified as funding Manafort\u2019s work in Ukraine. He couldn\u2019t immediately been reached for comment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As part of his lobbying work, Patten violated the Foreign Agents Registration Act by not disclosing the work to the U.S., prosecutors said. No date has been set for his sentencing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cambridge Analytica NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Patten worked for multiple political parties and office-holders in Ukraine, according to his website. His work for Cambridge Analytica came during the 2014 election cycle, the Daily Beast reported in April. It was later adopted by \u201cat least one major U.S. presidential candidate,\u201d the Daily Beast said. Patten told the publication that his work for Cambridge Analytica was separate from the work of his consulting firm. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cambridge Analytica Files U.S. Bankruptcy After Data Scandal NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Patten formed a consulting firm in 2015 with Kilimnik, whom Mueller indicted in June. Kilimnik has been identified in filings as having worked for the Russian military\u2019s intelligence service known as the GRU. One filing cited an FBI assessment that his relations to the GRU continued through the 2016 election, which Kilimnik has denied. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The firm that the two set up, Begemot Ventures International Ltd., listed Patten and Kilimnik as the sole officers, according to its Washington, D.C., incorporation records.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Patten registered with Congress in 2016 to lobby for a group called the Committee to Destroy Isis, which was financed in part by a Jordanian construction company, according to disclosures filed with the Senate Office of Public Records. He disclosed payments of $50,000 and stopped lobbying for the group in July. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It\u2019s unclear why Mueller referred the case. Previously, he referred information about Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer Michael Cohen to the U.S. attorney in Manhattan.

        "document": "PERTH, Australia -- Search crews hunting for the missing Malaysia Airlines jet have failed to relocate faint sounds heard deep below the southern Indian Ocean that officials said were consistent with a plane's black boxes, the head of the search operation said Tuesday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Angus Houston, the retired Australian air chief marshal who is heading the search far off Australia's west coast, said sound locating equipment on board the Ocean Shield has picked up no trace of the signals since they were first heard late Saturday and early Sunday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Time may have already run out to find the devices, whose locator beacons have a battery life of about a month. Tuesday marks one month since the plane vanished. Once the beacons blink off, locating the black boxes in such deep water would be an immensely difficult, if not impossible, task. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Up to 14 planes and 14 ships are scouring the 30,000-square-mile search zone. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The wait has been devastating for weary families, CBS News correspondent Seth Doane reports. Many insist the search continues at all costs, despite the frustrations. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It is unclear whether a sub on board the Ocean Shield will be deployed to try to chart out any debris on the sea floor when searchers are certain the black boxes' locator beacons have gone silent. If the sub maps out a debris field, the crew will replace the sonar system with a camera unit to photograph any wreckage. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Houston's comments about deploying the sub contradicted an earlier statement from Australia's acting prime minister, Warren Truss, who said search crews would launch the Bluefin 21 autonomous sub on Tuesday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The towed pinger locator detected late Saturday and early Sunday two distinct, long-lasting sounds underwater that are consistent with the pings from an aircraft's \"black boxes\" - the flight data and cockpit voice recorders, Houston said, dubbing the find a promising lead in the month-long hunt for clues to the plane's fate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Still, officials warned it could take days to determine whether the sounds were connected to Flight 370, which vanished March 8 on a flight from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing with 239 on board. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This is an herculean task - it's over a very, very wide area, the water is extremely deep,\" Defense Minister David Johnston said. \"We have at least several days of intense action ahead of us.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Houtson said finding the sound again was critical to narrowing down the search area before the sub can be used. If the vehicle went down now with the sparse data collected so far, it would take \"many, many days\" for it to cover all the places the pings might have come from. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It's literally crawling at the bottom of the ocean, so it's going to take a long, long time,\" Houston said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Despite the excitement surrounding the Ocean Shield's sound detections, Houston warned that the search had previously been marred by false leads - such as ships detecting their own signals. Because of that, other ships cannot be sent in to help with the underwater search, as they may add unwanted noise. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We're very hopeful we will find further evidence that will confirm the aircraft is in that location,\" Houston said. \"There's still a little bit of doubt there, but I'm a lot more optimistic than I was one week ago.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Finding the black boxes is key to unraveling what happened to the Boeing 777, because they contain flight data and cockpit voice recordings that could explain why the plane veered so far off-course. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Everyone's anxious about the life of the batteries on the black box flight recorders,\" said Truss, who is acting prime minister while Tony Abbott is overseas. \"Sometimes they go on for many, many weeks longer than they're mandated to operate for - we hope that'll be the case in this instance. But clearly there is an aura of urgency about the investigation.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The first sound picked up by the equipment on board the Ocean Shield lasted two hours and 20 minutes before it was lost, Houston said. The ship then turned around and picked up a signal again - this time recording two distinct \"pinger returns\" that lasted 13 minutes. That would be consistent with transmissions from both the flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The black boxes normally emit a frequency of 37.5 kilohertz, and the signals picked up by the Ocean Shield were both 33.3 kilohertz, U.S. Navy Capt. Mark Matthews said. But the manufacturer indicated the frequency of black boxes can drift in older equipment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Houston said the frequency of the sounds heard was considered \"quite credible\" by the manufacturer, and noted that the frequency from the Air France jet that crashed several years ago was 34 kilohertz. Pressure from being so deep below the surface and the age of the batteries can also affect the transmission level, he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The frequency used by aircraft flight recorders was chosen because no other devices use it, and because nothing in the natural world mimics it, said William Waldock, a search-and-rescue expert who teaches accident investigation at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Prescott, Ariz. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But these signals are being detected by computer sweeps, and \"not so much a guy with headphones on listening to pings,\" said U.S. Navy spokesman Chris Johnson. So until the signals are fully analyzed, it's too early to say what they are, he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We'll hear lots of signals at different frequencies,\" he said. \"Marine mammals. Our own ship systems. Scientific equipment, fishing equipment, things like that. And then of course there are lots of ships operating in the area that are all radiating certain signals into the ocean.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Ocean Shield is dragging a ping locator at a depth of 1.9 miles. It is designed to detect signals at a range of 1.12 miles, meaning it would need to be almost on top of the recorders to detect them if they were on the ocean floor, which is about 2.8 miles deep. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Meanwhile, the search for any trace of the plane on the ocean's surface continued Tuesday. It is taking place 1,400 miles northwest of the Australian west coast city of Perth, with good weather predicted, said the Joint Agency Coordination Center, which is overseeing the operation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One-hundred-thirty-three missions have been completed so far in the hunt from the air for debris that could be from Flight 370, but no debris from the plane has been found. ||||| 1 of 7. A fast response craft from Australian Defence Vessel Ocean Shield tows Able Seaman Clearance Diver Michael Arnold as he searches the ocean for debris in the search zone in the southern Indian Ocean for the missing Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 in this picture released by the Australian Defence Force April 8, 2014. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR SYDNEY/PERTH, Australia (Reuters) - An Australian ship which picked up possible \"pings\" from the black box recorders of a missing Malaysia Airlines jetliner has been unable to detect any further signals and time is running out to narrow the massive search, officials said on Tuesday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Angus Houston, head of the Australian agency coordinating the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370, said the month-long hunt in the Indian Ocean was at a critical stage given the batteries in the black box beacons had already reached the end of their 30-day expected life. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A U.S. Navy \"towed pinger locator\" onboard Australia's Ocean Shield picked up two signals consistent with black box locator beacons over the weekend - the first for more than two hours and the second for about 13 minutes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Houston said the signals represented the best lead in the search yet, but efforts to pick up the pings again had so far been unsuccessful. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"If we don't get any further transmissions, we have a reasonably large search area of the bottom of the ocean to prosecute and that will take a long, long time. It's very slow, painstaking work,\" said Houston. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The black boxes record cockpit data and may provide answers about what happened to the plane, which was carrying 227 passengers and 12 crew when it vanished on March 8 and flew thousands of kilometers off its Kuala Lumpur-to-Beijing route. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Authorities say evidence, including the loss of communications, suggests the plane was deliberately diverted by someone familiar with the aircraft, but have not ruled out mechanical problems. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Analysis of satellite data led investigators to conclude the Boeing 777 came down in an area some 1,680 km (1,040 miles) northwest of Perth, near where possible pings were picked up and the search is now focused. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR BLUEFIN ON HOLD NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) named Bluefin-21 is onboard the Ocean Shield and could be sent to look for wreckage on the sea floor, but narrowing the search zone first was critical, Houston said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It is a large area for a small submersible that has a very narrow field of search, and of course, it is literally crawling along the bottom of the ocean,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"That's why it's so important to get another transmission and we need to continue until there's absolutely no chance the (black box) device is still transmitting.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Bluefin will scour the ocean floor in 20-hour missions using sonar in an attempt to find the aircraft, before its findings are downloaded and analyzed on board the Ocean Shield. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If anything unusual is spotted, the sonar on board the robotic vehicle will be replaced with a camera to take a closer look. The potential search area is about 4.5 km (2.8 miles) deep, the outer reach of the Bluefin's range. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some 133 missions have been completed so far in the multinational aerial hunt for debris in the southern Indian Ocean and would continue, officials said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Up to 11 military planes, three civilian planes and 14 ships planned to take part in the search on Tuesday, with good weather in the search area. But so far, searchers have only turned up fishing gear and other detritus. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Even after the black box is found, the surface search will continue because they're looking for evidence to investigate why the aircraft went down,\" Lieutenant Commander Adam Schantz, the officer in charge of U.S. Navy P-8 Poseidon search unit, told Reuters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"So, we'll continue for a while trying to find anything on the surface that might give a reasoning behind the accident.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (Additional reporting by Jane Wardell in Sydney and Anuradha Raghu in Kuala Lumpur; Editing by Dean Yates and Michael Perry)\n",
        "summary": "\u2013 When an Australian ship heard pings possibly from Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, officials saw a big lead open up in the search\u2014but since then, investigators haven't been able to recapture the signal, Reuters reports. That's particularly worrying since the batteries on the jet's black boxes have likely just about run out. But \"we need to continue (searching) for several days right up to the point at which there's absolutely no doubt that the batteries will have expired,\" says Angus Houston, the Australian official leading the search, per CBS News. \"If we don't get any further transmissions, we have a reasonably large search area of the bottom of the ocean to prosecute and that will take a long, long time,\" Houston says. The ship is carrying an autonomous underwater vehicle that can search the depths for the plane, \"literally crawling along the bottom of the ocean,\" Houston notes. Trouble is, findings so far point to \"a large area for a small submersible that has a very narrow field of search.\" Once the vehicle, called Bluefin-21, does head downward, it will conduct 20-hour sonar missions to try to find the plane.\n"

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dear City Council Members and Palo Alto Residents, NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This letter serves as my official resignation from the Planning and Transportation Commission. My family has decided to move to Santa Cruz. After many years of trying to make it work in Palo Alto, my husband and I cannot see a way to stay in Palo Alto and raise a family here. We rent our current home with another couple for $6200 a month; if we wanted to buy the same home and share it with children and not roommates, it would cost $2.7M and our monthly payment would be $12,177 a month in mortgage, taxes, and insurance. That\u2019s $146,127 per year \u2014 an entire professional\u2019s income before taxes. This is unaffordable even for an attorney and a software engineer. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It\u2019s clear that if professionals like me cannot raise a family here, then all of our teachers, first responders, and service workers are in dire straits. We already see openings at our police department that we can\u2019t fill and numerous teacher contracts that we can\u2019t renew because the cost of housing is astronomical not just in Palo Alto but many miles in each direction. I have repeatedly made recommendations to the Council to expand the housing supply in Palo Alto so that together with our neighboring cities who are already adding housing, we can start to make a dent in the jobs-housing imbalance that causes housing prices throughout the Bay Area to spiral out of control. Small steps like allowing 2 floors of housing instead of 1 in mixed use developments, enforcing minimum density requirements so that developers build apartments instead of penthouses, legalizing duplexes, easing restrictions on granny units, leveraging the residential parking permit program to experiment with housing for people who don\u2019t want or need two cars, and allowing single-use areas like the Stanford shopping center to add housing on top of shops (or offices), would go a long way in adding desperately needed housing units while maintaining the character of our neighborhoods and preserving historic structures throughout. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Time and again, I\u2019ve seen dozens of people come to both Commission meetings and Council meetings asking Council to make housing its top priority. The City Council received over 1000 signatures from Palo Alto residents asking for the same. In the annual Our Palo Alto survey, it is the top issue cited by residents. This Council has ignored the majority of residents and has charted a course for the next 15 years of this city\u2019s development which substantially continues the same job-housing imbalance this community has been suffering from for some time now: more offices, a nominal amount of housing which the Council is already laying the groundwork to tax out of existence, lip service to preserving retail that simply has no reason to keep serving the average Joe when the city is only affordable to Joe Millionaires. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Over the last 5 years I\u2019ve seen dozens of my friends leave Palo Alto and often leave the Bay Area entirely. I\u2019ve seen friends from other states get job offers here and then turn them down when they started to look at the price of housing. I struggle to think what Palo Alto will become and what it will represent when young families have no hope of ever putting down roots here, and meanwhile the community is engulfed with middle-aged jet-setting executives and investors who are hardly the sort to be personally volunteering for neighborhood block parties, earthquake preparedness responsibilities, or neighborhood watch. If things keep going as they are, yes, Palo Alto\u2019s streets will look just as they did decades ago, but its inhabitants, spirit, and sense of community will be unrecognizable. A once thriving city will turn into a hollowed out museum. We should take care to remember that Palo Alto is famous the world over for its residents\u2019 accomplishments, but none of those people would be able to live in Palo Alto were they starting out today. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sincerely, NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kate Downing NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR UPDATE: Thank you so much for the outpouring of interest and support. While we are leaving Palo Alto, the organization I co-founded that is working to invest in housing and transportation will continue on its work so that maybe in the future we can have a more inclusive community.

The loudest voices in the community feel that the desire to create more affordable housing is spoiled entitlement.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As one of the founding members of the citizens group Palo Alto Forward and a member of the city's Planning and Transportation Commission, she also has been a vehement critic of the city's recent tilt toward slow-growth policies, and its failure to address a housing shortage that many in the community and some on the City Council believe has reached a crisis level. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kate Downing Kate Downing NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Time and again, I've seen dozens of people come to both Commission meetings and Council meetings asking Council to make housing its top priority,\" Downing wrote. \"The City Council received over 1,000 signatures from Palo Alto residents asking for the same.

For several years, they have been renting a home in the Ventura neighborhood. Now, they are preparing to move to Santa Cruz. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In her resignation letter, Downing wrote that \"After many years of trying to make it work in Palo Alto, my husband and I cannot see a way to stay in Palo Alto and raise a family here.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We rent our current home with another couple for $6,200 a month; if we wanted to buy the same home and share it with children and not roommates, it would cost $2.7M and our monthly payment would be $12,177 a month in mortgage, taxes and insurance,\" Downing wrote. \"That's $146,127 per year -- an entire professional's income before taxes. This is unaffordable even for an attorney and a software engineer.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Downing also noted that over the last five years, she'd seen dozens of her friends leave Palo Alto and, in some cases, the Bay Area. She also said that she has seen friends from other states get job offers in Palo Alto and then turn them down whey they started to look at the price of housing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I struggle to think what Palo Alto will become and what it will represent when young families have no hope of ever putting down roots here, and meanwhile the community is engulfed with middle-aged jet-setting executives and investors who are hardly the sort to be personally volunteering for neighborhood block parties, earthquake preparedness responsibilities, or neighborhood watch,\" Downing wrote. \"If things keep going as they are, yes, Palo Alto's streets will look just as they did decades ago, but its inhabitants, spirit, and sense of community will be unrecognizable.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Downing is hardly alone in urging the council to act with more urgency on promoting affordable housing. In March, more than 1,000 residents, including numerous former mayors and planning commissioners, signed a petition spearheaded by Palo Alto Forward that urged the council to do more to address this topic. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The cost of living in Palo Alto has skyrocketed. As a result, we are seeing long-time neighbors move because they can no longer afford the rent,\" the petition stated. \"It is not unusual for Palo Alto workers to commute in from areas as far as Stockton, Gilroy and Tracy, putting severe strain on our roads and our climate. We are on the path to being a city composed only of long-time landowners and wealthy newcomers. This situation is the result of city policies that have discouraged new housing while encouraging more office space.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Recent surveys also suggest that residents are growing increasingly anxious about getting priced out of Palo Alto. In the city's annual survey, the number of people who gave Palo Alto good grades for \"variety of housing options\u201d dropped from 27 percent in 2014 to 20 percent in 2015, while the percentage of people who ranked the city as a good or excellent place to retire dropped from 60 percent to 52 percent between 2014 and 2015 (in 2006, it was 68 percent). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Local concerns about housing were also highlighted in a poll that the city commissioned last spring, when it was considering whether to proceed with a business tax to address traffic congestion. The poll showed 76 percent of the respondents listing \"cost of housing\" as an \"extremely serious\" or \"very serious\" problem, a higher percentage than any other issue (the drought and traffic congestion scored second and third, with 65 percent and 53 percent, respectively). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Downing's letter comes at a particularly sensitive time for local politics. The city is about to hold its first City Council election since the slow-growth \"residentialist\" camp won the council majority in 2014 and four of the council's nine seats will be up for grabs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Several candidates jumping into the race, including current planning commission Chair Adrian Fine, Human Relations Commission Chair Greer Stone and technology executive Michelle Kraus (all of whom are renters) have vowed to make creation of more housing options a priority if elected.

You work in tech. You've got it made. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Not if you want to buy a house in Silicon Valley. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Wednesday, a planning commissioner here became the very public voice of the region's frustrations over spiraling housing costs when she published her resignation letter to the city of Palo Alto. It said that she and her husband are moving to Santa Cruz because -- even with their combined incomes as a tech lawyer and software engineer -- they can't afford to live in this upscale city. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After five years of \"trying to make it work in Palo Alto, my husband and I cannot see a way to stay in Palo Alto and raise a family here,\" Planning and Transportation Commissioner Kate Downing wrote in her public resignation letter. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The letter makes personal what the numbers show: That rising rents and home prices of recent years have put the region beyond the reach of many, even some at the top of the heap -- including in the lucrative tech industry that fuels the rush for housing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The average rent in Palo Alto was $3,463 in the second quarter of 2016, according to a report last month from Novato-based RealFacts. In June, the median price of a single-family home was $1.2 million in San Mateo County and $982,500 in Santa Clara County, according to the CoreLogic real estate information service. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Downing, 31, has a full-time job as senior corporate counsel to a tech company in Santa Clara. In an interview, she explained that her letter \"is not supposed to be a sad story about me. I'm going to land on my feet. I'm extraordinarily lucky and privileged. I'm going to be fine.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rather, she characterized the letter as a warning call about economic trends and failed policies that are hurting Palo Alto and the region. \"It's clear,\" she wrote, \"that if professionals like me cannot raise a family here, then all of our teachers, first responders and service workers are in dire straits.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Downing and her engineer husband, Steve Downing, 33, share a 2,300-square-foot, four-bedroom house in Palo Alto's Ventura neighborhood with another couple. The monthly rent is $6,200. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"That's actually pretty cheap for here,\" she said in the interview. \"We probably pay on the low end of what they could get for our home.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Her letter calculated that if the couple \"wanted to buy the same home and share it with children and not roommates, it would cost $2.7 million, and our monthly payment would be $12,177 a month in mortgage, taxes and insurance. That's $146,127 per year -- an entire professional's income before taxes. This is unaffordable even for an attorney and a software engineer.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Downings based those numbers on putting 20 percent down: \"If you put down less than that, you're not going to get picked,\" she said. \"Everyone knows how competitive it is in Palo Alto, with multiple offers on every house. Some of them are putting down all cash. They're coming in with just gigantic deposits.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Downing's letter, a colleague said, is a timely commentary on Palo Alto's changing demographics: \"All of us who are in our 20s and 30 and 40s -- we're used to seeing people leave,\" said Elaine Uang, a co-founder with Downing of the community group Palo Alto Forward. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"You never know when your friends are going to go because there aren't the right housing options here for them to pursue the next stage of life.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A commissioner since November 2014, Downing said in the letter that the city has failed to move the dial on housing. Stating that her own recommendations to the City Council have gone nowhere, she outlined some of the ways in which the housing supply might be expanded in order to \"make a dent in the jobs-housing imbalance that causes housing prices throughout the Bay Area to spiral out of control.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She mentioned \"small steps like allowing two floors of housing instead of one in mixed-used developments,\" as well as legalizing duplexes, streamlining restrictions on granny units and \"enforcing minimum-density requirements\" so that developers will \"build apartments instead of penthouses.\" Housing should be allowed, she wrote, above shops and offices in single-use areas like the Stanford Shopping Center. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Kate does a good job summarizing the challenges we're facing as a community,\" said Councilman Cory Wolbach. \"To say that Palo Alto has been slow to add housing is a very accurate statement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"There's nothing shocking here,\" he added, in regard to Downing's letter. \"Palo Alto certainly does not encourage high-density, smaller, more reasonably priced units. It's unfortunate but true.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Palo Alto \"is not the family-oriented community it used to be,\" Downing said. In her estimation, it's becoming a place for \"jet-setting executives and investors\" who have neither the time or inclination to help out with block parties or join Neighborhood Watch. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Young people are not moving here anymore. It used to be a place of innovation, where people created art and sculpture in their backyards or started companies in their garages. Now, it's more for people who are CEOs and executive vice presidents.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Contact Richard Scheinin at 408-920-5069, read his stories at www.mercurynews.com/richard-scheinin and follow him at Twitter.com/RealEstateRag. ||||| In what\u2019s becoming a regular story in the Bay Area, many Peninsula towns\u2019 refusal to increase housing has led to a mass exit of long-time, working-class residents.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR These small cities, rich with tech money and close-proximity desirability, have left it to San Francisco, Oakland, and only a few other areas to house the influx of new-moneyed arrivals. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And with that, another noteworthy exodus has taken place: Palo Alto Planning and Transportation commissioner Kate Vershov Downing and her family have decided to leave the pricey town for Santa Cruz because they, like many other residents, can no longer afford the area.

This Council has ignored the majority of residents and has chartered a course for the next 15 years of this city\u2019s development which substantially continues the same job-housing imbalance this community has been suffering from for some time now: more offices, a nominal amount of housing which the Council is already laying the groundwork to tax out of existence, lip service to preserving retail that simply has no reason to keep serving the average Joe when the city is only affordable to Joe Millionaires.

Some issue stern pre-show warnings that anyone caught texting or talking will be shown the door. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It's not surprising then that the new chief executive and president of AMC Theaters, Adam M. Aron, caused a stir by suggesting that nation's second-largest movie theater company would consider the idea of making certain auditoriums \"more texting friendly\" in a bid to get millennials to go to the movies more often. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"When you tell a 22-year-old to turn off the phone, don't ruin the movie, they hear please cut off your left arm above the elbow,\" said Aron in an interview with Variety published online Wednesday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"You can't tell a 22-year-old to turn off their cellphone. That's not how they live,\" said Aron, who hailed from outside the movie business before taking the reins of parent company AMC Entertainment Holdings (AMC) in January. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR His suggestion that the company might revisit its stance on texting during shows didn't sit well with many movie buffs, who flooded AMC's social media accounts with objections. Some threatened to take their business elsewhere if AMC followed through with the idea. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The company quickly responded to the backlash with the following post: \"Press reports we are considering test allowing texts in a very few screens. We know vast majority of audience wants no texting. If ever, we only would pursue this in a way that we can be totally confident ALL our guests will fully enjoy the movie-going experience at AMC.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That still wasn't enough to quell critics on Twitter and Facebook. By Friday, AMC retreated with a company statement that included the following tweet: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NO TEXTING AT AMC. Won't happen. You spoke. We listened. Quickly, that idea has been sent to the cutting room floor. pic.twitter.com/JR0fo5megR \u2014 AMC Theatres (@AMCTheatres) April 15, 2016 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Aron, former CEO of Starwood Hotels & Resorts (HOT), is no doubt mulling new ways for AMC to woo an increasingly distracted and demanding audience. Rather than turn off their smartphones, many millennials would rather skip the theater altogether, or kick back at home and stream movies on their flat-screen TVs or mobile devices, via Netflix (NFLX) and other services. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 2015, America's 18- to 24-year olds represented 10 percent of the U.S. population and bought 14 percent of all movie tickets sold here, down from 16 percent in 2014, according to Stan Meyers, a Piper Jaffray & Co. analyst who covers media and entertainment companies. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Teens, somewhat surprisingly, are going to the movies more often these days, as are those in the 60-plus set, as measured by their percentage contributions to overall ticket sales between 2014 and 2015, said Meyers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"One of the things keeping millennials away from the movies is that they need to be on their phones all the time. What [Adam Aron] wants to do is segregate different groups so that people don't want to be on their phones, i.e., older demographic groups, and those who do could be in different [auditoriums],\" said Meyers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In his first few months as CEO, Aron has taken other steps to ensure that AMC, known as an innovator in the movie business, stays competitive in the face of demographic shifts and rapid technological change. In March, AMC announced that it has struck a deal to acquire Carmike Cinemas (CKEC), a merger that would create the world's largest chain of movie theaters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR AMC, a subsidiary of Chinese conglomerate Dalian Wanda Group, is also reportedly close to a deal with the Screening Room, a startup that will offer new releases in the home, via a set-top box that transmits movies, for $50 per view, according to Variety. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The venture is controversial within the movie business, but Variety reports that the Screening Room, backed by Sean Parker of Facebook (FB) and Napster fame, is seeking to pave its way by sharing its proceeds with distributors and providing customers with two free movie tickets per view, which would help boost concession sales for theater operators. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But it's the texting controversy that has put AMC in the hot seat in the eyes of some moviegoers. That is perhaps not surprising given that some people feel so strongly about the etiquette surrounding cell phone use in theaters that the issue has sparked violence. In early 2014 an argument between two men in a theater in Wesley Chapel, Florida, over texting ended in a fatal shooting. Before the argument erupted, the man who was eventually shot was sending text messages to his daughter during the previews to the movie. ||||| Tweet with a location NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

Learn more ||||| Adam Aron has been head of AMC Entertainment for less than four months, but in that short time he\u2019s already orchestrated one of the most significant deals in the country\u2019s history. In February, AMC announced that it has an agreement to buy Carmike, propelling it from being the second-biggest exhibitor in the country to the world\u2019s top movie theater chain. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Aron has a diverse resume, having been head of Starwood Hotels and Resorts, CEO and co-owner of the Philadelphia 76ers basketball team, chairman and CEO of Vail Resorts and president and CEO of Norwegian Cruise Line. But in an industry dominated by lifers, he is a newcomer to the exhibition space. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That\u2019s giving him a willingness to experiment. He\u2019s pushing to expand AMC\u2019s food options, bolster its loyalty program and market more aggressively. Some moves may ruffle feathers. In a bid to attract younger, smartphone savvy consumers, Aron said he was open to making some theaters texting and mobile device-friendly. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That may make him unpopular. When Regal Entertainment CEO Amy Miles mused in 2012 that theaters should consider experimenting with relaxing cellphone bans, the blowback was intense. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Related Movie Tickets in London Hit $50 - Here's What They Cost Around the World 'The Terror' Season 2 Adds George Takei as Series Regular, Consultant NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Aron sat down with Variety during CinemaCon, the annual exhibition trade show unfolding this week in Las Vegas, to discuss the planned merger with Carmike, ticketing advances and Screening Room, the controversial start-up that wants to debut movies in the home the same day they hit theaters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR You\u2019ve worked in a number of different industries, but you\u2019re new to exhibition. What perspective do you bring? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Coming in fresh, it seems like there\u2019s lots of opportunity to propel revenues or to give consumers better experiences. AMC has been a leader in that regard for a few years now, but I think we will pick up even more of a reputation for that going forward. Already, having been here a couple of months, I know we can step up our marketing activity in a big way. The food that we serve in our theaters can be much more exciting than the current stable of chicken tenders, hot dogs, pizza, in addition to the standard soda and popcorn and candy. A lot of change is possible in this industry for the betterment of our shareholders and our customers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Marketing costs money. Why do you think it\u2019s worth the expense? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Next year, assuming the Carmike acquisition is consummated, AMC is going to have in the neighborhood of $4 billion worth of revenue. It\u2019s almost irresponsible for a company with $4 billion worth of revenue on the line not to aggressively market. That\u2019s one of the things that can ensure that the $4 billion comes in, and that\u2019s one of the things that can ensure that more than $4 billion comes in. We wouldn\u2019t be spending for additional marketing if we didn\u2019t think we\u2019d be driving big revenue gains. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Are there particular demographics that you plan to target with your marketing? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR We ought to be looking at three things. People who are already interested in movies and maybe in a big way, where if we up our game, we could get them to come to more movies. That\u2019s one of the reasons to have a better loyalty program with bigger, broader participation, because loyalty programs work. We can convince people who think they are seeing the most movies they can possibly see to go to more movies. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The second is market share we can take from our competitors if we market AMC better than they market their theaters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And third, there does seem to be a consensus that there are pockets of consumers who do not see as many movies as other segments of the population and that we can be doing more to attract those people. Millennials come to mind. We need to reshape our product in some concrete ways so that millennials go to movie theaters with the same degree of intensity as baby boomers went to movie theaters throughout their lives. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Would appealing to millennials involve allowing texting or cellphone use? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Yes. When you tell a 22-year-old to turn off the phone, don\u2019t ruin the movie, they hear please cut off your left arm above the elbow. You can\u2019t tell a 22-year-old to turn off their cellphone. That\u2019s not how they live their life. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At the same time, though, we\u2019re going to have to figure out a way to do it that doesn\u2019t disturb today\u2019s audiences. There\u2019s a reason there are ads up there saying turn off your phone, because today\u2019s moviegoer doesn\u2019t want somebody sitting next to them texting or having their phone on. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Would you have a certain section for texting? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That\u2019s one possibility. What may be more likely is we take specific auditoriums and make them more texting friendly. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There are reports that you have signed a letter of intent to partner with Screening Room. What is your position on the company? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I\u2019m not commenting publicly on Screening Room. I know it\u2019s a topic of hot debate amongst my brethren and sister-en, and I prefer to keep our counsel private right now. Until such time as Screening Room is real, we don\u2019t have to spend a lot of time talking about it publicly. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR How open are you to different distribution strategies that might modify the theatrical window? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For all the talk of the Paramount test a year ago [Editor\u2019s note: AMC signed a deal that allowed the studio to debut two films on home entertainment early] and all the talk of Screening Room now, you may be surprised to hear that I think windows are very important. There\u2019s a lot of evidence that shorter windows put theatrical exhibitors at risk. Studios themselves benefit from posting big global box office numbers, which comes from theatrical distribution. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So I start from a general premise that I\u2019m a big fan of windows. Having said that, I\u2019m also a big fan of experimenting and testing on everything that we do to see if there aren\u2019t alternative ways of doing business. I generally look at our 385 theaters as laboratories where we can test lots of different concepts without being afraid that there\u2019s going to be a cataclysmic, sky\u2019s falling in, if we do. I believe in innovation and being imaginative and forward thinking. There are some bedrock principles though. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What are those bedrock principles? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I have two bedrock principles and only two bedrock principles. One is that it\u2019s our burden as managers of the company that runs movie theaters to make sure that the moviegoing experience is as wonderful and spectacular as it possibly can be. The surest way to grow our business and protect it against erosion is to make sure that going to an AMC theater is a pleasing and memorable experience. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The second is the consumer is king. Giving the consumer more choices, more amenities and price points. If we put ourselves in the head of our customer and design our theatrical experience and marketing activity to make their lives better, we\u2019ll have a successful company. Other than that we\u2019ll be flexible and willing to experiment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Where are you in terms of closing the Carmike acquisition? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There are really only two hurdles to go through. Carmike\u2019s shareholders have to vote to approve the transaction. I expect that\u2019s going to be some time in June. I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve set a date. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR We need to get through the Justice Department approval, but we\u2019re optimistic that we will get through both of these hurdles. The contract we have with Carmike requires that we get through this a year from the date of the merger transaction, so early in the first quarter of 2017. It would be nice if we could get it done before that. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What does the merger do for AMC? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By putting together the No. 2 and No. 4 players in the industry, we create a new No. 1 player. There\u2019s extraordinary amounts of research that say that No. 1 players in industries are often the most successful players in their industries. If that turns out to be true, I\u2019d rather be the No. 1 player than the No. 2 player. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Why did you recently sign a deal with ticketing app, Atom Tickets? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They\u2019ve got a great social media platform where when you buy a ticket for a Wednesday night at 7:00 show, it sends a text message to all your friends asking if they want to go to the theater and sit next to you. They click a couple of buttons and your friend can buy a ticket at the same theater and showtime in a reserved seat. That\u2019s a great concept and that\u2019s one of the ways that we can make it easier for Millennials \u2014 who live on social media \u2014 to meet up with their friends in movie theaters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Megan Fox delivered a pizza to your seat during Paramount\u2019s CinemaCon presentation this week. What was that experience like? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They took the pizza away as quickly as they delivered it. It was warm, and I could smell it, but we didn\u2019t get to eat it. I can\u2019t tell you how it tasted, but in terms of who and how it was delivered, I can tell you that\u2019s the best pizza delivery I\u2019ve ever had. ||||| Benvido \u00e1 casa!

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A Nevada parole board decided Simpson should be freed after the former NFL star apologized for his role in a 2007 armed robbery, said he'd been a model prisoner, and promised that he'd have no conflicts if released. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Simpson's appearance before the board garnered wall-to-wall coverage from cable news shows, coverage that recalled the \"trial of the century,\" and the many months more than 20 years ago when it transfixed a nation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I've done my time,\" Simpson said. \"I've done it as well and as respectfully as I think anyone can.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now 70, Simpson's energy seemed little affected by his time behind bars. He was alert, engaged, and quick to smile, even letting out a hearty laugh when parole board Chairman Connie Bisbee accidentally said he was aged 90. \"I feel like it,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Simpson has served nine years of a nine-to-33-year sentence for an armed robbery and kidnapping in Las Vegas. He is expected to be released as early as October -- and said he plans to move to his home in Florida. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An entire generation of Americans has come of age since Simpson seemed an almost inescapable public figure. But for one afternoon, it felt like 1995 again. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That was the year he was acquitted of murder charges in the grisly slayings of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Thursday's parole hearing followed renewed interest in his story, which was explored last year in the award-winning documentary \"O.J.: Made in America\" and the FX true-crime drama \"The People v. O.J. Simpson.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Though it's been 22 years since the not guilty verdict, the murder trial's themes of criminal justice and race, trust in police, celebrity and domestic violence remain remarkably resonant in modern culture. \"We talk about O.J. as though the story is O.J.,\" journalist Celia Farber says toward the end of the \"Made in America\" documentary. \"The story is O.J. and us.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Parole board vote unanimous NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For his part, Simpson seemed remarkably unaltered. He repeatedly avoided taking full responsibility for the Vegas crime. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At one point, he said he had lived a \"conflict-free life,\" a statement that perhaps bemused anyone whose memory stretches back more than two decades. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Juice,\" as he was known in his heyday, said associates misled him during the Vegas robbery and then turned on him in court. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One of those associates is Tom Riccio. Simpson testified that Riccio is the one who called him, persuading him to take part in the robbery. Simpson said Thursday he regretted ever taking Riccio's call. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But, according to Riccio, Simpson did a lot more than that. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"He should wish he didn't make all those calls after my call,\" Riccio told CNN. \"After he took my call he did a lot of things he shouldn't have done.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Riccio added that Simpson was the one who orchestrated the robbery. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"He plotted it all and gathered up men with guns.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Simpson said Riccio avoided punishment by throwing him under the bus. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Unfortunately, they got a get-out-of-jail-free card when they said 'O.J. told me (to do it),'\" Simpson said. \"Nothing I can do about that.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sufficient remorse is not a relevant factor for parole, and Simpson ticked off several mitigating factors that made him a good candidate for release. He was discipline-free in prison, he has stable release plans, he has family and community support -- and, of course, he has no prior criminal convictions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The four parole board members voted unanimously to grant him parole, and board member Tony Corda said he was graded a \"low risk to reoffend.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Simpson smiled, said \"thank you,\" and then put his head down for a few moments silently.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I've spent nine years making no excuses about anything. I am sorry that things turned out the way they did. I had no intent to commit a crime.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The parole hearing featured testimony from Arnelle Simpson, the former football great's oldest daughter, who said her father was \"my best friend and my rock.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Simpson also said he has taken two \"Alternative to Violence\" classes, which he said was \"the most important course any person in this prison can take.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In addition, robbery victim Bruce Fromong testified that he had forgiven Simpson for the crime at that Las Vegas hotel room, and advocated for his release. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Simpson had also been described by authorities as a model prisoner at Lovelock Correctional Center, a medium-security prison in the Nevada desert.

He also claimed he didn't know his associates were armed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I wasn't there to hurt anybody,\" Simpson said. \"I just wanted my personal things, and I realize now that was stupid of me. I am sorry.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The case, which featured a colorful cast of seedy characters, secret recordings and a Las Vegas heist, read like a low-budget parody of \"Ocean's Eleven,\" CNN wrote at the time NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Photos: The rise and fall of O.J.

        "summary": "\u2013 OJ Simpson's big moment has arrived. A hearing is underway at which he is trying to convince members of the Nevada Board of Parole that he should go free. \"I haven't made any excuses in the nine years that I've been here and I'm not trying to make an excuse now,\" said the 70-year-old Simpson early in the proceedings, per the AP. Later, he added, \"I am sorry that things turned out the way they did. I had no intent to commit a crime.\" He also appeared to stifle a sob in his appeal to the board. Simpson has been imprisoned since 2008 over an armed robbery and kidnapping case, but he and many legal analysts think that the board will vote to release him. If so, he's expected to be out on Oct. 1. The televised hearing is being livestreamed at various sites, including CNN. Per CNN, one of the first questions posed to Simpson by a board member in regard to the robbery, in which he and other men entered a Vegas hotel room to reclaim sports memorabilia, was, \"What were you thinking?\" Simpson called it a \"big mistake\" and emphasized that he wasn't armed. \"I would never pull a gun on anybody.\" He insisted that he learned only afterward that one of the men with him, who was \"behind me,\" brandished a gun. Another board member noted that he hadn't taken an alcohol-abuse program as he promised he would at his last hearing. Other Simpson quotes: \"I'm at a point in my life where all I want to do is spend as much time with my children.\" \"I've basically spent a conflict-free life.\" Daughter Arnelle Simpson said her father is \"remorseful,\" and she wants him to come home so they can \"move forward,\" adding, \"It's been hard.\"\n"

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The university announced in April that it was investigating accusations that Dr. Richard Strauss, who died in 2005, abused team members when he was the team doctor from the mid-1970s to late 1990s. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jordan, who was assistant wrestling coach at the university from 1986 to 1994, has repeatedly said he knew nothing of the abuse until former students began speaking out this spring, and continued to deny it on Tuesday. His denials, however, have been met with skepticism and anger from some former members of the wrestling team. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Three former wrestlers told NBC News that it was common knowledge that Strauss showered regularly with the students and inappropriately touched them during appointments, and said it would have been impossible for Jordan to be unaware; one wrestler said he told Jordan directly about the abuse. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Former head coach Russ Hellickson, Jordan's mentor, said in a recent video \u2014 made by Mike DiSabato, a former wrestler \u2014 that Hellickson had told Strauss that he was being too \"hands on\u201d with students. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR DiSabato, whose allegations against Strauss prompted Ohio State to open its investigation, called Jordan a \u201cliar.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cI considered Jim Jordan a friend,\u201d DiSabato said. \u201cBut at the end of the day, he is absolutely lying if he says he doesn\u2019t know what was going on.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR DiSabato said he reached out to Jordan this year, before going to the university, to tell Jordan that he planned to go public with his allegations. Jordan told him to \u201cplease leave me out of it,\u201d DiSabato said. \u201cHe asked me not to get him involved.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"At the end of the day, he is absolutely lying if he says he doesn\u2019t know what was going on.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dunyasha Yetts, who wrestled at Ohio State in 1993 and 1994, said he and others told Jordan about Strauss. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cI remember I had a thumb injury and went into Strauss\u2019 office and he started pulling down my wrestling shorts,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m like, what the f--- are you doing? And I went out and told Russ and Jim what happened. I was not having it. They went in and talked to Strauss.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Yetts said he and his teammates talked to Jordan numerous times about Strauss. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, Strauss\u2019s locker was right next to Jordan\u2019s and Jordan even said he\u2019d kill him if he tried anything with him,\u201d Yetts said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Yetts admitted that he did time for bilking investors out of nearly $2 million. \u201cI am not a perfect person, but ask any of the wrestlers and they will tell you everybody knew about Doc,\u201d said Yetts, who served 18 months in prison. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As for Jordan, Yetts said, \u201cHe\u2019s a great guy. We would have all these great talks with him and he talked about how one day he\u2019d be the president of the United States.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"So it\u2019s sad for me to hear that he\u2019s denying knowing about Strauss,\" he said. \"I don\u2019t know why he would, unless it\u2019s a cover-up. Either you\u2019re in on it, or you\u2019re a liar.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A former teammate of DiSabato\u2019s who asked not to be identified said he never told Jordan directly that Strauss had abused him. But there is no way Jordan could have avoided the rumors \u201cbecause it was all over the locker room.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cI love Jimmy to death,\u201d the ex-wrestler said. \u201cIt was a head-scratcher to me why he would say he didn\u2019t know anything. Doc used to take showers with the team even though he didn\u2019t do any workouts, and everybody used to snicker about how you go into his office for a sore shoulder and he tells you to take your pants down.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When the first stories about the university investigation appeared this spring, Jordan told The Columbus Dispatch, \u201cI had not heard about any type of abuse at all.\u201d He also said that \u201cno one reported any type of abuse\u201d to him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After NBC News reached out to Jordan, the congressman\u2019s spokesman repeated the denial. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cCongressman Jordan never saw any abuse, never heard about any abuse, and never had any abuse reported to him during his time as a coach at Ohio State,\u201d his spokesman, Ian Fury, said in an email to NBC News. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Shortly after the NBC News story was published, Fury added the following statement: \"He has not been contacted by investigators about the matter but will assist them in any way they ask, because if what is alleged is true, the victims deserve a full investigation and justice.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Kathleen Trafford of Porter Wright Morris & Arthur, the Dayton, Ohio-based law firm that was appointed as legal counsel to Ohio State, said in a statement that investigators \"had previously contacted Rep. Jordan's office by email and phone to request that he participate in an interview.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"To date, Rep. Jordan has not responded to those requests,\" Trafford wrote. \"The investigative team is continuing its efforts to schedule an interview with Rep. Jordan.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jordan, a founder of the House Freedom Caucus, a group of the most conservative representatives, is a staunch ally of President Donald Trump and is frequently mentioned as a possible replacement for the speaker of the House, Paul Ryan. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ryan, through his spokesman Doug Andres, also weighed in on the Ohio State investigation and Jordan's role. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"These are serious allegations and issues,\" Andres said. \"The university has rightfully initiated a full investigation into the matter. The speaker will await the findings of that inquiry.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR DiSabato forwarded to NBC News an email he sent on April 24 to Jordan and the congressman\u2019s brother, Jeff, who runs Jeff Jordan's State Champ Camp, a nationally known wrestling camp in Ohio. DiSabato sent the email 19 days after Ohio State announced on April 5 that it was investigating Strauss and the administrators of the wrestling program at the time, including the coaches, just as other colleges have done in similar circumstances. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR DiSabato was concerned that the university would ultimately sweep his allegations under the rug, and he wanted to ensure that Jordan would back him up. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cI ask you to give your full attention to the information attached to this email,\u201d DiSabato wrote. \u201cWe [are] watching you. \u2026 You have the platform to cut through the double talk, placation and finger pointing.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jordan and his brother did not reply to the email, DiSabato said. Jeff Jordan said in an email that he'd never attended or worked at Ohio State University. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rep.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the video that DiSabato made about the allegations against Strauss, which DiSabato sent to Ohio State in June, Hellickson, the former head wrestling coach, said he told school administrators about Strauss and also warned the doctor to steer clear of his wrestlers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cI said, \u2018You make the guys nervous when you shower with them,\u2019\u201d Hellickson said in the video. \u201cHis response was, \u2018Coach, you shower with your guys all the time.\u2019 And I said, \u2018Not for an hour, Doc.\u2019\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR DiSabato and his former teammates said Jordan and Hellickson were close, and if the head coach had qualms about Strauss he would have shared them with his No. 2. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cJim was Coach Russ\u2019 right-hand man,\u201d one former wrestler said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hellickson, an Olympics silver medalist in wrestling in 1976 who has done commentary from the games for NBC Sports, did not return calls for comment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In response to a series of questions from NBC, Ohio State emailed a statement saying that the law firm Perkins Coie was overseeing the probe into the Strauss allegations for the university. OSU said it has also reached out \u201cto the Columbus Division of Police and the Franklin County Prosecuting Attorney\u2019s Office for any potential criminal investigation.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cTo date, Perkins Coie has interviewed more than 150 former students and witnesses and is engaged in further investigative efforts,\u201d the university said in the statement. \u201cOhio State has shared all additional information that has come to the attention of the university with the independent investigators whose work is ongoing.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It\u2019s unclear whether former Ohio State coaches or administrators could face any penalties from the university for not protecting wrestlers from Strauss. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cOur efforts will continue to be focused on uncovering what may have happened during this era, what university leaders at the time may have known, and whether any response at the time was appropriate,\u201d the university\u2019s statement said. \u201cOnce the independent investigation has been completed, we will be in a position to consider what further action might be appropriate.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jordan is wrestling royalty. Born and raised in Champaign County, Ohio, he was a four-time state wrestling champion. Competing for the University of Wisconsin-Madison, he won NCAA titles in 1985 and 1986. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But in the wrestling world, Jordan is best known for defeating future two-time Olympic gold medalist John Smith twice in an NCAA tournament in 1985. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jordan returned home to Ohio and \u2014 while working as a coach \u2014 earned a master\u2019s degree in education at Ohio State and later a law degree from Capital University in Columbus before launching his political career in 1994 when he was elected to the Ohio General Assembly.

Ohio State University via AP file NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Strauss signed on at Ohio State as an attending physician in September 1978 and served as a team physician in the athletics department from July 1981 to June 1995, according to the university\u2019s statement. He also worked as a part-time doctor in the university\u2019s student health department from July 1994 to August 1996. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After resigning from the Ohio State medical staff in 1994, Strauss stayed on as an emeritus faculty member until he retired in July 1998 and moved from Columbus to Los Angeles, the university said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Citing Los Angeles County coroner records, The Columbus Dispatch reported that Strauss died of suicide in 2005 after struggling with pain and other health issues. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Strauss\u2019 relatives have not spoken publicly about the allegations since they surfaced. NBC News was not able to reach any of his relatives. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR DiSabato, who runs a Columbus-based sports and entertainment agency called the Profectus Group, said the recent conviction of former Olympics gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar prompted him and other Ohio State athletes to come forward about Strauss. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Strauss\u2019 primary job was to give wrestlers physicals, treat them for injuries and monitor their health, DiSabato said. He said Strauss also preyed on students who played other sports. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cStrauss sexually assaulted male athletes in at least fifteen varsity sports during his employment at OSU from 1978 through 1998,\u201d DiSabato wrote in a June 26 email to Kathleen M. Trafford of Porter Wright Morris & Arthur, the Columbus-based law firm that represents Ohio State. \u201cAthlete victims include members of the following programs: football, basketball, wrestling, swimming, cheerleading, volleyball, lacrosse, gymnastics, ice hockey, soccer, baseball, tennis, track and cross country.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Chillingly, DiSabato added: \u201cBased on testimony from victim athletes from each of the aforementioned varsity sports, we estimate that Strauss sexually assaulted and/or raped a minimum of 1,500/2,000 athletes at OSU from 1978 through 1998.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ohio State has confirmed that investigators have received \u201cconfidential reports of sexual misconduct committed by Strauss\u201d from former athletes in 14 sports and from former patients in Student Health Services. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the video, DiSabato said Strauss knew that many of the athletes were small-town kids who weren\u2019t likely to protest if the doctor told them to disrobe, for fear of losing their scholarships. He said coaches knew that Strauss was a predator. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cEverybody knew before you were going into the [examination] room that Doc Strauss was going to touch you,\u201d DiSabato said. \u201cIt was like a joke before you went in there.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Strauss wasn\u2019t the only Ohio State official who showered with the team, DiSabato said. After practice ended at 3:30 p.m., some university professors, administrators and others would show up in the shower stalls just as the athletes were arriving, he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It was, DiSabato said, like walking through \u201cthe gauntlet of sexual deviancy.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Another former wrestler whose testimony appears on the video DiSabato submitted to investigators described how Strauss grabbed his penis during an examination. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cI didn\u2019t do a thing,\u201d he said when asked how he responded. \u201cProbably, because I was scared.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He broke down when asked why, after all these years, he was speaking out. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cWhy am I doing this now? It\u2019s just hard,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want this to ever have to happen to anybody else, ever \u2026 at The Ohio State University or any school.\u201d\n",
        "summary": "\u2013 The number of Ohio State wrestlers who've come forward to say Rep. Jim Jordan knew about abuse at the hands of their team doctor is rising, despite Jordan's adamant denials. After an initial report on three former wrestlers, NBC News interviews a fourth accuser, Shawn Dailey, who says he was groped several times by Dr. Richard Strauss in the mid-'90s, when Jordan was the team's assistant coach. \"It was very common knowledge in the locker room that if you went to Dr. Strauss for anything, you would have to pull your pants down,\" Dailey, now 43, says, adding he never approached Jordan about his own abuse but took part in locker room discussions about Strauss with Jordan. Dailey specifically backs up the account of former teammate Dunyasha Yetts, saying Jordan's reply to Yetts after Yetts complained about Strauss was: \"If he tried that with me, I would kill him.\" Dailey notes he's a Republican, like Jordan, whom he calls a \"close friend\" and \"good guy\" whose campaign he donated to in 1994. Still, \"what happened drove me out of the sport,\" he says. \"So I was surprised to hear Jim say that he knew nothing about it. \u2026 That's kind of hurtful.\" Former UFC champ Mark Coleman also speaks out, telling the Wall Street Journal \"there's no way unless [Jordan's] got dementia or something that he's got no recollection of what was going on at Ohio State. \u2026 I have nothing but respect for this man, I love this man, but he knew as far as I'm concerned.\" Meanwhile, President Trump has weighed in, telling reporters Thursday that he believes Jordan \"100%, no question in my mind.\" \"Jim Jordan is one of the most outstanding people I've met since I've been in Washington,\" Trump said, adding he doesn't believe the allegations against him \"at all.\"\n"

Dispatchers had that information from a cell phone tracking device. But, the caller wasn't able to tell dispatchers anything else valuable before the call was lost.She didn't answer when they called back. That's when Medlin had an idea.

        "document": "The change comes as card fraud has more than doubled in the U.S. over the last 15 years while falling in much of the rest of the world where chip-enabled cards have been in place for much of that time. ||||| Advertisement NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Recently received a new credit card that has a microchip on its front? Wondering about the change? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Credit cards with security chips are a part of the new card processing system being adopted by the U.S., whereby the card used by a consumer will have a special microchip that will need to be inserted in a reader rather than swiped at a checkout terminal to close a transaction. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The new credit cards look like any old credit card except that they have a tiny metallic chip on the front. The chip-embedded cards deploy EMV microchips, which is short for Europay, MasterCard and Visa. This system is already in use in several parts of Europe. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The microchip basically contains a user's payment information, which so far was contained on the magnetic strip. The microchip also gives a novel code which is different for every purchase. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The transition to chip-enabled credit cards will make life more difficult for criminals as they are more secure than magnetic strip-only cards. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR How? Because the microprocessor in the microchips - which is like a mini computer - adds an additional layer of security for each transaction. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to Visa's Stephanie Erickson, Head of Authentication Product Integration, while criminals were able to make counterfeit physical copies of magnetic strip-based cards, the chip-based cards will make the process more difficult. Since the chips contain data relating to a specific purchase, their reproduction is tough. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"They can't create a counterfeit card which is two-thirds of the fraud we see in the system,\" says Erickson. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Moreover, Erickson opines that countries which shifted to this technology within two years of the transition, saw the counterfeit reduce by 60 to 70 percent. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some may argue that the unique transaction code generated by the chip every single time the credit card is used may lead to a compromise. However, experts alleviate the fear by assuring that even if the code was gotten hold of by a thief it would be worthless. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One, however, would still be required to sign even when deploying a chip-based card. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While the new system promises more safety, a downside of the new microchip-based credit cards is that they take longer to process when compared to the older system. If an old swipe transaction took three to five seconds, then this \"dip\" method takes between five to ten seconds. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The increased time for transaction would impact the lines at the checkout and could be a problem especially during high-traffic periods such as Black Friday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Oct. 1, merchants - not card issuers - will be responsible for fraudulent transactions if they don't upgrade their payment terminals. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u00a9 2016 Tech Times, All rights reserved. Do not reproduce without permission. ||||| On Thursday, merchants who cannot process chip-enabled cards could become liable for fraudulent transactions at their stores. MasterCard and Visa set the deadline for the new rules, which are part of their agreements with the retailers and banks that use their networks. American Express will shift liability on Oct. 16. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Consumers, however, will not be caught in the middle. Federal law requires banks to reimburse consumers for different types of fraud. The only difference is that, come Thursday, banks could go after retailers that have not properly updated their equipment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Not everyone will have chip-enabled cards by the deadline. While most customers at the big banks like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America will receive their cards by the end of the year, some will not get new cards until 2016. Some issuers will also wait until customers\u2019 existing cards are close to expiring. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Credit and debit cards without chips will continue to work until they expire, or until consumers activate their new cards. And they will still work at payment terminals that have been updated to accommodate chips. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But new machines will prompt users who swipe a chip card to dip it instead. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cYou should always use the chip device, not the swipe device,\u201d said Ed Mierzwinski, the consumer program director of U.S. PIRG, the federation of state public interest groups.\n",

Consumers have been receiving new cards with fraud-prevention chips and on Thursday, a lot more retailers will be asking customers to put their card in a reader instead of swiping it, reports the Los Angeles Times. Oct. 1 is the day that the credit card industry will start shifting liability for fraudulent transactions to issuers and merchants that haven't adopted the new technology, which is already used in much of the rest of the world and is credited with dramatically reducing fraud by making it harder to duplicate cards. Cards without chips will continue to work until they expire, though experts tell the New York Times that consumers who have the choice should always opt to dip a card in a reader instead of swiping it. The chips in the new cards use a system known as EMV, for creators Europay, MasterCard, and Visa. They contain buyer information and add an extra level of security by creating a new code for every purchase, Tech Times explains. In Europe, consumers need to enter a PIN, but US retailers will only require signatures. Around 70% of cards will have chips by the end of this year, according to the LA Times, though the full switch is expected to take years. Retailers worry that the extra few seconds per purchase will slow down businesses at peak times\u2014and that more fraud will now take place online. \"It's like closing the front door but leaving the back door open,\" a National Retail Federation exec tells the New York Times. \"The thieves will figure out that the back door is unlocked.\"\n"

        "document": "After a freshman died from downing beer, rum and 151-proof liquor in an initiation ritual, California Polytechnic State University in 2010 banned fraternities from recruiting newly arrived students. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Right away, the North-American Interfraternity Conference, which represents 75 national fraternities, jumped in. The Indianapolis-based trade group e-mailed and met with Cal Poly administrators, paid for a study that opposed the ban and spurred a three-year campaign by student leaders. It won, and the school lifted the restriction this year. One freshman, Charlie Ross, couldn\u2019t be happier about the opportunity to join a fraternity right away instead of waiting three months. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cYou\u2019ve got a group of guys who watch out for you when you\u2019re drinking,\u201d Ross, 18, said after unpacking his bags at freshman orientation on the San Luis Obispo campus. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Related Stories: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The university\u2019s turnabout shows how the Interfraternity Conference is blocking an approach that some higher education leaders say can save lives: postponing recruitment of freshmen, who account for a disproportionate number of fraternity-related deaths. The conference has opposed proposals at dozens of colleges to delay recruiting by a semester or a year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThese organizations were putting our freshmen at risk,\u201d said Shirley Tilghman, former president of Princeton University, which prohibited fraternity recruiting of freshmen, starting in the fall of 2012. \u201cThere is so much vulnerability in that first week, that first month as a freshman on a college campus -- of feeling lost. It leads to all kinds of decisions that you would not make if you had a little more time to find your way.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Freshmen Deaths NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Princeton students who belonged to fraternities, especially freshmen, were more likely to be hospitalized because of drinking, said Tilghman, who stepped down as president in June. Of 60 fraternity-related deaths nationwide since 2005, 24, or 40 percent, were of freshmen, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Universities often are susceptible to the Interfraternity Conference\u2019s pressure to recruit freshmen because Greek life appeals to applicants and many alumni donors remain loyal to their fraternities. Only 80 of about 800 U.S. campuses with fraternities defer recruiting, according to the conference. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fraternity membership surged to 327,260 in 2011 from 253,148 in 2005. National fraternities and affiliated foundations generated $185 million in student dues and other revenue in 2010-2011, up 24 percent from 2005-2006, tax records show. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Binge Drinking NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR White male fraternity members drink more heavily than any other group on campus, and published research suggests that the youngest students are most likely to engage in binge drinking, according to Aaron White, program director for college and underage drinking prevention research at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThe first couple of months of school are a particularly vulnerable time for students with regard to heavy drinking,\u201d White said. \u201cDelaying rush makes a lot of sense.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Founded in 1909, the Interfraternity Conference joined the industry\u2019s political arm, known as FratPAC, in fighting against a federal anti-hazing bill last year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The group has stepped up advocacy on campuses, especially against recruiting restrictions. With its encouragement, fraternity leaders at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland rejected a 2011 plan to defer recruiting freshmen. At the University of Colorado at Boulder, the conference backed fraternities\u2019 decision to operate without university recognition, reducing their access to campus facilities, rather than accept deferred recruitment and live-in advisers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lawsuit Threat NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThe NIC was not supportive\u201d of university rules, said Deb Coffin, Colorado vice chancellor for student affairs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The University of Central Florida this year lifted a recruitment moratorium, which had been prompted by excessive drinking at fraternities and sororities, after the Interfraternity Conference threatened to sue the school for violating students\u2019 freedom-of-association rights. The national group\u2019s threat didn\u2019t influence the university, said Maribeth Ehasz, a Central Florida vice president. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Of the 24 fraternity-related freshman deaths since 2005, 15 occurred during and after recruiting events, including hazing and initiation rituals. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At Northern Illinois University in DeKalb, freshman David Bogenberger died last year of alcohol poisoning after a fraternity initiation rite known as \u201cMom and Dad\u2019s Night.\u201d With other pledges, Bogenberger moved from room to room at the chapter house answering questions from members and downing vodka before passing out, court records show. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fraternity Measures NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fraternities have taken steps to protect students, including banning alcohol at recruiting events and supporting sanctions against violators, said Peter Smithhisler, president of the Interfraternity Conference. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While drinking deaths at fraternities are \u201cheartbreaking,\u201d many students drink too much, not just at fraternities, he said. Keeping out freshmen merely puts a \u201cBand-Aid\u201d on a broader campus problem, he said. It also deprives freshmen of opportunities at fraternities for leadership, career networking and charitable work, he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cIt would be a travesty if the fraternity experience were not available for the development of these young men,\u201d Smithhisler said. \u201cWe believe in the fraternity experience and its ability to really transform an undergraduate into better men, better citizens, better doctors, teachers, engineers.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fraternities\u2019 Lifeblood NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If colleges are allowed to restrict recruitment for a semester or a year, they could next extend the delay through sophomore year, or even shut down fraternities, as some liberal arts institutions have done, he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cRecruitment is the lifeblood for every chapter,\u201d Smithhisler said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Carson Starkey, whose death prompted the Cal Poly ban, hadn\u2019t planned on joining a fraternity until he arrived at the public university of 19,000 on the central California coast. One out of six undergraduates there participate in Greek life. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The clean-cut, curly-haired 18-year-old from Austin, Texas, knew no one on campus, and the opportunity to bond with fraternity brothers soon appealed to him. He chose to pledge Sigma Alpha Epsilon, one of the largest fraternities, with chapters on almost 230 campuses in the U.S. and Canada. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u2018Drink Up\u2019 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While it included other activities such as a scavenger hunt, much of Sigma Alpha Epsilon\u2019s initiation revolved around alcohol. After Thanksgiving, fraternity members summoned Starkey and 16 other pledges to the garage of an off-campus house for \u201cBrown Bag Night.\u201d Tarps covered couches to protect them from vomit, according to court testimony. Pledges sat in a circle, with a trash can at the center. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At 10:30 p.m., each pledge was given a brown bag with cans and bottles of alcohol. \u201cDrink up, finish by midnight,\u201d said one upperclassman, according to court testimony. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Starkey\u2019s bag had two 24-ounce cans of Steel Reserve beer, a 16-ounce can of Sparks alcoholic energy drink, and a fifth of rum he was to split with another pledge, one of several Sigma Alpha Epsilon brothers who bought the liquor testified. Pledges also shared a bottle of 151-proof Everclear, which is 75.5 percent alcohol. As members chanted \u201cPuke and Rally,\u201d Starkey emptied his bag in 20 minutes, court records show. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dirty Mattress NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After Starkey passed out, fraternity brothers debated whether to drive him to a hospital less than a mile away, members testified. They placed Starkey in a car and removed his Sigma Alpha Epsilon pin, so that doctors wouldn\u2019t know he was at a fraternity event. Then they changed their minds. Rather than go to the hospital, they brought him back in the house and left him on a dirty mattress, according to court records and Starkey\u2019s mother, Julia. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Starkey died on Dec. 2, 2008, 71 days after starting college. He had a blood-alcohol content of 0.44, or about five times the legal limit, according to court testimony. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Four fraternity brothers pleaded no contest to misdemeanor charges related to hazing. They were sentenced to jail terms ranging from 30 to 120 days. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Starkeys sued Sigma Alpha Epsilon and several members for negligence, settling for at least $2.45 million, court records show. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sigma Alpha Epsilon is committed to \u201cproviding a meaningful, beneficial and safe experience\u201d for all members, the national fraternity said in a statement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cal Poly barred Sigma Alpha Epsilon from campus until 2033 and considered eliminating fraternities. Instead, it stepped up oversight and decided in 2010 to delay freshman recruiting until January, the school\u2019s second quarter. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u2018Huge Pushback\u2019 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Soon after the policy was announced, \u201cthere was a huge pushback\u201d from the fraternity industry, said Stephan Lamb, then the university\u2019s associate director of student life. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Smithhisler and other Interfraternity Conference executives visited the school in 2010 to ask administrators to rescind deferred recruitment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThe hand-wringing has started\u201d among fraternity leaders about Cal Poly\u2019s limits on recruitment, Smithhisler wrote in a Jan. 12, 2011, e-mail to Lamb obtained through a request to the university under California\u2019s open-records law. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The next month, the trade group sent industry experts to Cal Poly to conduct an in-depth assessment of the school\u2019s Greek system, according to university records. Typically, universities request such an evaluation and pay an $8,000 fee. In this instance, the conference covered the cost. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Stealing, Drinking NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The report was hardly flattering. The assessment, prepared by fraternity executives, college administrators and a social worker, called Cal Poly\u2019s recruitment \u201cdehumanizing and superficial\u201d and said alcohol was \u201ca, and perhaps THE, defining factor\u201d of Greek life. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cHazing occurs in the men\u2019s chapters, particularly physical/strength endurance, stealing and drinking,\u201d it said. \u201cAlcohol plays a major role in the Cal Poly fraternity/sorority experience, especially within fraternity life.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Still, the report called for an end to deferred recruitment because it runs \u201ccounter to a student\u2019s right to choose.\u201d The policy unfairly required fraternities, but not sororities, to postpone rush, according to the assessment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The national group worked through students, too. Andy Farrell, who headed Cal Poly\u2019s student fraternity group in 2010, said Smithhisler took him aside and \u201cmade it clear that the [Interfraternity Conference] stand is that deferred recruitment should not exist.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fighting Rules NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR National fraternities urged their Cal Poly chapters to fight the new rule, said Michael Franceschi, another student leader at the time. When students organized, the conference supplied them with research and helped edit a paper arguing against deferred recruitment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cWe\u2019d send them drafts of each section,\u201d said Jason Colombini, then a campus fraternity leader and now student body president. \u201cThey would tell us things to look into.\u201d Colombini said he acted on his own initiative, not the Interfraternity Conference\u2019s. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Turnover at the top of Cal Poly aided the fraternity cause. Jeffrey Armstrong, who became Cal Poly\u2019s president in 2011, and Keith Humphrey, vice president for student affairs, sympathized with students\u2019 pleas, Colombini said. Unlike their predecessors, Armstrong and Humphrey had been in fraternities, and Armstrong met his wife through his membership in Alpha Gamma Rho. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In June, Cal Poly announced it would abolish deferred recruiting at its 17 fraternities. In return, fraternity members agreed to register their parties, undergo alcohol education and submit to periodic reviews. About $100,000 in higher fees from fraternity members will fund a new university position monitoring Greek life. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u2018More Control\u2019 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The university didn\u2019t bow to fraternity pressure, Humphrey said. It simply wanted fraternity and sorority recruitment on the same schedule. Deferred recruiting isn\u2019t a \u201csilver bullet,\u201d Armstrong said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cWe\u2019re going to gain a lot more control\u201d through the agreement with fraternity members, Armstrong said. \u201cThere will be a lot more accountability.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Interfraternity Conference assured the university that fraternities had shown \u201chigher alcohol awareness.\u201d Humphrey agreed, saying that students are taking alcohol safety more seriously. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cWe\u2019re entering a different day,\u201d he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Still, the number of people transported to the hospital by Cal Poly police because of alcohol doubled to 35, in 2012-2013, from 2008, the year Starkey died. The statistics don\u2019t indicate how many belonged to fraternities. The increase shows that students are more willing to call for help, said Martin Bragg, Cal Poly\u2019s director of health and counseling services. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lambda Cabana NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Since 2011, the university has disciplined nine fraternities, in most cases for alleged alcohol-related violations. After Lambda Chi Alpha\u2019s \u201cLambda Cabana\u201d beach volleyball tournament and charity fundraiser in April, three underage partygoers went to the hospital with alcohol poisoning, according to university records. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The university suspended Lambda Chi activities. Lambda Chi Alpha said it hadn\u2019t organized any parties after the fundraiser, records show. Graham Garland, president of its Cal Poly chapter, declined to comment. The university later lifted the suspension because an investigation didn\u2019t support allegations against the fraternity, Humphrey said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In an editorial this month, the student paper, the Mustang News, said fraternities haven\u2019t changed their behavior since Starkey\u2019s death, and the administration made a mistake in letting them recruit freshman right away. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cCal Poly is opening the door for more trouble,\u201d the editorial said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Parents Troubled NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Carson Starkey\u2019s parents, while pleased with the alcohol education program, opposed ending deferred recruitment. They run a nonprofit group to raise awareness about alcohol poisoning. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cI find it troubling that they [fraternities] would be advocating against our efforts to try to save lives,\u201d said Julia Starkey, 52. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Her son would be alive if recruitment came later, she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cI\u2019m 200 percent sure he wouldn\u2019t have joined,\u201d she said. \u201cHis core group of friends were outside the fraternity, but that didn\u2019t happen the first weeks of school.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fraternities are putting revenue ahead of safety, said his father, Scott Starkey, 54. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cIf you defer the recruitment of your members, you\u2019re deferring income, I get that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re business people. But I also feel there\u2019s a human side.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Welcoming Freshmen NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On a crisp late summer day during freshman orientation last month at Cal Poly, posters near dormitory entrances urged students to wear black wristbands with the name of the Starkeys\u2019 charity: \u201cAware Awake Alive.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cTake care of yourself,\u201d read the posters. \u201cTake care of your friends.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Freshmen were divided over the new rush policy. Adam Massini, 18, from La Quinta, California, said it would be better to delay recruitment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cFreshmen haven\u2019t had much experience with drinking and don\u2019t know their limits,\u201d said Massini, who is considering joining a fraternity to perform community service. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Waiting isn\u2019t going to stop freshmen from drinking heavily, said Grant Caraway, a former star high school football quarterback from Granite Bay, California. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cSome guys are going to be stupid, no matter what,\u201d Caraway said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With formal recruiting weeks away, a banner hung outside the Lambda Chi Alpha house. In bold, block letters, it greeted freshmen: \u201cWelcoming You the Right Way Since 1979.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While deferred recruiting gave freshmen more time to choose a fraternity, Lambda Chi now has no choice but to pursue them right away, said Joe Hare, 21, its vice president. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cIf all the fraternities do it, we can\u2019t wait,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s social suicide.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To contact the reporters on this story: John Hechinger in Boston at jhechinger@bloomberg.net; David Glovin in New York at dglovin@bloomberg.net NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To contact the editor responsible for this story: Dan Golden at dlgolden@bloomberg.net ||||| One warm spring night in 2011, a young man named Travis Hughes stood on the back deck of the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity house at Marshall University, in West Virginia, and was struck by what seemed to him\u2014under the influence of powerful inebriants, not least among them the clear ether of youth itself\u2014to be an excellent idea: he would shove a bottle rocket up his ass and blast it into the sweet night air. And perhaps it was an excellent idea. What was not an excellent idea, however, was to misjudge the relative tightness of a 20-year-old sphincter and the propulsive reliability of a 20-cent bottle rocket. What followed ignition was not the bright report of a successful blastoff, but the muffled thud of fire in the hole. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Also on the deck, and also in the thrall of the night\u2019s pleasures, was one Louis Helmburg III, an education major and ace benchwarmer for the Thundering Herd baseball team. His response to the proposed launch was the obvious one: he reportedly whipped out his cellphone to record it on video, which would turn out to be yet another of the night\u2019s seemingly excellent but ultimately misguided ideas. When the bottle rocket exploded in Hughes\u2019s rectum, Helmburg was seized by the kind of battlefield panic that has claimed brave men from outfits far more illustrious than even the Thundering Herd. Terrified, he staggered away from the human bomb and fell off the deck. Fortunately for him, and adding to the Chaplinesque aspect of the night\u2019s miseries, the deck was no more than four feet off the ground, but such was the urgency of his escape that he managed to get himself wedged between the structure and an air-conditioning unit, sustaining injuries that would require medical attention, cut short his baseball season, and\u2014in the fullness of time\u2014pit him against the mighty forces of the Alpha Tau Omega national organization, which had been waiting for him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Phil Toledano NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It takes a certain kind of personal-injury lawyer to look at the facts of this glittering night and wrest from them a plausible plaintiff and defendant, unless it were possible for Travis Hughes to be sued by his own anus. But the fraternity lawsuit is a lucrative mini-segment of the personal-injury business, and if ever there was a deck that ought to have had a railing, it was the one that served as a nighttime think tank and party-idea testing ground for the brain trust of the Theta Omicron Chapter of Alpha Tau Omega and its honored guests\u2014including these two knuckleheads, who didn\u2019t even belong to the fraternity. Moreover, the building codes of Huntington, West Virginia, are unambiguous on the necessity of railings on elevated decks. Whether Helmburg stumbled in reaction to an exploding party guest or to the Second Coming of Jesus Christ is immaterial; there should have been a railing to catch him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And so it was that Louis Helmburg III joined forces with Timothy P. Rosinsky, Esq., a slip-and-fall lawyer from Huntington who had experience also with dog-bite, DUI, car-repossession, and drug cases. The events of that night, laid out in Helmburg\u2019s complaint, suggested a relatively straightforward lawsuit. But the suit would turn out to have its own repeated failures to launch and unintended collateral damage, and it would include an ever-widening and desperate search for potential defendants willing to foot the modest bill for Helmburg\u2019s documented injuries. Sending a lawyer without special expertise in wrangling with fraternities to sue one of them is like sending a Boy Scout to sort out the unpleasantness in Afghanistan. Who knows? The kid could get lucky. But it never hurts\u2014preparedness and all that\u2014to send him off with a body bag.

Fraternities really do breed leaders\u2014a cohort of young men dedicated to being loyal, being knowledgeable, and embracing the skills of leadership success.\" Read the full story by Maria Konnikova NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR College fraternities\u2014by which term of art I refer to the formerly all-white, now nominally integrated men\u2019s \u201cgeneral\u201d or \u201csocial\u201d fraternities, and not the several other types of fraternities on American campuses (religious, ethnic, academic)\u2014are as old, almost, as the republic. In a sense, they are older: they emanated in part from the Freemasons, of which George Washington himself was a member. When arguments are made in their favor, they are arguments in defense of a foundational experience for millions of American young men, and of a system that helped build American higher education as we know it. Fraternities also provide their members with matchless leadership training. While the system has produced its share of poets, aesthetes, and Henry James scholars, it is far more famous for its success in the powerhouse fraternity fields of business, law, and politics. An astonishing number of CEOs of Fortune 500 companies, congressmen and male senators, and American presidents have belonged to fraternities. Many more thousands of American men count their fraternal experience\u2014and the friendships made within it\u2014as among the most valuable in their lives. The organizations raise millions of dollars for worthy causes, contribute millions of hours in community service, and seek to steer young men toward lives of service and honorable action. They also have a long, dark history of violence against their own members and visitors to their houses, which makes them in many respects at odds with the core mission of college itself. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lawsuits against fraternities are becoming a growing matter of public interest, in part because they record such lurid events, some of them ludicrous, many more of them horrendous. For every butt bomb, there\u2019s a complaint of manslaughter, rape, sexual torture, psychological trauma. A recent series of articles on fraternities by Bloomberg News\u2019s David Glovin and John Hechinger notes that since 2005, more than 60 people\u2014the majority of them students\u2014have died in incidents linked to fraternities, a sobering number in itself, but one that is dwarfed by the numbers of serious injuries, assaults, and sexual crimes that regularly take place in these houses. Many people believe that violent hazing is the most dangerous event associated with fraternity life, but hazing causes a relatively small percentage of these injuries. Because of a variety of forces, all this harm\u2014and the behaviors that lead to it\u2014has lately been moving out of the shadows of private disciplinary hearings and silent suffering, and into the bright light of civil lawsuits, giving us a clear picture of some of the more forbidding truths about fraternity life. While many of these suits never make it to trial, disappearing into confidential settlements (as did that of Louis Helmburg III, nearly two years after he filed his lawsuit) or melting away once plaintiffs recognize the powerful and monolithic forces they are up against, the narratives they leave behind in their complaints\u2014all of them matters of public record\u2014comprise a rich and potent testimony to the kinds of experiences regularly taking place on college campuses. Tellingly, the material facts of these complaints are rarely in dispute; what is contested, most often, is only liability. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Far from being freakish and unpredictable events, fatal and near-fatal falls from fraternity-house roofs, balconies, windows, and sleeping porches are fairly regular occurrences across the country. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I have spent most of the past year looking deeply into the questions posed by these lawsuits, and more generally into the particular nature of fraternity life on the modern American campus. Much of what I found challenged my beliefs about the system, assumptions that I came to see as grossly outdated, not because the nature of fraternity life has changed so much, but rather because life at the contemporary university has gone through such a profound transformation in the past quarter century. I found that the ways in which the system exerts its power\u2014and maintains its longevity\u2014in the face of the many potentially antagonistic priorities in contemporary higher education commanded my grudging respect. Fraternity tradition at its most essential is rooted in a set of old, deeply American, morally unassailable convictions, some of which\u2014such as a young man\u2019s right to the freedom of association\u2014emanate from the Constitution itself. In contrast, much of the policy governing college campuses today is rooted in the loose soil of a set of political and social fashions that change with the season, and that tend not to hold up to any kind of penetrating challenge. And this is why\u2014to answer the vexing question \u201cwhy don\u2019t colleges just get rid of their bad fraternities?\u201d\u2014the system, and its individual frats, have only grown in power and influence. Indeed, in many substantive ways, fraternities are now mightier than the colleges and universities that host them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The entire multibillion-dollar, 2,000-campus American college system\u2014with its armies of salaried professors, administrators, librarians, bursars, secretaries, admissions officers, alumni liaisons, development-office workers, coaches, groundskeepers, janitors, maintenance workers, psychologists, nurses, trainers, technology-support staffers, residence-life personnel, cafeteria workers, diversity-compliance officers, the whole shebang\u2014depends overwhelmingly for its very existence on one resource: an ever-renewing supply of fee-paying undergraduates. It could never attract hundreds of thousands of them each year\u2014many of them woefully unprepared for the experience, a staggering number (some 40 percent) destined never to get a degree, more than 60 percent of them saddled with student loans that they very well may carry with them to their deathbeds\u2014if the experience were not accurately marketed as a blast. They show up on campus lugging enormous Bed Bath & Beyond bags crammed with \u201cessentials,\u201d and with new laptop computers, on which they will surf Facebook and Tumblr while some coot down at the lectern bangs on about Maslow\u2019s hierarchy and tries to make his PowerPoint slides appear right side up. Many of these consumer goods have been purchased with money from the very student loans that will haunt them for so long, but no matter: it\u2019s college; any cost can be justified. The kids arrive eager to hurl themselves upon the pasta bars and the climbing walls, to splash into the 12-person Jacuzzis and lounge around the outdoor fire pits, all of which have been constructed in a blatant effort to woo them away from competitors. They swipe prepaid cards in dormitory vending machines to acquire whatever tanning wipes or earbuds or condoms or lube or energy drinks the occasion seems to require. And every moment of the experience is sweetened by the general understanding that with each kegger and rager, each lazy afternoon spent snoozing on the quad (a forgotten highlighter slowly drying out on the open pages of Introduction to Economics, a Coke Zero sweating beside it), they are actively engaged in the most significant act of self-improvement available to an American young person: college! NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Phil Toledano NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That all of this fun is somehow as essential as the education itself\u2014is somehow part of a benevolent and ultimately edifying process of \u201cgrowing up\u201d\u2014is one of the main reasons so many parents who are themselves in rocky financial shape will make economically ruinous decisions to support a four-year-residential-college experience for their children. There are many thousands of American undergraduates whose economic futures (and those of their parents) would be far brighter if they knocked off some of their general-education requirements online, or at the local community college\u2014for pennies on the dollar\u2014before entering the Weimar Republic of traditional-college pricing. But college education, like weddings and funerals, tends to prompt irrational financial decision making, and so here we are. Add another pesto flavor to the pasta bar, Dean Roland! We just lost another kid to online ed! NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That pursuing a bachelor\u2019s degree might be something other than a deeply ascetic and generally miserable experience was once a preposterous idea. American colleges came into being with the express purpose of training young men for the ministry, a preparation that was marked by a chilly round of early risings, Greek and Latin recitations, religious study, and strict discipline meted out by a dour faculty\u2014along with expectations of both temperance and chastity. Hardly conditions that would augur the current trillion-dollar student-loan balloon that hovers over us like a pre-ignition Hindenburg. But sexual frustration and homiletics would not last forever as the hallmarks of American college life.

And that made them powerful. And if we rocked the boat, we could be shunned.\" Read the full story by Meghan McCarthy NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 1825, at Union College, in upstate New York (hardly a garden of earthly delights in the best of circumstances, but surely a gulag experience for those stuck at Union; imagine studying Thessalonians in the ass-cracking cold of a Schenectady February), a small group of young men came up with a creative act of rebellion against the fun-busters who had them down: the formation of a secret club, which they grandly named the Kappa Alpha Society. Word of the group spread, and a new kind of college institution was founded, and with it a brand-new notion: that going to college could include some pleasure. It was the American age of societies, and this new type fit right in. As Nicholas Syrett observes in his excellent history of white men\u2019s college fraternities, The Company He Keeps, these early fraternities were in every way a measure of their time. They combined the secret handshakes and passwords of small boys\u2019 clubs; the symbols and rituals of Freemasonry; the new national interest in Greek, as opposed to Roman, culture as a model for an emerging citizenry; and the popularity of literary societies, elements of which\u2013oratory, recitation, and the presentation of essays\u2014the early fraternities included. Fraternities also gave young college men a way of behaving and of thinking about themselves that quickly took on surprisingly modern dimensions. An 1857 letter that a Sigma Phi member named Jenkins Holland sent to one of his fraternity brothers suggests the new system was already hitting full stride: \u201cI did get one of the nicest pieces of ass some day or two ago.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR From the very beginning, fraternities were loathed by the grown-ups running colleges, who tried to banish them. But independence from overbearing faculties\u2014existing on a plane beyond the reach of discipline\u2014was, in large measure, the point of fraternity membership; far from fearing the opprobrium of their knock-kneed overlords, the young men relished and even courted it. When colleges tried to shut them down, fraternities asserted that any threat to men\u2019s membership in the clubs constituted an infringement of their right to freedom of association. It was, at best, a legally delicate argument, but it was a symbolically potent one, and it has withstood through the years. The powerful and well-funded political-action committee that represents fraternities in Washington has fought successfully to ensure that freedom-of-association language is included in all higher-education reauthorization legislation, thus \u201cdisallowing public Universities the ability to ban fraternities.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An 1857 letter that a Sigma Phi sent to one of his fraternity brothers suggests the new system was already hitting full stride: \u201cI did get one of the nicest pieces of ass some day or two ago.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Perhaps the best testament to the deep power of fraternities is how quickly and widely they spread. Soon after Gold Rush money began flowing into the newly established state of California\u2014giving rise to the improbable idea of building a great American university on the shores of the Pacific Ocean\u2014fraternity men staked their own claim: a campus in Berkeley had existed barely a year before the brothers of Phi Delta Theta arrived to initiate new members. The thing to remember about fraternities is that when Kappa Alpha was founded at Union, in all of the United States there were only 4,600 college students; fraternities exist as deeply in the groundwater of American higher education as religious study\u2014and have retained a far greater presence in the lives of modern students. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In fairly short order, a paradox began to emerge, one that exists to this day. While the fraternities continued to exert their independence from the colleges with which they were affiliated, these same colleges started to develop an increasingly bedeviling kind of interdependence with the accursed societies. To begin with, the fraternities involved themselves very deeply in the business of student housing, which provided tremendous financial savings to their host institutions, and allowed them to expand the number of students they could admit. Today, one in eight American students at four-year colleges lives in a Greek house, and a conservative estimate of the collective value of these houses across the country is $3 billion. Greek housing constitutes a troubling fact for college administrators (the majority of fraternity-related deaths occur in and around fraternity houses, over which the schools have limited and widely varying levels of operational oversight) and also a great boon to them (saving them untold millions of dollars in the construction and maintenance of campus-owned and -controlled dormitories).

At least one study has affirmed what had long been assumed: that fraternity men tend to be generous to their alma maters. Furthermore, fraternities provide colleges with unlimited social programming of a kind that is highly attractive to legions of potential students, most of whom are not applying to ivy-covered rejection factories, but rather to vast public institutions and obscure private colleges that are desperate for students. When Mom is trying\u2014against all better judgment\u2014to persuade lackluster Joe Jr. to go to college, she gets a huge assist when she drives him over to State and he gets an eyeful of frat row. Joe Jr. may be slow to grasp even the most elemental concepts of math and English (his first two years of expensive college study will largely be spent in remediation of the subjects he should have learned, for free, in high school), but one look at the Fiji house and he gets the message: kids are getting laid here; kids are having fun. Maybe he ought to snuff out the joint and take a second look at that application Mom keeps pushing across the kitchen table. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Will he be in increased physical jeopardy if he joins one of these clubs? The fraternity industry says no. When confronted with evidence of student injury and death in their houses, fraternities claim they are no worse than any other campus group; that they have become \u201ctarget defendants,\u201d prey to the avarice of tort lawyers excited by their many assets and extensive liability coverage. It is true that fraternity lawsuits tend to involve at least one, and often more, of the four horsemen of the student-life apocalypse, a set of factors that exist far beyond frat row and that are currently bringing college presidents to their knees. First and foremost of these is the binge-drinking epidemic, which anyone outside the problem has a hard time grasping as serious (everyone drinks in college!) and which anyone with knowledge of the current situation understands as a lurid and complicated disaster. The second is the issue of sexual assault of female undergraduates by their male peers, a subject of urgent importance but one that remains stubbornly difficult even to quantify, let alone rectify, although it absorbs huge amounts of student interest, outrage, institutional funding, and\u2014increasingly\u2014federal attention. The third is the growing pervasiveness of violent hazing on campus, an art form that reaches its apogee at fraternities, but that has lately spread to all sorts of student groups. And the fourth is the fact that Boomers, who in their own days destroyed the doctrine of in loco parentis so that they could party in blissful, unsupervised freedom, have grown up into the helicopter parents of today, holding fiercely to a pair of mutually exclusive desires: on the one hand that their kids get to experience the same unfettered personal freedoms of college that they remember so fondly, and on the other that the colleges work hard to protect the physical and emotional well-being of their precious children. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But it\u2019s impossible to examine particular types of campus calamity and not find that a large number of them cluster at fraternity houses. Surely they have cornered the market in injuries to the buttocks. The number of lawsuits that involve paddling gone wrong, or branding that necessitated skin grafts, or a particular variety of sexual torture reserved for hazing and best not described in the gentle pages of this magazine, is astounding. To say nothing of the University of Tennessee frat boy who got dropped off, insensate, at the university hospital\u2019s emergency room and was originally assumed to be the victim of a sexual assault, and only later turned out to have damaged his rectum by allegedly pumping wine into it through an enema hose, as had his pals. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Or, to turn away from the buttocks, as surely a good number of fraternity men would be well advised to do, consider another type of fraternity injury: the tendency of brothers and their guests to get liquored up and fall off\u2014or out of\u2014the damn houses is a story in itself. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The campuses of Washington State University and the University of Idaho are located some eight miles apart in the vast agricultural region of the Northwest known as the Palouse. It was at the latter institution that the 19-year-old sophomore and newly minted Delta Delta Delta pledge Amanda Andaverde arrived in August of 2009, although she had scarcely moved into the Tri Delta house and registered for classes before she was at the center of events that would leave her with brain damage and cast her as the plaintiff in a major lawsuit filed on her behalf by her devastated parents. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It would have been an unremarkable Wednesday evening\u2014focused on the kind of partying and hooking up that are frequent pleasures of modern sorority women\u2014save for its hideous end. Andaverde and her sorority sisters began the night at Sigma Chi, where the \u201csorority ladies\u201d drank alcohol and spent the evening with \u201cdates\u201d they had been assigned during a party game. (The language of Andaverde\u2019s legal complaint often seems couched in a combination of \u201950s lingo and polite euphemism, intended perhaps to preclude a conservative Idaho jury from making moralistic judgments about the plaintiff\u2019s behavior.) The charms of Andaverde\u2019s assigned date ran thin, apparently, because close to midnight, she left him and made her way over to the Sigma Alpha Epsilon house, where she quickly ended up on the third-floor sleeping porch. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Many fraternity houses, especially older ones, have sleeping porches\u2014sometimes called \u201ccold airs\u201d or \u201crack rooms\u201d\u2014typically located on the top floor of the buildings\u2019 gable ends. They are large rooms filled with bunks, some of which are stacked in triple tiers, and their large windows are often left open, even in the coldest months. Many fraternity members have exceedingly fond memories of their time on the porches, which they view\u2014like so many fraternity traditions\u2014as a simultaneously vexing and bonding experience. Although these group sleeping arrangements were once considered an impediment to a young man\u2019s sex life, the hookup culture, in which privacy is no longer a requirement of sexual activity, has changed that, and the sleeping-porch experience is once again coming into favor. For a variety of reasons, sleeping porches feature in a number of lawsuits, pointing to an astonishing fact: despite fraternity houses\u2019 position as de facto residence halls for so many American college students, safety features are decidedly spotty; about half of them don\u2019t even have fire sprinklers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That pursuing a bachelor\u2019s degree might be something other than a deeply ascetic and generally miserable experience was once a preposterous idea. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to the complaint, shortly after arriving at SAE, Andaverde ran into a friend of hers, and he took her up to the sleeping porch, where he introduced her to a pal of his named Joseph Cody Cook. Andaverde and Cook talked, then climbed into Cook\u2019s bunk, where the two began kissing. It is at this point that the language of the suit finally frees itself of euphemism and reveals the fearsome power of the unambiguous, declarative sentence: \u201cAmanda rolled onto her shoulder toward the exterior wall, and suddenly, quickly, and unexpectedly dropped off Cook\u2019s mattress into the open exterior window, falling from the third-floor \u2018sleeping porch\u2019 to the cement approximately 25 feet below.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The injuries were devastating and included permanent brain injury. Andaverde was airlifted to a trauma center in Seattle, where she remained for many weeks; in the early days of her care, it seemed she might not survive. Eventually, however, she improved enough to leave the hospital and was transferred to a series of rehabilitation centers, where she spent many months learning to regain basic functions. Police, interviewed about the case, defended themselves the way police departments in college towns all over the country reasonably defend themselves when accused of not preventing a fraternity-house disaster: \u201cWe just can\u2019t send undercover people into private houses or private parties,\u201d said David Duke, the Moscow, Idaho, assistant chief of police. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Local news outlets covered Andaverde\u2019s plight widely and sympathetically, although the optimism with which her \u201cmiraculous\u201d recovery was celebrated was perhaps exaggerated. A television news report dedicated to that miracle revealed a young woman who, while she had escaped death, had clearly been grievously injured. As the reporter interviewed her mother, Andaverde sat in a wheelchair. When her hands were not propped on a black lap tray latched to the chair, she struggled to grasp a crayon and run it across the pages of a children\u2019s coloring book, or to place the six large pieces of a simple puzzle\u2014square, triangle, circle\u2014into their spaces. She eventually improved from this desperate state\u2014learning to walk and dress herself\u2014but she was a far cry from the student of veterinary medicine she had once been. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The local inclinations to see a badly injured college student as a figure deserving of community support, and to view even a limited recovery as evidence of the goodness of God, are not unaligned with regional preferences for self-reliance and for taking responsibility for one\u2019s own actions, however dire the consequences. The inevitable court case\u2014in which the Andaverde family named not only SAE and Tri Delta as defendants, but also the University of Idaho and the Idaho State Board of Education\u2014was dismissed on summary judgment because there was no dispute that Andaverde fell out of an open window, and because there was no evidence of an inherently dangerous condition in the house: that the window was open was obvious to anyone who walked into the room. The court determined that no other person or institution had a duty to protect Amanda from the actions and decisions\u2014the decision to drink alcohol, as a minor; the decision to climb into a bunk bed; the impulse to roll over\u2014that led to her accident. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Phil Toledano NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Andaverde\u2019s case seemed to me to be an isolated tragedy, until I sent away to the Latah County courthouse for a copy of the complaint and discovered within it this sentence: \u201cAmanda\u2019s fall was the second fall of a student from an upper-story fraternity house window at the University of Idaho within approximately a two-week period.\u201d This struck me as an astonishing coincidence. I looked into the matter and found that, indeed, a 20-year-old man named Shane Meyer had fallen from the third-floor window of the Delta Tau Delta house just 12 days before Andaverde\u2019s fall from SAE; not surprisingly, the police reported that \u201calcohol may have been a factor.\u201d He, too, had been airlifted to Seattle, and incredibly, the two fought for their lives in the same critical-care unit at Harborview Medical Center. I became intrigued by this kind of injury and began to do some more checking into the subject. I discovered that two months after Andaverde\u2019s fall, a 20-year-old student at Washington State\u2014\u201cquite intoxicated,\u201d in the laconic assessment of a local cop\u2014pitched forward and fell from a third-floor window of Alpha Kappa Lambda, escaping serious injury when his fall was broken by an SUV parked below. That these three events were not greeted on either campus by any kind of clamoring sense of urgency\u2014that they were, rather, met with a resigned sort of \u201chere we go again\u201d attitude by campus administrators and with what appeared to be the pro forma appointment of an investigative task force\u2014sparked my interest, and so it was that I entered the bizarre world of falls from fraternity houses, which, far from being freakish and unpredictable events, are in fact fairly regular occurrences across the country. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR During the 2012\u201313 school year on the Palouse\u2014where students from the two campuses often share apartments and attend parties at each other\u2019s schools\u2014the falls continued. In September, a student suffered serious injuries after falling off the roof of the Alpha Tau Omega house at the University of Idaho, and two days later a Washington State student fell three stories from a window at Phi Kappa Tau. In November, a 19-year-old suffered critical head injuries when he fell backwards off a second-floor balcony at the Washington State Lambda Chi Alpha house, necessitating the surgical removal of part of his skull. In April, a University of Idaho student named Krysta Huft filed a suit against the Delta Chi fraternity, seeking damages for a broken pelvis resulting from a 2011 fall, which she claims was from the house\u2019s third-story sleeping porch onto a basketball court beneath it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I decided to widen my search, and quickly discovered that this is not a phenomenon particular to the Northwest. Across the country, kids fall\u2014disastrously\u2014from the upper heights of fraternity houses with some regularity. They tumble from the open windows they are trying to urinate out of, slip off roofs, lose their grasp on drainpipes, misjudge the width of fire-escape landings. On February 25, 2012, a student at the University of California at Berkeley attempted to climb down the drainpipe of the Phi Gamma Delta house, fell, and suffered devastating injuries; on April 14 of the same year, a 21-year-old student at Gannon University, in Pennsylvania, died after a fall from the second-floor balcony of the Alpha Phi Delta house the night before; on May 13, a Cornell student was airlifted to a trauma center after falling from the fire escape at Delta Chi; on October 13, a student at James Madison University fell from the roof of the three-story Delta Chi house and was airlifted to the University of Virginia hospital; on December 1, a 19-year-old woman fell eight feet from the Sigma Alpha Mu house at Penn State. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This summer brought little relief. On July 13, a man fell more than 30 feet from a third-story window at the Theta Delta Chi house at the University of Washington and was transported to Harborview Medical Center (which must by now be developing a subspecialty in such injuries); that same day, a Dartmouth College employee, apparently having consumed LSD and marijuana, fell out of a second-story window of the Sigma Nu house and was seriously injured. On August 13, a student at the University of Oklahoma fell face-first off a balcony of the SAE house; the next day, a woman fell from a second-story fire escape at Phi Kappa Tau at Washington State University. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The current school year began, and still the falls continued. In September, a student at Washington State fell down a flight of stairs in the Delta Chi house and was rendered unconscious; a University of Minnesota student was hospitalized after falling off a second-floor balcony of the Phi Kappa Psi house; a Northwestern student was listed in critical condition after falling out of a third-floor window of the Phi Gamma Delta house; and an MIT student injured his head and genitals after falling through a skylight at the Phi Sigma Kappa house and landing some 40 feet below. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR These falls, of course, are in addition to the many other kinds of havoc and tragedy associated with fraternities. On the Palouse, such incidents include the January 2013 death of 18-year-old Joseph Wiederrick, a University of Idaho freshman who had made the dean\u2019s list his first semester, and who had plans to become an architect. He had attended a party at SAE (of which he was not a member) and then wandered, apparently drunk and lost, for five miles before freezing to death under a bridge. They also include the March 2013 conviction of Jesse M. Vierstra, who, while visiting Sigma Chi over the University of Idaho\u2019s homecoming weekend, raped an 18-year-old freshman in the bushes outside the house. (He is appealing the decision.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The notion that fraternities are target defendants did not hold true in my investigation. College students can (and do) fall out of just about any kind of residence, of course. But during the period of time under consideration, serious falls from fraternity houses on the two Palouse campuses far outnumbered those from other types of student residences, including privately owned apartments occupied by students. I began to view Amanda Andaverde\u2019s situation in a new light. Why are so many colleges allowing students to live and party in such unsafe locations? And why do the lawsuits against fraternities for this kind of serious injury and death\u2014so predictable and so preventable\u2014have such a hard time getting traction? The answers lie in the recent history of fraternities and the colleges and universities that host them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR from the archives The Hazards of Duke \"With a social scene dominated by fraternities and sororities (a way of life consisting of ardent partying and hooking up, offset by spurts of busywork composing angry letters to campus newspapers and taking online alcohol-education classes), ... [Duke] is a university whose thoughtful students are overshadowed by its voraciously self-centered ones.\" Read the full story by Caitlin Flanagan in the Jan/Feb 2011 issue. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What all of these lawsuits ultimately concern is a crucially important question in higher education, one that legal scholars have been grappling with for the past half century. This question is perhaps most elegantly expressed in the subtitle of Robert D. Bickel and Peter F. Lake\u2019s authoritative 1999 book on the subject, The Rights and Responsibilities of the Modern University: Who Assumes the Risks of College Life? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The answer to this question has been steadily evolving ever since the 1960s, when dramatic changes took place on American campuses, changes that affected both a university\u2019s ability to control student behavior and the status of fraternities in the undergraduate firmament. During this period of student unrest, the fraternities\u2014long the unquestioned leaders in the area of sabotaging or ignoring the patriarchal control of school administrators\u2014became the exact opposite: representatives of the very status quo the new activists sought to overthrow. Suddenly their beer bashes and sorority mixers, their panty raids and obsession with the big game, seemed impossibly reactionary when compared with the mind-altering drugs being sampled in off-campus apartments where sexual liberation was being born and the Little Red Book proved, if nothing else, a fantastic coaster for a leaky bong. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR American students sought to wrest themselves entirely from the disciplinary control of their colleges and universities, institutions that had historically operated in loco parentis, carefully monitoring the private behavior of undergraduates. The students of the new era wanted nothing to do with that infantilizing way of existence, and fought to rid themselves of the various curfews, dorm mothers, demerit systems, and other modes of institutional oppression. If they were old enough to die in Vietnam, powerful enough to overthrow a president, groovy enough to expand their minds with LSD and free love, then they certainly didn\u2019t need their own colleges\u2014the very places where they were forming their radical, nation-changing ideas\u2014to treat them like teenyboppers in need of a sock hop and a chaperone. It was a turning point: American colleges began to regard their students not as dependents whose private lives they must shape and monitor, but as adult consumers whose contract was solely for an education, not an upbringing. The doctrine of in loco parentis was abolished at school after school. Through it all, fraternities\u2014for so long the repositories of the most outrageous behavior\u2014moldered, all but forgotten. Membership fell sharply, fraternity houses slid into increasing states of disrepair, and hundreds of chapters closed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Animal House, released in 1978, at once predicted and to no small extent occasioned the roaring return of fraternity life that began in the early \u201980s and that gave birth to today\u2019s vital Greek scene. The casting of John Belushi was essential to the movie\u2019s influence: no one had greater credibility in the post-\u201960s youth culture. If something as fundamentally reactionary as fraternity membership was going to replace something as fundamentally radical as student unrest, it would need to align itself with someone whose bona fides among young, white, middle-class males were unassailable. In this newly forming culture, the drugs and personal liberation of the \u201960s would be paired with the self-serving materialism of the \u201980s, all of which made partying for its own sake\u2014and not as a philosophical adjunct to solving some complicated problem in Southeast Asia\u2014a righteous activity for the pampered young collegian. Fraternity life was reborn with a vengeance. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It was an entirely new kind of student who arrived at the doors of those great and crumbling mansions: at once deeply attracted to the ceremony and formality of fraternity life and yet utterly transformed by the social revolutions of the past decades. These new members and their countless guests brought with them hard drugs, new and ever-developing sexual attitudes, and a stunningly high tolerance for squalor (never had middle- and upper-middle-class American young people lived in such filth as did \u201960s and \u201970s college kids who were intent on rejecting their parents\u2019 bourgeois ways). Furthermore, in 1984 Congress passed the National Minimum Drinking Age Act, with the ultimate result of raising the legal drinking age to 21 in all 50 states. This change moved college partying away from bars and college-sponsored events and toward private houses\u2014an ideal situation for fraternities. When these advances were combined with the evergreen fraternity traditions of violent hazing and brawling among rival frats, the scene quickly became wildly dangerous. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Adult supervision was nowhere to be found. Colleges had little authority to intervene in what took place in the personal lives of its students visiting private property. Fraternities, eager to provide their members with the independence that is at the heart of the system\u2014and responsive to members\u2019 wish for the same level of freedom that non-Greek students enjoyed\u2014had largely gotten rid of the live-in resident advisers who had once provided some sort of check on the brothers. With these conditions in place, lawsuits began to pour in. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR No sooner has a national fraternity rolled out a new \u201cMen of Principle\u201d or \u201cTrue Gentlemen\u201d campaign than reports of a lurid disaster in some prominent or far-flung chapter undermine the whole thing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The mid-1980s were a treacherous time to be the defendant in a tort lawsuit. Personal-injury cases had undergone a long shift to the plaintiff\u2019s advantage; the theory of comparative negligence\u2014by which an individual can acknowledge his or her own partial responsibility for an injury yet still recover damages from a defendant\u2014had become the standard; the era of huge jury verdicts was at hand. Americans in vast numbers\u2014motivated perhaps in part by the possibility of financial recompense, and in part by a new national impetus to move personal suffering from the sphere of private sorrow to that of public confession and complaint\u2014began to sue those who had damaged them. Many fraternity lawsuits listed the relevant college or university among the defendants, a practice still common among less experienced plaintiff\u2019s attorneys. These institutions possess deep reservoirs of liability coverage, but students rarely recover significant funds from their schools. As Amanda Andaverde\u2019s attorneys discovered the hard way, a great deal of time and money can be spent seeking damages from institutions of higher learning, which can be protected by everything from sovereign immunity and damage caps (in the case of public universities), to their limited ability to monitor the private behavior of their students. But for the fraternities themselves, it was a far different story. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So recently and robustly brought back to life, the fraternities now faced the most serious threat to their existence they had ever experienced. A single lawsuit had the potential to devastate a fraternity. In 1985, a young man grievously injured in a Kappa Alpha\u2013related accident reached a settlement with the fraternity that, over the course of his lifetime, could amount to some $21 million\u2014a sum that caught the attention of everyone in the Greek world. Liability insurance became both ruinously expensive and increasingly difficult to obtain. The insurance industry ranked American fraternities as the sixth-worst insurance risk in the country\u2014just ahead of toxic-waste-removal companies. \u201cYou guys are nuts,\u201d an insurance representative told a fraternity CEO in 1989, just before canceling the organization\u2019s coverage; \u201cyou can\u2019t operate like this much longer.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For fraternities to survive, they needed to do four separate but related things: take the task of acquiring insurance out of the hands of the local chapters and place it in the hands of the vast national organizations; develop procedures and policies that would transfer as much of their liability as possible to outside parties; find new and creative means of protecting their massive assets from juries; and\u2014perhaps most important of all\u2014find a way of indemnifying the national and local organizations from the dangerous and illegal behavior of some of their undergraduate members. The way fraternities accomplished all of this is the underlying story in the lawsuits they face, and it is something that few members\u2014and, I would wager, even fewer parents of members\u2014grasp completely, comprising a set of realities you should absolutely understand in detail if your son ever decides to join a fraternity. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Self-insurance was an obvious means for combating prohibitive insurance pricing and the widening reluctance to insure fraternities. In 1992, four fraternities created what was first called the Fraternity Risk Management Trust, a vast sum of money used for reinsurance. Today, 32 fraternities belong to this trust. In 2006, a group of seven other fraternities bought their own insurance broker, James R. Favor, which now insures many others. More important than self-insurance, however, was the development of a risk-management policy that would become\u2014across these huge national outfits and their hundreds of individual chapters\u2014the industry standard. This was accomplished by the creation of something called the Fraternal Information and Programming Group (FIPG), which in the mid-1980s developed a comprehensive risk-management policy for fraternities that is regularly updated. Currently 32 fraternities are members of the FIPG and adhere to this policy, or to their own even more rigorous versions. One fraternity expert told me that even non-FIPG frats have similar policies, many based in large measure on FIPG\u2019s, which is seen as something of a blueprint. In a certain sense, you may think you belong to Tau Kappa Epsilon or Sigma Nu or Delta Tau Delta\u2014but if you find yourself a part of life-changing litigation involving one of those outfits, what you really belong to is FIPG, because its risk-management policy (and your adherence to or violation of it) will determine your fate far more than the vows you made during your initiation ritual\u2014vows composed by long-dead men who had never even heard of the concept of fraternity insurance. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR FIPG regularly produces a risk-management manual\u2014the current version is 50 pages\u2014that lays out a wide range of (optional) best practices. If the manual were Anna Karenina, alcohol policy would be its farming reform: the buzz-killing subplot that quickly reveals itself to be an authorial obsession. For good reason: the majority of all fraternity insurance claims involve booze\u2014I have read hundreds of fraternity incident reports, not one of which describes an event where massive amounts of alcohol weren\u2019t part of the problem\u2014and the need to manage or transfer risk presented by alcohol is perhaps the most important factor in protecting the system\u2019s longevity. Any plaintiff\u2019s attorney worth his salt knows how to use relevant social-host and dramshop laws against a fraternity; to avoid this kind of liability, the fraternity needs to establish that the young men being charged were not acting within the scope of their status as fraternity members. Once they violated their frat\u2019s alcohol policy, they parted company with the frat. It\u2019s a neat piece of logic: the very fact that a young man finds himself in need of insurance coverage is often grounds for denying it to him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So: alcohol and the fraternity man. Despite everything you may think you know about life on frat row, there are actually only two FIPG-approved means of serving drinks at a frat party. The first is to hire a third-party vendor who will sell drinks and to whom some liability\u2014most significant, that of checking whether drinkers are of legal age\u2014will be transferred. The second and far more common is to have a BYO event, in which the liability for each bottle of alcohol resides solely in the person who brought it. If you think this is in any way a casual system, then you have never read either the FIPG risk-management manual or its sister publication, an essay written in the surrealist vein titled \u201cMaking Bring Your Own Beverage Events Happen.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The official byo system is like something dreamed up by a committee of Soviet bureaucrats and Irish nuns. It begins with the composition\u2014no fewer than 24 hours before the party\u2014of a comprehensive guest list. This guest list does not serve the happy function of ensuring a perfect mix of types and temperaments at the festivity; rather, it limits attendance\u2014and ensures that the frat is in possession of \u201ca witness list in the event something does occur which may end up in court two or more years later.\u201d Provided a fraternity member\u2014let\u2019s call him Larry\u2014is older than 21 (which the great majority of members, like the great majority of all college students, are not), he is allowed to bring six (and no more) beers or four (and no more) wine coolers to the party. (FIPG\u2019s admiration for the wine-cooler four-pack suggests that at least some aspects of the foundational document\u2014including its recommendation for throwing a M*A*S*H-themed party as recently as 2007\u2014have not received much of an overhaul since its first edition, published in the mid\u2011\u201980s.) Okay, so Larry brings a six-pack. The first stop, depending on which fraternity he belongs to: a \u201csober check point,\u201d at which he is subjected to an examination. Does he appear to have already consumed any alcohol? Is he in any way \u201cknown\u201d to have done so? If he passes, he hands over his ID for inspection. Next he must do business with a \u201csober monitor.\u201d This person relieves him of the six-pack, hands him a ticket indicating the precise type of beer he brought, and ideally affixes a \u201cnon breakable except by cutting\u201d wristband to his person; only then can Larry retrieve his beers, one at a time, for his own personal consumption. If any are left over at the end of the party, his fraternity will secure them until the next day, when Larry can be reunited with his unconsumed beers, unless his frat decided to \u201celiminate\u201d them overnight. Weaknesses in the system include the fact that all of these people coming between Larry and his beer\u2014the sober monitors and ID checkers and militarized barkeeps\u2014are Larry\u2019s fraternity brothers, who are among his closest buddies and who have pledged him lifelong fealty during candlelit ceremonies rife with Masonic mumbo jumbo and the fluttering language of 19th-century romantic friendship. Note also that these policies make it possible for fraternities to be the one industry in the country in which every aspect of serving alcohol can be monitored and managed by people who are legally too young to drink it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR During a crisis, the questionnaires and honest accounts that fraternity members submit gratefully to their national organization may return to haunt many of the brothers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Clearly, a great number of fraternity members will, at some point in their undergraduate career, violate their frat\u2019s alcohol policy regarding the six beers\u2014and just as clearly, the great majority will never face any legal consequences for doing so. But when the inevitable catastrophes do happen, that policy can come to seem more like a cynical hoax than a real-world solution to a serious problem. When something terrible takes place\u2014a young man plummets from a roof, a young woman is assaulted, a fraternity brother is subjected to the kind of sexual sadism that appears all too often in fraternity lawsuits\u2014any small violation of policy can leave fraternity members twisting in the wind. Consider the following scenario: Larry makes a small, human-size mistake one night. Instead of waiting for the slow drip of six warm beers, he brings a bottle of Maker\u2019s Mark to the party, and\u2014in the spirit of not being a weirdo or a dick\u2014he shares it, at one point pouring a couple of ounces into the passing Solo cup of a kid who\u2019s running on empty and asks him for a shot. Larry never sees the kid again that night\u2014not many people do; he ends up drinking himself to death in an upstairs bedroom. In the sad fullness of time, the night\u2019s horror is turned into a lawsuit, in which Larry becomes a named defendant. Thanks in part to the guest/witness list, Larry can be cut loose, both from the expensive insurance he was required to help pay for (by dint of his dues) as a precondition of membership, and from any legal defense paid for by the organization. What will happen to Larry now? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gentle reader, if you happen to have a son currently in a college fraternity, I would ask that you take several carbon dioxide\u2013rich deep breaths from a paper bag before reading the next paragraph. I\u2019ll assume you are sitting down. Ready? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cI\u2019ve recovered millions and millions of dollars from homeowners\u2019 policies,\u201d a top fraternal plaintiff\u2019s attorney told me. For that is how many of the claims against boys who violate the strict policies are paid: from their parents\u2019 homeowners\u2019 insurance. As for the exorbitant cost of providing the young man with a legal defense for the civil case (in which, of course, there are no public defenders), that is money he and his parents are going to have to scramble to come up with, perhaps transforming the family home into an ATM to do it. The financial consequences of fraternity membership can be devastating, and they devolve not on the 18-year-old \u201cman\u201d but on his planning-for-retirement parents. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Like the six-beer policy, the Fraternal Information and Programming Group\u2019s chillingly comprehensive crisis-management plan was included in its manual for many years. But in 2013, the plan suddenly disappeared from its pages. When asked why this was so, Dave Westol, a longtime FIPG board member, said, \u201cMember organizations prefer to establish their own procedures, and therefore the section has been eliminated.\u201d However, many fraternities continue to rely on the group\u2019s advice for in-house risk management, and it is well worth examining if you want to know what takes place in the hours following many fraternity disasters. As it is described in the two most recent editions that I was able to obtain (2003 and 2007), the plan serves a dual purpose, at once benevolent and mercenary. The benevolent part is accomplished by the clear directive that injured parties are to receive immediate medical attention, and that all fraternity brothers who come into contact with the relevant emergency workers are to be completely forthright about what has taken place. And the rest? The plans I obtained recommend six important steps: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 1. In the midst of the horror, the chapter president takes immediate, commanding, and inspiring control of the situation: \u201cIn times of stress, leaders step forward.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 2. A call is made to the fraternity\u2019s crisis hotline or the national headquarters, no matter the hour: \u201cSomeone will be available. They would much rather hear about a situation from you at 3:27 a.m. than receive an 8:01 a.m. telephone call from a reporter asking for a comment about \u2018The situation involving your chapter at ____.\u2019 \u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 3. The president closes the fraternity house to outsiders and summons all members back to the house: \u201cUnorthodox situations call for unorthodox responses from leaders. Most situations occur at night. Therefore, be prepared to call a meeting of all members and all pledged members as soon as possible, even if that is at 3 a.m.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 4. One member\u2014who has already received extensive media training\u2014is put in charge of all relations with the press, an entity fraternities view as biased and often unscrupulous. The appointed member should be prepared to present a concise, factual, and minimally alarming account of what took place. For example: \u201cA new member was injured at a social event.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 5. In the case of the death of a guest or a member, fraternity brothers do not attempt direct contact with the deceased\u2019s parents. This hideous task is to be left to the impersonal forces of the relevant professionals. (I know of one family who did not know their son was in any kind of trouble until\u2014many hours after his death, and probably long after his fraternity brothers had initiated the crisis-management protocol\u2014their home phone rang and the caller ID came up with the area code of their boy\u2019s college and a single word: coroner). If the dead person was a fraternity member who lived in the house, his brothers should return any borrowed items to his room and temporarily relocate his roommate, if he had one. Members may offer to pack up his belongings, but \u201cit is more likely the family will want to do this themselves.\u201d Several empty boxes might thoughtfully be left outside the room for this purpose. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 6. Members sit tight until consultants from the national organization show up to take control of the situation and to walk them through the next steps, which often include the completion of questionnaires explaining exactly what happened and one-on-one interviews with the fraternity representatives. The anxious brothers are reminded to be completely honest and forthcoming in these accounts, and to tell the folks from national absolutely everything they know so that the situation can be resolved in the best possible manner. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As you should by now be able to see very clearly, the interests of the national organization and the individual members cleave sharply as this crisis-management plan is followed. Those questionnaires and honest accounts\u2014submitted gratefully to the grown-ups who have arrived, the brothers believe, to help them\u2014may return to haunt many of the brothers, providing possible cause for separating them from the fraternity, dropping them from the fraternity\u2019s insurance, laying the blame on them as individuals and not on the fraternity as the sponsoring organization. Indeed, the young men who typically rush so gratefully into the open arms of the representatives from their beloved national\u2014an outfit to which they have pledged eternal allegiance\u2014would be far better served by not talking to them at all, by walking away from the chapter house as quickly as possible and calling a lawyer. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The financial consequences of fraternity membership can be devastating, and they devolve not on the 18-year-old \u201cman\u201d but on his planning-for-retirement parents. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So here is the essential question: In the matter of these disasters, are fraternities acting in an ethical manner, requiring good behavior from their members and punishing them soundly for bad or even horrific decisions? Or are they keeping a cool distance from the mayhem, knowing full well that misbehavior occurs with regularity (\u201cmost events take place at night\u201d) and doing nothing about it until the inevitable tragedy occurs, at which point they cajole members into incriminating themselves via a crisis-management plan presented as being in their favor? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The opposing positions on this matter are held most forcefully and expressed most articulately by two men: Douglas Fierberg, the best plaintiff\u2019s attorney in the country when it comes to fraternity-related litigation, and Peter Smithhisler, the CEO of the North-American Interfraternity Conference, a trade organization representing 75 fraternities, among them all 32 members of the Fraternal Information and Programming Group. In a parallel universe, the two men would be not adversaries but powerful allies, for they have much in common: both are robust midwesterners in the flush of vital middle age and at the zenith of their professional powers; both possess more dark knowledge of college-student life and collegiate binge drinking than many, if not most, of the experts hired to study and quantify the phenomenon; both have built careers devoted to the lives and betterment of young people. But two roads diverged in the yellow wood, and here we are. One man is an avenger, a gun for hire, a person constitutionally ill-prepared to lose a fight; the other is a conciliator, a patient explainer, a man ever willing to lift the flap of his giant tent and welcome you inside. I have had long and wide-ranging conversations with both men, in which each put forth his perspective on the situation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fierberg is a man of obvious and deep intelligence, comfortable\u2014in the way of alpha-male litigators\u2014with sharply correcting a fuzzy thought; with using obscenities; with speaking derisively, even contemptuously, of opponents. He is also the man I would run to as though my hair were on fire if I ever found myself in a legal battle with a fraternity, and so should you. In a year of reporting this story, I have not spoken with anyone outside of the fraternity system who possesses a deeper understanding of its inner workings; its closely guarded procedures and money trails; and the legal theories it has developed over the past three decades to protect itself, often very successfully, from lawsuits. Fierberg speaks frequently and openly with the press, and because of this\u2014and because of the reticence of senior members of the fraternity system to speak at length with meddlesome journalists\u2014the media often reflect his attitude. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For all these reasons, Fierberg is generally loathed by people at the top of the fraternity world, who see him as a money-hungry lawyer who has chosen to chase their particular ambulance, and whose professed zeal for reforming the industry is a sham: what he wants is his share of huge damages, not systemic changes that would cut off the money flow. But in my experience of him, this is simply not the case. Sure, he has built a lucrative practice. But he is clearly passionate about his cause and the plight of the kids\u2014some of them horribly injured, others dead\u2014who comprise his caseload, along with their shattered parents. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cUntil proven otherwise,\u201d Fierberg told me in April of fraternities, \u201cthey all are very risky organizations for young people to be involved in.\u201d He maintains that fraternities \u201care part of an industry that has tremendous risk and a tremendous history of rape, serious injury, and death, and the vast majority share common risk-management policies that are fundamentally flawed. Most of them are awash in alcohol. And most if not all of them are bereft of any meaningful adult supervision.\u201d As for the risk-management policies themselves: \u201cThey are primarily designed to take the nationals\u2019 fingerprints off the injury and deaths, and I don\u2019t believe that they offer any meaningful provisions.\u201d The fraternity system, he argues, is \u201cthe largest industry in this country directly involved in the provision of alcohol to underage people.\u201d The crisis-management plans reveal that in \u201cthe foreseeable future\u201d there may be \u201cthe death or serious injury\u201d of a healthy young person at a fraternity function. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Are fraternities acting in an ethical manner, requiring good behavior and punishing poor decisions? Or are they keeping a cool distance from the mayhem, knowing full well that it occurs with regularity? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And then there is Peter Smithhisler, who is the senior fraternity man ne plus ultra: unfailingly, sometimes elaborately courteous; careful in his choice of words; unflappable; and as unlikely to interrupt or drop the f-bomb on a respectful female journalist as he would be to join the Communist Party. He is the kind of man you would want on your side in a tough spot, the kind of man you would want mentoring your son through the challenging passage from late adolescence to young manhood. He believes that the fraternity experience at its best constitutes an appeal to a young man\u2019s better angels: through service, leadership training, and accountability for mistakes, a brother can learn the valuable lessons he will need to become \u201ca better dad, a better teacher, a better engineer, a better pilot, a better \u2018insert career here.\u2019\u201d Spend some time talking with Pete Smithhisler, and you can go from refusing to allow your son to join a fraternity to demanding he do so. Indeed, the day after I talked with him, I happened to be at a social gathering where I met two women whose sons had just graduated from college. \u201cThe fraternity was what saved him,\u201d one mother said with great feeling. Her son had waited until sophomore year to rush, and freshman year he had been so lonely and unsure of himself that she had become deeply worried about him. But everything changed after he pledged. He had friends; he was happy. When he\u2019d had to have some surgery while at school, his brothers had visited him almost around the clock, bringing him food, keeping up his spirits, checking in with his doctors and charming his nurses. \u201cIf only I could have gotten my son to join one,\u201d the other mom said, wistfully. \u201cI kept trying, but he wouldn\u2019t do it.\u201d Why had she wished he\u2019d pledged a fraternity? \u201cHe would have been so much more connected to the college,\u201d she said. \u201cHe would have had so many other opportunities.\u201d\n",
        "summary": "\u2013 Frat-house accidents and sexual assaults are getting so common they're impossible to ignore\u2014but how did it get this bad, and why does it keep happening? In an extensive Atlantic piece, Caitlin Flanagan looks at the history of fraternities and their myriad ways of avoiding legal obligations for what goes on behind closed doors. As Bloomberg reported, 60 students have died in frat-related incidents since 2005, a fact \"that is dwarfed by the numbers of serious injuries, assaults, and sexual crimes that regularly take place in these houses,\" writes Flanagan. She chronicles a few incidents, from a freshman girl's heinous rape at Wesleyan University to a young man who fired a bottle rocket out of his butt at Marshall University\u2014and the guy who fell off a deck videotaping it, and later sued Alpha Tau Omega for his injuries. To avoid financial ruin, fraternities have merged into \"vast national organizations\" that buy liability insurance, and they've created rules about alcohol consumption that are nearly impossible for party-lovers to follow\u2014so when the inevitable lawsuits come, frat members are considered at fault for breaking the rules. That means their soon-to-be-retired parents pay extensive legal bills, and parents' homeowners insurance often pays settlements. So why do universities allow this perilous environment to persist? Largely because fraternity dorms save schools \"untold millions of dollars\" in housing, writes Flanagan, and the frat-house party image helps lure students into expensive universities. To be fair, advocates also describe the positives\u2014like increased confidence, brotherhood, and leadership training. But parents should know the dangers: \"Until proven otherwise,\" a lawyer tells Flanagan, \"they all are very risky organizations for young people to be involved in.\" Click for her full piece.\n"

The memorial, the first on the Mall honoring an African American, has been a quarter-century in the making, but safety trumped ceremony. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hurricane Irene was forecast to sweep over the Outer Banks of North Carolina overnight Friday and advance into the Washington area with a vanguard of showers beginning Saturday afternoon. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Early Friday morning, the National Weather Service upgraded the Tropical Storm Watch issued for much of the D.C. area to a Tropical Storm Warning. Meanwhile, Irene weakened slightly to a Category 2 storm as it approached the East Coast, where a hurricane warning was also extended to New Jersey. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If the hurricane stays on track, the worst of Irene will arrive in Virginia, Maryland and the District later Saturday and into Sunday morning. Late-summer vacationers evacuated Atlantic coast beaches, which are expected to be hit hardest before the storm wallops New England.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The study suggests elephants, already known to be intelligent creatures, are even more sophisticated than previously believed when it comes to understanding human dangers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR African elephants (Loxodonta africana) are the largest land animals on Earth and are considered a vulnerable species due to habitat loss and illegal hunting for their ivory tusks. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Researchers played recordings of human voices for elephants at Amboseli National Park in Kenya to see how they would respond, according to a report in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some of the voices were from local Maasai men, a group that herds cattle and sometimes comes into conflict with elephants over access to water and grazing space. Occasionally, elephants are killed in clashes with Maasai men, and vice-versa. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Other recorded voices were from Kamba men, who tend to be farmers or employees of the national park, and who rarely represent a danger to elephants. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Still other voices tested on the elephants included female Maasai speakers and young boys. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR All were saying the same phrase: \u201cLook, look over there, a group of elephants is coming.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The recorded voices were played for hundreds of elephants across 47 family groups during daylight hours. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When elephants heard the adult male Maasai voices, they tended to gather together, start investigative smelling with their trunks, and move cautiously away. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But when elephants heard females, boys, or adult male Kamba speakers, they did not show concern. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR - Discriminating between languages - NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThe ability to distinguish between Maasai and Kamba men delivering the same phrase in their own language suggests that elephants can discriminate between different languages,\u201d said co-author Graeme Shannon, a visiting fellow in psychology at the University of Sussex. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That is not the same as understanding what the words mean, but still shows that elephants can decipher the more sing-songy Maasai language from the Kamba tongue, perhaps based on inflections, use of vowels, and other cues. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cIt is very sophisticated what the elephants are doing,\u201d said Keith Lindsay, a conservation biologist and member of the scientific advisory committee of the Amboseli Elephant Research Project. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cA lot of animals will take flight at just the general threat posed by people, but a smart animal doesn\u2019t do that,\u201d he told AFP. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cTheir response to hearing Maasai men talking was to be alert, to move away, but not to run away in total fear,\u201d added Lindsay, who was not involved in the study. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cIt is suggesting that elephants are capable of thinking, (of) recognizing that if Maasai men are talking, they are not likely to be hunting because if they were hunting, they would be quiet.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR - Wiser with age - NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Elephant groups with older matriarchs in their midst did best at assessing the threat from different speakers, further bolstering the presumed role of learning in the animals\u2019 behavior. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The elephants also did not act the same way as they did when recordings of lions were played, as was shown in a previous study. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In those scenarios, they bunched together so that juveniles \u2014 those most at risk from a lion attack \u2014 were in the center, and moved toward the sounds as if to scare the lion away. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When it comes to recognizing people, elephants may not be alone in this ability. Other research has suggested that wild bottlenose dolphins in Brazil have become so familiar with humans that they engage in cooperative hunting with artisanal fisherman. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Great apes, crows and even prairie dogs have also been shown to differentiate between humans on some level. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A separate study published last month in the journal PLoS ONE showed elephants even have specific alarm calls for when humans are near, suggesting the relationship between people and elephants has reached a troubling point and that conservation efforts are more important than ever. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cWe have become a formal enemy of the elephants,\u201d said Lori Marino, an expert on animal intelligence at Emory University. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThey can not only make some distinctions between us, but we are now on their list of species to watch out for.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR [Image via Agence France-Presse] ||||| WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Dr. Seuss had it right: Horton really does hear a Who. Wild elephants can distinguish between human languages, and they can tell whether a voice comes from a man, woman or boy, a new study says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This handout photo provided by the University of Sussex, taken in April 2011, shows a wild elephant in Amboseli National Park in Kenya reacting to sound played by scientists in experiments that show they... (Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That's what researchers found when they played recordings of people for elephants in Kenya. Scientists say this is an advanced thinking skill that other animals haven't shown. It lets elephants figure out who is a threat and who isn't. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The result shows that while humans are studying elephants, the clever animals are also studying people and drawing on their famed powers of memory, said study author Karen McComb. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Basically they have developed this very rich knowledge of the humans that they share their habitat with,\" said McComb , a professor of animal behavior and cognition at the University of Sussex in England. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Memory is key. They must build up that knowledge somehow.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The study was released Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It's close but not quite like the Dr. Seuss book, where the empathetic elephant Horton hears something that others can't hear. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McComb and colleagues went to Amboseli National Park in Kenya, where hundreds of wild elephants live among humans, sometimes coming in conflict over scarce water. The scientists used voice recordings of Maasai men, who on occasion kill elephants in confrontations over grazing for cattle, and Kamba men, who are less of a threat to the elephants. The recordings contained the same phrase in two different languages: \"Look over there. A group of elephants is coming.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By about a two-to-one margin, the elephants reacted defensively \u2014 retreating and gathering in a bunch \u2014 more to the Maasai language recording because it was associated with the more threatening human tribe, said study co-author Graeme Shannon of Colorado State University. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"They are making such a fine-level discrimination using human language skills,\" Shannon said. \"They're able to acquire quite detailed knowledge. The only way of doing this is with an exceptionally large brain.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They repeated the experiment with recordings of Maasai men and women. Since women almost never spear elephants, the animals reacted less to the women's voices. The same thing happened when they substituted young boys' voices. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Making this kind of fine distinctions in human voice patterns is quite remarkable,\" said Emory University animal cognition expert Frans de Waal, who was not part of the study. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While it shows quite a bit about elephant intelligence and adaptability, it also indicates a problem, said biologist Josh Plotnik, founder of Think Elephants International, a research and advocacy group. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This is both fascinating in that it supports evidence we already have that these animals are behaviorally quite flexible, but also sad because it suggests that the conflict between humans and elephants is growing,\" Plotnik, who was not part of the study, wrote in an email. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In yet another experiment McComb and Shannon altered female and male voices, making female voices sound male by lowering their tone and resonance, and males sound female by raising their pitches. Those kinds of changes fool most humans, but the clever elephants weren't tricked, McComb said. They still moved away from the altered male voices and not the altered female voices.

In a study at a Kenyan national park, researchers played recordings of different languages and voices for 47 elephant family groups, comprising hundreds of animals. The recordings included the voices of Maasai men, whose cattle-herding can cause run-ins with elephants. Kamba men, on the other hand, are often farmers or national park workers and present little danger to elephants, AFP reports via Raw Story. While the languages recorded were different, the spoken phrase was the same: \"Look, look over there\u2014a group of elephants is coming.\" When the elephants heard Maasai men, they prepared to protect themselves, sniffing around and moving together. But the voices of Kamba men didn't prompt much worry. \"They are making such a fine-level discrimination using human language skills,\" a study author tells the AP. \"They're able to acquire quite detailed knowledge.\" The elephants also appeared to be able to distinguish between men and women: Maasai women's voices didn't set off major alarm bells, nor did Maasai boys'.

The elevators in the building often malfunctioned and residents often used the stairs instead, even though the lights in the stairwells were frequently out, as they were that night. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Officer Liang, 27, was conducting a so-called vertical patrol with his partner, starting on the roof and heading down through the stairwells, a common procedure for officers assigned to housing projects. Officer Liang had his gun out and opened the door to a stairwell; the gun went off, authorities said, as Mr. Gurley entered the stairwell one floor below. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The police commissioner, William J.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A central question for the grand jury to consider, Professor Jones-Brown said, is \u201cwhat police are trained and authorized to do in these kinds of situations.\u201d If the police action goes against training and police guidelines, the next step would be to determine how much of the officer\u2019s behavior had diverged from \u201cthe kind of care he should\u2019ve been exercising,\u201d she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The investigation into the shooting so far has covered the first minutes after the officer shot Mr. Gurley, a law enforcement official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak about an ongoing case.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThat doesn\u2019t necessarily mean a conviction, but it should mean an indictment that allows the facts to be aired in a public trial,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen unarmed black men are killed by police officers, we need public trials to help restore confidence in the criminal justice system.\u201d\n",

A Brooklyn grand jury indicted Peter Liang, 27, on charges of second-degree manslaughter in the November shooting of Akai Gurley, 28, reports the Daily News. The charges essentially accuse Liang of acting recklessly, says the newspaper. Police have previously said that Liang's gun fired accidentally as he and a partner were patrolling a public housing complex and preparing to descend a dark staircase. The bullet struck Gurley, who was on a landing one floor below. \u201cThey didn\u2019t present themselves or nothing and shot him,\u201d Gurley's girlfriend, who lives in the building, told DNAInfo after the shooting. \u201cThey didn\u2019t identify themselves at all. They just shot.\u201d Liang, who has been on desk duty since the shooting, is expected to turn himself in tomorrow morning.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Duluth police say Ron Tarnowski, 82, and Mary Tarnowski, 78, were found on Saturday shortly before 4 p.m., after they were missing for eight days. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A U.S. Border Patrol Helicopter found their vehicle in a rural area about 150 yards off of Highway 2 in the Brookston, Minnesota area. St. Louis County Sheriff's Office Sgt. Wade Rasch says it appears the couple drove off the road onto a swampy trail that was likely only used as a snowmobile trail during the winter. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rasch said Mary Tarnowski was found in the car, which was stuck on the trail, and Ron Tarnowski was found closer to the highway. Rasch said it appears Ron went to get help after the car became stuck.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A post on the Find Ron and Mary Tarnowski Facebook page stated, \"It is with great sadness that we must report that Ron and Mary Tarnowski have been found deceased in a remote area about a mile from their hunting camp.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The couple had been last seen on surveillance video at a Country Corner store near Brookston, Minnesota, around 1 p.m. on Saturday, July 29. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ron had early-stage dementia, and Mary had right-sided paralysis, making it difficult to speak. ||||| After a week-long search, Ron and Mary Tarnowski were discovered dead in swampy area in Duluth on Aug. 5. The couple was married for 59 years. (Amber Ferguson/The Washington Post) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ron and Mary Tarnowski spent their days confined almost entirely to their home in Duluth, Minn. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Decades ago, at age 42, Mary Tarnowski suffered from a stroke that left her paralyzed on the right side of her body, making it difficult for her to move or speak. Her husband, Ron, served as her caretaker for more than 35 years, assisting her with daily tasks and rarely leaving her side. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But in recent years, Ron Tarnowski, an Air Force veteran and retired captain for the local fire department, began showing signs of early-stage dementia, his son and police told The Washington Post. Suddenly, the tough man with a \u201ccommanding presence,\u201d adventurous spirit and the build of a former football player needed to be taken care of, too. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Getting around became even more difficult for the Tarnowskis \u2014 Mary, 78, and Ron, 81. The couple hardly ever left the home, which their son, Karl Tarnowski, built adjacent to his own so he could keep an eye on them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Occasionally, Mary Tarnowski would ask her husband to go for a drive, perhaps to nearby restaurants. But they never stayed away for very long and would always be back well before nightfall. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cWhen the sun sets they\u2019ve always been home,\u201d Karl Tarnowski, the younger of the couple\u2019s two sons, said in an interview with The Washington Post. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So it was troubling when, on the evening of July 29, Karl Tarnowski and his wife found the elderly couple\u2019s home empty and their Chevy Tahoe gone. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mary and Ron Tarnowski had driven away that day without telling anyone. They left behind a cellphone, Mary\u2019s wheelchair and purse, and their medications. At 10 p.m., their worried children called the police to report them missing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For the next seven days, the family, law enforcement and hundreds of community members in Duluth launched an extensive search effort that covered thousands of miles. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Relatives and local authorities posted fliers all over the surrounding area and posted updates on a Facebook group called \u201cFind Ron and Mary Tarnowski,\u201d which was followed by more than 7,000 people across Minnesota and the United States. Retired Duluth firefighters joined the search for one of their own. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Duluth residents tied purple ribbons around trees and on businesses, in honor of the Alzheimer\u2019s Association. They held news conferences outside the Tarnowskis\u2019 home attended by the Duluth police chief and about 100 community members. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Relatives and police officials weighed several possible theories of where the couple could have gone. Perhaps they had headed northwest to Grand Rapids, Minn., where their sons had been spending the day. Maybe they were stopping by their family\u2019s hunting shack, about 30 miles away from their Duluth home. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Saturday afternoon, eight days after the couple went missing, the family received their answer, and a tragic end to their strenuous search. A U.S. Border Patrol helicopter found the couple\u2019s Chevy Tahoe on an overgrown, abandoned driveway in a swampy area off the road just two miles away from the family\u2019s hunting property. They were near Brookston, a town about 30 miles from their Duluth home. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mary\u2019s Tarnowski\u2019s body was discovered inside the Tahoe, and her husband\u2019s body was found outside the vehicle, about 50 feet from the road. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Authorities suspect Ron Tarnowski may have driven onto the trail accidentally before getting his car stuck in the mud, said Lt. Mike Ceynowa, public information officer for the Duluth Police Department. He said police think Tarnowski left the vehicle to seek help. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Autopsy results are pending, but Karl Tarnowski said there are signs that his mother died of a combination of dehydration and heat while sitting in the car on a day with temperatures in the upper 80s. There is also evidence that Ron Tarnowski had fallen down while trudging through the mud, his son said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Both are believed to have died July 29, the day they went missing, the son said. No foul play is suspected, according to authorities. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cIt\u2019s a horrific case,\u201d Ceynowa said. \u201cNobody wants to lose their parents this way.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But in the parents\u2019 final moments, Ceynowa said, Ron Tarnowski \u201cwas doing what he\u2019s done for years: trying to help his wife and take care of her.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Karl Tarnowski does not know what prompted his parents to drive so far away, but he suspects his father\u2019s dementia played a role. His father rarely visited the hunting cabin in recent years, and he never traveled there without one of his two sons. Even then, he would be on edge, wanting to hurry home before sundown to take care of his wife. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The morning before they went missing, \u201ceverything seemed totally normal,\u201d Karl Tarnowski said. His wife gave his mother a bath and cooked the couple some breakfast. Later that morning, he left town for the day, telling his father, \u201cSee you later, Papa.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cHe said, \u2018Take your time, but hurry back,'\u201d Tarnowski said. \u201cHe said, \u201cWe\u2019ll be here anyway. We never go anywhere.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Evidence uncovered during the course of the seven-day search revealed some details about the rest of their day. The couple stopped by a local Wells Fargo Bank, where Ron Tarnowski withdrew an amount of cash typical for him. Then they stopped at a restaurant for lunch, Karl Tarnowski said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The map shows the distance from Ron and Mary Tarnowski\u2019s home to where their bodies were found. (Google Maps) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At some point afterward, they headed northwest on Highway 2 toward their hunting property. It was a \u201cbeautiful\u201d summer day, Ceynowa said, \u201ca day we all hope for in the north.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A video from security cameras showed the couple in one of their final moments, walking through a bar and grill in Brookston, Minn., possibly hours before their vehicle got stuck. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The surveillance footage captured the extent of the couple\u2019s immobility. They could be seen slowly walking into the restaurant. Ron Tarnowski led the way, trudging along with his cane and holding his wife\u2019s hand as she walked behind him, dragging a leg. It took 16 minutes for the couple to take a bathroom break, Karl Tarnowski said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They had been married for 59 years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lately, caring for his wife had became a taxing responsibility for Ron Tarnowski. And in recent years, his mental deterioration became a challenge for his wife, their son said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But throughout these tribulations, Karl Tarnowski said, \u201ctheir love was outstanding for one another.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ron Tarnowski joined the Air Force before graduating from high school and was stationed in the Philippines for a long time, his son said. He actively volunteered with the Knights of Columbus, a Catholic fraternal organization. As a father, he could be a \u201ckind of harsh person\u201d at times, but he had a \u201cheart of gold,\u201d Karl Tarnowski said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR His father often offered to work on welding projects for neighbors and friends, and would always say \u201cthis weld is guaranteed,\u201d Tarnowski recounted. \u201cIf it breaks, I\u2019ll weld it again.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mary Tarnowski was a \u201cbig-hearted\u201d mother who \u201cloved people\u201d and always looked forward to playing cards with friends. Before her stroke, she volunteered with the census every 10 years, participated in her children\u2019s parent-teacher associations and made sure everything in the home was organized. She never had a driver\u2019s license, so her husband would frequently drive her around town. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThey went everywhere together,\u201d said Mark Lavalier, a retired firefighter who worked with Ron Tarnowski for several years and who assisted with the search efforts. \u201cYou\u2019d never see one without the other.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The story of the missing couple resonated with families across the state, particularly those with elderly parents, Lavalier said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cEverybody\u2019s got parents. Everybody watches them get old and realizes they become vulnerable,\u201d Lavalier said. \u201cThat\u2019s what people reacted to. This could be my parents. This could be everybody\u2019s parents.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The story of the Tarnowskis also underscored the dangers vulnerable adults can face when they leave home with no way of being reached or tracked. The OnStar device on the Chevy Tahoe was not activated, and neither Tarnowski was accustomed to carrying and using a cellphone. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Karl Tarnowski urged the importance of making sure vulnerable adults carry GPS tracking devices or cellphones at all times. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cIf there\u2019s any positive outcome to this,\u201d he said, it\u2019s that, perhaps, \u201cit\u2019s going to help somebody else find their parents someday.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR More from Morning Mix NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Boy Scouts\u2019 sailing lesson turns deadly when mast strikes power lines on Texas lake NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ted Bradford was exonerated for a 1996 rape.

The investigation into the deaths was ongoing Saturday night, but foul play wasn\u2019t suspected. It appeared the couple\u2019s SUV had gotten stuck, police said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They were found about a mile from the family\u2019s hunting camp, according to a statement posted on the \u201cFind Ron and Mary Tarnowski\u201d Facebook page that family members had started to aid the search. The camp is near U.S. Highway 2 between Brookston and Floodwood, and a few miles from where the couple had been last seen, the Country Corner store. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThe family would like to thank the many men and women of law enforcement, the active and retired firefighters, the Alzheimer\u2019s Association, and the overwhelming support of the community and the media for the diligent efforts this past week,\u201d the Facebook statement read. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Aircraft involved in the search had been grounded Friday because of thunderstorms in the region, officials said, but returned to the air on Saturday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The news prompted an outpouring of condolences and support on social media for the Tarnowski family \u2014 including the couple\u2019s sons, Kurt and Karl, and Karl\u2019s wife Bev \u2014 who had been tireless in recent days in organizing search efforts and checking on possible sightings. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ron, 82, and Mary, 78, had been last seen July 29 at the Country Corner store along Highway 2. Ron was in the early stages of dementia, and Mary suffered from right-side paralysis and had difficulty speaking. They lived in a home Karl Tarnowski built for his parents, adjacent to his own home in Duluth. They generally spent most of their time at home, going out only for an occasional meal at nearby restaurants. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They weren\u2019t carrying cellphones or credit cards when they went missing, and an OnStar system in their vehicle was not activated, which left authorities with few clues to pinpoint a search over the past week. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cWe're not looking for a needle in a haystack, because we haven't found the haystack yet,\u201d Duluth Police Chief Mike Tusken said at a Saturday morning gathering at the Tarnowskis\u2019 home. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR More than 100 volunteers, some wearing purple T-shirts and ribbons for Alzheimer\u2019s awareness, gathered in Ron and Mary\u2019s driveway to begin another day of searching for the couple Saturday. A photo of Ron and Mary was taped to their garage with a sign above it: \u201cMissing 8 days.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR About 20 current and retired Duluth firefighters were among the crowd of volunteers to search for one of their own. Ron was a Duluth firefighter for 31 years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Retired Duluth firefighters Jim Reed and Mark Lavalier had already been out searching in the past week. Lavalier worked with Ron and lives one block south of the Tarnowskis. Trying to hold back tears on Saturday morning, before the couple was found, he said, \u201cIf it was me, I know that they\u2019d be there for me.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Reed didn\u2019t know Ron well, but said \u201cnobody deserves this, to be lost\u201d and to be confused with dementia. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Law enforcement\u2019s efforts to find the Tarnowskis ramped up on Saturday with a new emergency command center set up in Pike Lake and a new tip line with two dispatchers dedicated to the case. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR During the Saturday morning gathering, Tusken said the police department\u2019s violent crimes unit, which handles missing person cases, had been working on the case since Day One and had tracked down dozens of leads in six counties and two states. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The police department decided to change tactics on Friday night due to the expanding search for the couple, and the command center created a centralized location for the various agencies assisting in the search. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At the command center on Saturday, before the Tarnowskis were found, there was a steady stream of phone calls with tips and search updates. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Law enforcement officials studied a gas station\u2019s surveillance video, cross-referencing it with Google Maps and a tip to determine the likelihood that Ron and Mary\u2019s vehicle might have been captured on the video. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On the wall, areas already searched were being marked on a large map of Northeastern Minnesota. Authorities had notified FedEx, UPS and rural mail carriers to keep an eye out, and some student pilots had flown over the region to search while getting in their practice hours. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Reed, the retired Duluth firefighter who had gathered with dozens of other volunteers Saturday morning at the Tarnowskis\u2019 home, said at that time that the community response \u201cis a big circle. Hopefully somebody will do it for us or one of our loved ones if it happened to them. That\u2019s how we do it. We live in a society where we all got to help each other out.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Andrew Krueger of the News Tribune staff contributed to this report.\n",

By the afternoon, a helicopter had found both the haystack and the needle, to tragic ends. Ron and Mary Tarnowski were found dead in the Brookston area, near a hunting shack the family owned about 30 miles from Duluth. Foul play isn't suspected. The Washington Post reports the couple lived near one of their sons, Karl Tarnowski, who noticed they uncharacteristically didn't return home on July 29. The Duluth News Tribune reports the couple didn't have cellphones or credit cards on them, nor did their car's OnStar system engage, leaving authorities with little to go on. But there was, perhaps, a general area: Their last sighting had been at 1pm on the day they went missing at a corner store near Brookston. KARE reports the Tarnowskis' Chevy Tahoe was found in a remote area, apparently stuck on what seemed to be a \"swampy\" trail typically accessed by snowmobilers in the winter. Mary, 78, was in the vehicle; Ron, 82, was outside it, some 50 feet from the road, suggesting he had gone in search of help. Karl tells the Post that it's thought both died the day they went missing; Mary is believed to have succumbed to dehydration and heat. The couple is depicted as a devoted one: A stroke at age 42 left Mary paralyzed on her right side; Ron was constantly by her side, but had himself begun to show early signs of dementia.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We were told that we had passed all the interviews and had been selected to adopt a baby,\" said Riaz Uddin, 40, an engineer. \"We got our baby on live TV.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The abandoned babies were rescued by the Chhipa Welfare Association, a Pakistani aid organization. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"In a day or two, the next baby will be given away, God willing,\" its head, Ramzan Chhipa, told Reuters on Thursday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While the Chhipa teams scour the garbage dumps and other sites for discarded newborns, Hussain is also appealing for babies directly. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"If any family cannot afford to bring up their new born baby due to poverty or illness then instead of killing them, they should hand over the baby to Dr Aamir,\" a notice on his website reads. The children would be given to deserving couples on air, the notice said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The show's producers did not return Reuters calls seeking comment. It was not clear if poor families wishing to keep their children would also be helped. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR FIGHTING FOR VIEWERS NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Many Pakistanis expressed disgust that abandoned babies were being given away in what they see as an attempt to boost ratings. Chhipa insisted thousands of people wanted a baby and all potential parents were properly vetted. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The true outrage, he said, was the poverty forcing families to abandon children. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hussain's show is one of many such broadcasts. The Pakistani media has flourished over the past decade or so following the liberalization of the industry, particularly broadcasting, after decades of tight state control. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now, instead of battling state restrictions, presenters fight for audiences and advertising by seeing who is most outrageous. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Recent episodes include a female anchor stalking couples in a park to challenge their morality, and a news program which once ran a live broadcast showing a staff member bleeding to death in an operating theatre after he was shot in a riot. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Even among this company, Hussain stands out. In 2008, he hosted scholars who called for the deaths of Ahmadis, a persecuted religious sect in Pakistan. Within a day, two prominent Ahmadis had been shot dead. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The year before, he had to resign from his post as junior minister for religious affairs after denouncing author Salman Rushdie for blasphemy, a crime punished by death in Pakistan. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Since then, his university degree has been exposed as a fake and a video showing him making crude jokes with clerics between takes of his show has leaked onto YouTube. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"There is nothing they won't do to get viewers,\" said comedian Sami Shah. \"If I was a cynic, I'd say this can only end badly.

As in, actual human babies. Host Aamir Liaquat Hussain gave away two infant girls last month and plans to keep going, reports Reuters. Witness the posting on his website: \"If any family cannot afford to bring up their new born baby due to poverty or illness then instead of killing them, they should hand over the baby to Dr Aamir.\" The first two babies were provided by a Pakistani aid organization that takes in abandoned infants, and both the show and the organization insist that the recipients were vetted. \"If we didn't find this baby, a cat or a dog would have eaten it,\" Hussain told his cheering audience before handing over one of the baby girls to a childless couple. Reuters explains that Pakistan has loosened its control over broadcasting in recent years, leading to a slew of such ratings-grabbing stunts. CNN describes this particular show, Aman Ramazan, as a Pakistani version of The Price is Right. Audience members typically win prizes for correctly answering questions about the Koran. Only now, the show is giving away babies along with fridges and microwaves.\n"

Marcus Merritt, testified Wednesday that Holcomb addressed him with a racial slur and threatened to \"kill me and put me in a body bag and send me home.\u2019\u2019 Merritt said he became suicidal after enduring punishment and humiliation from Holcomb. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In their opening statements, prosecutors had said testimony would show that soldiers taunted Chen with racial slurs, kicked him and pelted him with rocks in merciless hazing in the weeks before the private\u2019s suicide. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Holcomb, 30, is the first to face court-martial in a case that has focused renewed attention on allegations of hazing and racism in the Army, where Asian Americans are a distinct minority. Courts-martial for the other seven soldiers, including an officer, are scheduled for later this year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Military prosecutors elicited the testimony in the second day of the proceedings to buttress charges that Holcomb hazed and hounded Chen, a Chinese American, into committing suicide at a remote combat outpost in Afghanistan on Oct. 3. Holcomb, one of eight soldiers charged in connection with Chen\u2019s death, faces charges of negligent homicide, assault, reckless endangerment and other counts. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR FT. BRAGG, N.C. -- Sgt. Adam Holcomb bombarded Danny Chen, a shy, 19-year-old Army private, with racial slurs and bloodied Chen\u2019s back by dragging him across rocky ground for disobeying a platoon rule, several former members of Holcomb\u2019s platoon testified at his court-martial Wednesday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR U.S. Army Sgt. Adam Holcomb, right, is the first of eight men facing prosecution\u2026 (Raul R. Rubiera, The Fayetteville\u2026) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"He was in my face constantly,\u2019\u2019 Merritt testified when asked why he had contemplated suicide. \"All the stuff he did had a long-lasting effect on me.\u2019\u2019 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Under cross-examination, Merritt conceded that he knew Holcomb wasn\u2019t serious about killing him. But he also said he feared the sergeant, telling a military psychiatrist he wanted to kill Holcomb. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Holcomb\u2019s immediate superior, Staff Sgt. Darren Holt, told the military panel of 10 officers and non-commissioned officers that he confronted Holcomb after the sergeant dragged Chen across sharp, baseball-sized rocks in late September. Holcomb was angry that Chen had ignored posted rules to turn off power to a water heater after taking a shower. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Holt said he told Holcomb that physically abusing a soldier was wrong and reported the incident to superiors. \"I verbally counseled him [Holcomb] . . . and made it clear that was unacceptable,\u2019\u2019 Holt said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Chen shot himself under the chin in a base guard tower a week after the dragging incident, according to the Army. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Chen\u2019s death outraged some Chinese American activists in New York City\u2019s Chinatown, where Chen grew up with his immigrant parents. Several activists are attending the court-martial, along with journalists from China. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Holcomb\u2019s military lawyers have said Chen killed himself because his parents had disowned him for joining the Army instead of attending college. They have portrayed Chen as an incompetent soldier who endangered his platoon and required constant discipline for such violations as sleeping on guard duty or reporting for his guard post without his helmet. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Defense lawyers have also said that nicknames -- even those with racially tinged overtones -- were common \"terms of endearment\u2019\u2019 in the small, tight-knit platoon. One African American platoon member, they said, encouraged soldiers to call him \"Black Mamba.\u2019\u2019 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Under cross-examination by the defense, former members of the platoon conceded that most discipline meted out by Holcomb was justified by Chen\u2019s failure to follow orders or regulations. Such \"corrective training,\u2019\u2019 especially in combat zones, is an accepted way to improve soldiers\u2019 performance, according to testimony. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Several soldiers testified that Chen never gave any overt indication that he was contemplating suicide. The platoon medic, Spec. Zachary Bolin, who treated Chen\u2019s back abrasions at Holcomb\u2019s request, said Chen denied suicidal thoughts when Bolin asked him about it. ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

I am sorry for that, and I am focused on making it right.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Thank you, NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kevin Systrom co-founder, Instagram ||||| Eric Piermont/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 In the aftermath of the uproar over changes to Instagram\u2019s privacy policy and terms of service earlier this week, the company did an about-face late Thursday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a blog post on the company\u2019s site, Kevin Systrom, Instagram\u2019s co-founder, said that where advertising was concerned, the company would revert to its previous terms of service, which have been in effect since October 2010. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cRather than obtain permission from you to introduce possible advertising products we have not yet developed,\u201d he wrote, \u201cwe are going to take the time to complete our plans, and then come back to our users and explain how we would like for our advertising business to work.\u201d Users had been particularly concerned by a clause in Instagram\u2019s policy introduced on Monday that suggested Instagram would share users\u2019 data \u2014 like their favorite places, bands, restaurants and hobbies \u2014 with Facebook and its advertisers to better target ads. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They also took issue with an update to the company\u2019s terms of service that suggested users\u2019 photos could be used in advertisements, without compensation and even without their knowledge. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The terms of that user agreement said, \u201cYou agree that a business or other entity may pay us to display your user name, likeness, photos (along with any associated metadata) and/or actions you take, in connection with paid or sponsored content or promotions, without any compensation to you.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Following a reaction that included customers defecting to other services, Mr. Systrom told Instagram users on Tuesday that the new policy had been misinterpreted. \u201cIt is our mistake that this language is confusing,\u201d he wrote, and he promised an updated agreement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That statement apparently was not enough. With more people leaving the service, the company, which Facebook bought for $735 million this year, reacted again by returning to the old rules. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Acknowledging those concerns late Thursday, Mr. Systrom wrote: \u201cI want to be really clear: Instagram has no intention of selling your photos, and we never did. We don\u2019t own your photos \u2014 you do.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Systrom said the company would still be tweaking its privacy policy to quell users\u2019 fears that their photos might pop-up on third-party sites without their consent. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Mr. Systrom did not clarify how Instagram planned to monetize its service in the future. Facebook is under pressure to make Instagram earn income. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cIt\u2019s a free service \u2014 they have to monetize somewhere,\u201d said John Casasanta, a principal at Tap Tap Tap, the maker of Camera+, a photo-filter app that has shunned advertising and instead charges users for premium features. \u201cThe days of the simple banner ads are gone. Their user data is too valuable.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It was unclear whether reverting its terms of service would be enough to satisfy high-profile users like National Geographic, which stopped using its Instagram account in light of the moves, or other users who have aired their grievances on Twitter and Facebook. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The controversy has driven traffic and new users to several other photo-sharing applications. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Pheed, an Instagram-like app that gives users the option to monetize their own content by charging followers to see their posts, gained more users than any other app in the United States on Thursday. By Thursday morning, Pheed had jumped to the ninth most downloaded social-networking app in Apple\u2019s iTunes store, just ahead of LinkedIn. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR O. D. Kobo, Pheed\u2019s chief executive, said Thursday morning that subscriptions to the service had quadrupled this week and that in the last 24 hours users had uploaded 300,000 new files to the service \u2014 more uploads than any other 24-hour-period since Pheed made its debut six weeks ago. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Another runaway success was Flickr, Yahoo\u2019s photo-sharing service, which redesigned its app last week to make it easier to share photos on Twitter. In a stroke of good fortune, it released the app to positive reviews just as Instagram announced it would no longer sync with Twitter, a Facebook rival. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The day before Instagram announced changes to its terms of service, Flickr\u2019s mobile app was ranked at around 175 in Apple\u2019s overall iTunes app charts. Since that day, the application skyrocketed to the high 20s. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Of course, most of these services are still tiny compared to Instagram, which claims to have more than 100 million members who have uploaded upward of 5 billion photos using its service. And it was unclear if the services\u2019 newfound members had also deleted their Instagram accounts or were merely dabbling in other offerings. But the migration, whether temporary or permanent, was a reminder of the volatility of success and that the fall to bottom can sometimes be as swift as the rise to the top. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Facebook and Instagram declined to say whether they had seen any significant number of account deletions or if they were concerned about losing ground in the photo-sharing market to rivals. Some photo apps took direct aim at Instagram. Camera+ even went so far as to include a snide, holiday-themed reference to Instagram\u2019s stumbles in an app update on Wednesday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cWe\u2019ll never do shady things with your shared pics, because it just isn\u2019t right,\u201d the update noted. \u201cOn that note, happy Christmas to all, and to all a good night!\u201d\n",

Others say the bill is an overreach and questioned how police could enforce it.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When the skaters were asked minutes after Friday\u2019s performance if they hoped to compete at the Games, their coach, Kim Hyon-son, stepped in and said, \u201cIt is up to the North Korean Olympic Committee to decide whether they will participate or not.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The North Koreans appeared relaxed and open \u2014 to a point \u2014 at a second meeting with reporters after the competition here, the Nebelhorn Trophy, but requested that no questions be asked about the Olympics. Their reluctance probably stemmed from the fact that the decision will not be theirs, said Bruno Marcotte, a prominent French Canadian coach who also works with the skaters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cIt\u2019s out of their hands,\u201d he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Clearly, though, the outcome was important to North Korea. It has invested considerable time and money to make Ms. Ryom and Mr. Kim eligible for the Winter Games and respected at the international level. The skaters trained over the summer in Montreal with Mr. Marcotte, whose wife, Meagan Duhamel, is a two-time world pairs champion. And the pressure of a suitable performance here seemed to weigh on Ri Chol-un, an official with the North Korean skating federation.\n",
        "summary": "\u2013 Amid rising nuclear tensions, two figure skaters Friday became the first North Korean athletes to qualify for the 2018 Winter Olympics, which will be held just 40 miles south of the demilitarized zone in South Korea, CNN reports. According to the New York Times, 18-year-old Ryom Tae-Ok and 25-year-old Kim Ju-Sik, who have been training in Canada with a French coach, finished with a score of 180.09 at the Nebelhorn Trophy in Germany. It was a career-best performance in an international competition for the pair. Kim says they were motivated by their coaches and the people cheering for them. Ryom agreed: \"There were many people of different nationalities and backgrounds cheering for us. The fact that we gave them some kind of joy, that was the best part in the performance.\" While Kim and Ryom's sixth place finish in Germany was enough to nab them one of the final spots in February's Olympics, it remains unclear if they'll actually compete, Reuters reports. The decision rests with the North Korea Olympic Committee. Both South Korea and the International Olympic Committee have been pushing for North Korean athletes to participate in the Games, hoping it will be a diplomatic balm for the countries. The IOC has been providing travel, equipment, and accommodation to North Korean athletes attempting to qualify (North Korean skiers and speed skaters still have a shot), and South Korea's president said North Korea will have as much time as possible to decide if it will participate. North Korea boycotted the 1988 Summer Olympics in South Korea, but it did send a women's hockey team and taekwondo team to competitions in South Korea this year.\n"

        "document": "Marketers and manufacturers that promote their products as Made in USA must meet the \u201call or virtually all\u201d standard. This publication offers practical guidance on Made in USA claims. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Introduction NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is charged with preventing deception and unfairness in the marketplace. The FTC Act gives the Commission the power to bring law enforcement actions against false or misleading claims that a product is of U.S. origin. Traditionally, the Commission has required that a product advertised as Made in USA be \"all or virtually all\" made in the U.S. After a comprehensive review of Made in USA and other U.S. origin claims in product advertising and labeling, the Commission announced in December 1997 that it would retain the \"all or virtually all\" standard. The Commission also issued an Enforcement Policy Statement on U.S. Origin Claims to provide guidance to marketers who want to make an unqualified Made in USA claim under the \"all or virtually all\" standard and those who want to make a qualified Made in USA claim. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This publication provides additional guidance about how to comply with the \"all or virtually all\" standard. It also offers some general information about the U.S. Customs Service\u2019s requirement that all products of foreign origin imported into the U.S. be marked with the name of the country of origin. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This publication is the Federal Trade Commission staff\u2019s view of the law\u2019s requirements. It is not binding on the Commission. The Enforcement Policy Statement issued by the FTC is at the end of the publication. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Basic Information About Made In USA Claims NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Must U.S. content be disclosed on products sold in the U.S.? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR U.S. content must be disclosed on automobiles and textile, wool, and fur products. There\u2019s no law that requires most other products sold in the U.S. to be marked or labeled Made in USA or have any other disclosure about their amount of U.S. content. However, manufacturers and marketers who choose to make claims about the amount of U.S. content in their products must comply with the FTC\u2019s Made in USA policy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What products does the FTC\u2019s Made in USA policy apply to? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The policy applies to all products advertised or sold in the U.S., except for those specifically subject to country-of-origin labeling by other laws. Other countries may have their own country-of-origin marking requirements. As a result, exporters should determine whether the country to which they are exporting imposes such requirements. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What kinds of claims does the Enforcement Policy Statement apply to? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Enforcement Policy Statement applies to U.S. origin claims that appear on products and labeling, advertising, and other promotional materials. It also applies to all other forms of marketing, including marketing through digital or electronic mechanisms, such as Internet or e-mail. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A Made in USA claim can be express or implied. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Examples of express claims: Made in USA. \"Our products are American-made.\" \"USA.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In identifying implied claims, the Commission focuses on the overall impression of the advertising, label, or promotional material. Depending on the context, U.S. symbols or geographic references (for example, U.S. flags, outlines of U.S. maps, or references to U.S. locations of headquarters or factories) may convey a claim of U.S. origin either by themselves, or in conjunction with other phrases or images. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Example: A company promotes its product in an ad that features a manager describing the \"true American quality\" of the work produced at the company\u2019s American factory. Although there is no express representation that the company\u2019s product is made in the U.S., the overall \u2014 or net \u2014 impression the ad is likely to convey to consumers is that the product is of U.S. origin. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Brand names and trademarks NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ordinarily, the Commission will not consider a manufacturer or marketer\u2019s use of an American brand name or trademark by itself as a U.S. origin claim. Similarly, the Commission is not likely to interpret the mere listing of a company\u2019s U.S. address on a package label in a non-prominent way as a claim of U.S. origin. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Example: A product is manufactured abroad by a well-known U.S. company. The fact that the company is headquartered in the U.S. also is widely known. Company pamphlets for its foreign-made product prominently feature its brand name. Assuming that the brand name does not specifically denote U.S. origin (that is, the brand name is not \"Made in America, Inc.\"), using the brand name by itself does not constitute a claim of U.S. origin. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Representations about entire product lines NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Manufacturers and marketers should not indicate, either expressly or implicitly, that a whole product line is of U.S. origin (\"Our products are made in USA\") when only some products in the product line are made in the U.S. according to the \"all or virtually all\" standard. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Does the FTC pre-approve Made in USA claims? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Commission does not pre-approve advertising or labeling claims. A company doesn\u2019t need approval from the Commission before making a Made in USA claim. As with most other advertising claims, a manufacturer or marketer may make any claim as long as it is truthful and substantiated. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Standard For Unqualified Made In USA Claims NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What is the standard for a product to be called Made in USA without qualification? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For a product to be called Made in USA, or claimed to be of domestic origin without qualifications or limits on the claim, the product must be \"all or virtually all\" made in the U.S. The term \"United States,\" as referred to in the Enforcement Policy Statement, includes the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories and possessions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What does \"all or virtually all\" mean? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"All or virtually all\" means that all significant parts and processing that go into the product must be of U.S. origin. That is, the product should contain no \u2014 or negligible \u2014 foreign content. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What substantiation is required for a Made in USA claim? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When a manufacturer or marketer makes an unqualified claim that a product is Made in USA, it should have \u2014 and rely on \u2014 a \"reasonable basis\" to support the claim at the time it is made. This means a manufacturer or marketer needs competent and reliable evidence to back up the claim that its product is \"all or virtually all\" made in the U.S. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What factors does the Commission consider to determine whether a product is \"all or virtually all\" made in the U.S.? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The product\u2019s final assembly or processing must take place in the U.S. The Commission then considers other factors, including how much of the product\u2019s total manufacturing costs can be assigned to U.S. parts and processing, and how far removed any foreign content is from the finished product. In some instances, only a small portion of the total manufacturing costs are attributable to foreign processing, but that processing represents a significant amount of the product\u2019s overall processing. The same could be true for some foreign parts. In these cases, the foreign content (processing or parts) is more than negligible, and, as a result, unqualified claims are inappropriate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Example: A company produces propane barbecue grills at a plant in Nevada. The product\u2019s major components include the gas valve, burner and aluminum housing, each of which is made in the U.S. The grill\u2019s knobs and tubing are imported from Mexico. An unqualified Made in USA claim is not likely to be deceptive because the knobs and tubing make up a negligible portion of the product\u2019s total manufacturing costs and are insignificant parts of the final product. Example: A table lamp is assembled in the U.S. from American-made brass, an American-made Tiffany-style lampshade, and an imported base. The base accounts for a small percent of the total cost of making the lamp. An unqualified Made in USA claim is deceptive for two reasons: The base is not far enough removed in the manufacturing process from the finished product to be of little consequence and it is a significant part of the final product. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What items should manufacturers and marketers include in analyzing the percentage of domestic content in a particular product? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Manufacturers and marketers should use the cost of goods sold or inventory costs of finished goods in their analysis. Such costs generally are limited to the total cost of all manufacturing materials, direct manufacturing labor, and manufacturing overhead. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Should manufacturers and marketers rely on information from American suppliers about the amount of domestic content in the parts, components, and other elements they buy and use for their final products? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If given in good faith, manufacturers and marketers can rely on information from suppliers about the domestic content in the parts, components, and other elements they produce. Rather than assume that the input is 100 percent U.S.-made, however, manufacturers and marketers would be wise to ask the supplier for specific information about the percentage of U.S. content before they make a U.S. origin claim. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Example: A company manufactures food processors in its U.S. plant, making most of the parts, including the housing and blade, from U.S. materials. The motor, which constitutes 50 percent of the food processor\u2019s total manufacturing costs, is bought from a U.S. supplier. The food processor manufacturer knows that the motor is assembled in a U.S. factory. Even though most of the parts of the food processor are of U.S. origin, the final assembly is in the U.S., and the motor is assembled in the U.S., the food processor is not considered \"all or virtually all\" American-made if the motor itself is made of imported parts that constitute a significant percentage of the appliance\u2019s total manufacturing cost. Before claiming the product is Made in USA, this manufacturer should look to its motor supplier for more specific information about the motor\u2019s origin. Example: On its purchase order, a company states: \"Our company requires that suppliers certify the percentage of U.S. content in products supplied to us. If you are unable or unwilling to make such certification, we will not purchase from you.\" Appearing under this statement is the sentence, \"We certify that our ___ have at least ___% U.S. content,\" with space for the supplier to fill in the name of the product and its percentage of U.S. content. The company generally could rely on a certification like this to determine the appropriate country-of-origin designation for its product. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR How far back in the manufacturing process should manufacturers and marketers look? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To determine the percentage of U.S. content, manufacturers and marketers should look back far enough in the manufacturing process to be reasonably sure that any significant foreign content has been included in their assessment of foreign costs. Foreign content incorporated early in the manufacturing process often will be less significant to consumers than content that is a direct part of the finished product or the parts or components produced by the immediate supplier. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Example: The steel used to make a single component of a complex product (for example, the steel used in the case of a computer\u2019s floppy drive) is an early input into the computer\u2019s manufacture, and is likely to constitute a very small portion of the final product\u2019s total cost. On the other hand, the steel in a product like a pipe or a wrench is a direct and significant input. Whether the steel in a pipe or wrench is imported would be a significant factor in evaluating whether the finished product is \"all or virtually all\" made in the U.S. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Are raw materials included in the evaluation of whether a product is \"all or virtually all\" made in the U.S.? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It depends on how much of the product\u2019s cost the raw materials make up and how far removed from the finished product they are. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Example: If the gold in a gold ring is imported, an unqualified Made in USA claim for the ring is deceptive. That\u2019s because of the significant value the gold is likely to represent relative to the finished product, and because the gold \u2014 an integral component \u2014 is only one step back from the finished article. By contrast, consider the plastic in the plastic case of a clock radio otherwise made in the U.S. of U.S.-made components. If the plastic case was made from imported petroleum, a Made in USA claim is likely to be appropriate because the petroleum is far enough removed from the finished product, and is an insignificant part of it as well. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Qualified Claims NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What is a qualified Made in USA claim? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A qualified Made in USA claim describes the extent, amount or type of a product\u2019s domestic content or processing; it indicates that the product isn\u2019t entirely of domestic origin. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Example: \"60% U.S. content.\" \"Made in USA of U.S. and imported parts.\" \"Couch assembled in USA from Italian Leather and Mexican Frame.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When is a qualified Made in USA claim appropriate? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A qualified Made in USA claim is appropriate for products that include U.S. content or processing but don\u2019t meet the criteria for making an unqualified Made in USA claim. Because even qualified claims may imply more domestic content than exists, manufacturers or marketers must exercise care when making these claims. That is, avoid qualified claims unless the product has a significant amount of U.S. content or U.S. processing. A qualified Made in USA claim, like an unqualified claim, must be truthful and substantiated. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Example: An exercise treadmill is assembled in the U.S. The assembly represents significant work and constitutes a \"substantial transformation\" (a term used by the U.S. Customs Service). All of the treadmill\u2019s major parts, including the motor, frame, and electronic display, are imported. A few of its incidental parts, such as the handle bar covers, the plastic on/off power key, and the treadmill mat, are manufactured in the U.S. Together, these parts account for approximately three percent of the total cost of all the parts. Because the value of the U.S.-made parts is negligible compared to the value of all the parts, a claim on the treadmill that it is \"Made in USA of U.S. and Imported Parts\" is deceptive. A claim like \"Made in U.S. from Imported Parts\" or \"Assembled in U.S.A.\" would not be deceptive. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR U.S. origin claims for specific processes or parts NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Claims that a particular manufacturing or other process was performed in the U.S. or that a particular part was manufactured in the U.S. must be truthful, substantiated, and clearly refer to the specific process or part, not to the general manufacture of the product, to avoid implying more U.S. content than exists. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Manufacturers and marketers should be cautious about using general terms, such as \"produced,\" \"created\" or \"manufactured\" in the U.S. Words like these are unlikely to convey a message limited to a particular process. Additional qualification probably is necessary to describe a product that is not \"all or virtually all\" made in the U.S. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In addition, if a product is of foreign origin (that is, it has been substantially transformed abroad), manufacturers and marketers also should make sure they satisfy Customs\u2019 markings statute and regulations that require such products to be marked with a foreign country of origin. Further, Customs requires the foreign country of origin to be preceded by \"Made in,\" \"Product of,\" or words of similar meaning when any city or location that is not the country of origin appears on the product. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Example: A company designs a product in New York City and sends the blueprint to a factory in Finland for manufacturing. It labels the product \"Designed in USA \u2014 Made in Finland.\" Such a specific processing claim would not lead a reasonable consumer to believe that the whole product was made in the U.S. The Customs Service requires the product to be marked \"Made in,\" or \"Product of\" Finland since the product is of Finnish origin and the claim refers to the U.S. Examples of other specific processing claims are: \"Bound in U.S. \u2014 Printed in Turkey.\" \"Hand carved in U.S. \u2014 Wood from Philippines.\" \"Software written in U.S. \u2014 Disk made in India.\" \"Painted and fired in USA. Blanks made in (foreign country of origin).\" Example: A company advertises its product, which was invented in Seattle and manufactured in Bangladesh, as \"Created in USA.\" This claim is deceptive because consumers are likely to interpret the term \"Created\" as Made in USA \u2014 an unqualified U.S. origin claim. Example: A computer imported from Korea is packaged in the U.S. in an American-made corrugated paperboard box containing only domestic materials and domestically produced expanded rigid polystyrene plastic packing. Stating Made in USA on the package would deceive consumers about the origin of the product inside. But the company could legitimately make a qualified claim, such as \"Computer Made in Korea \u2014 Packaging Made in USA.\" Example: The Acme Camera Company assembles its cameras in the U.S. The camera lenses are manufactured in the U.S., but most of the remaining parts are imported. A magazine ad for the camera is headlined \"Beware of Imported Imitations\" and states \"Other high-end camera makers use imported parts made with cheap foreign labor. But at Acme Camera, we want only the highest quality parts for our cameras and we believe in employing American workers. That\u2019s why we make all of our lenses right here in the U.S.\" This ad is likely to convey that more than a specific product part (the lens) is of U.S. origin. The marketer should be prepared to substantiate the broader U.S. origin claim conveyed to consumers viewing the ad. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Comparative Claims NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Comparative claims should be truthful and substantiated, and presented in a way that makes the basis for comparison clear (for example, whether the comparison is to another leading brand or to a previous version of the same product). They should truthfully describe the U.S. content of the product and be based on a meaningful difference in U.S. content between the compared products. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Example: An ad for cellular phones states \"We use more U.S. content than any other cellular phone manufacturer.\" The manufacturer assembles the phones in the U.S. from American and imported components and can substantiate that the difference between the U.S. content of its phones and that of the other manufacturers\u2019 phones is significant. This comparative claim is not deceptive. Example: A product is advertised as having \"twice as much U.S. content as before.\" The U.S. content in the product has been increased from 2 percent in the previous version to 4 percent in the current version. This comparative claim is deceptive because the difference between the U.S. content in the current and previous version of the product are insignificant. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Assembled in USA Claims NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A product that includes foreign components may be called \"Assembled in USA\" without qualification when its principal assembly takes place in the U.S. and the assembly is substantial. For the \"assembly\" claim to be valid, the product\u2019s last \"substantial transformation\" also should have occurred in the U.S. That\u2019s why a \"screwdriver\" assembly in the U.S. of foreign components into a final product at the end of the manufacturing process doesn\u2019t usually qualify for the \"Assembled in USA\" claim. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Example: A lawn mower, composed of all domestic parts except for the cable sheathing, flywheel, wheel rims and air filter (15 to 20 percent foreign content) is assembled in the U.S. An \"Assembled in USA\" claim is appropriate. Example: All the major components of a computer, including the motherboard and hard drive, are imported. The computer\u2019s components then are put together in a simple \"screwdriver\" operation in the U.S., are not substantially transformed under the Customs Standard, and must be marked with a foreign country of origin. An \"Assembled in U.S.\" claim without further qualification is deceptive. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The FTC and The Customs Service NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What is the U.S. Customs Service\u2019s jurisdiction over country-of-origin claims? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Tariff Act gives Customs and the Secretary of the Treasury the power to administer the requirement that imported goods be marked with a foreign country of origin (for example, \"Made in Japan\"). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When an imported product incorporates materials and/or processing from more than one country, Customs considers the country of origin to be the last country in which a \"substantial transformation\" took place. Customs defines \"substantial transformation\" as a manufacturing process that results in a new and different product with a new name, character, and use that is different from that which existed before the change. Customs makes country-of-origin determinations using the \"substantial transformation\" test on a case-by-case basis. In some instances, Customs uses a \"tariff shift\" analysis, comparable to \"substantial transformation,\" to determine a product\u2019s country of origin. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What is the interaction between the FTC and Customs regarding country-of-origin claims? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Even if Customs determines that an imported product does not need a foreign country-of-origin mark, it is not necessarily permissible to promote that product as Made in USA. The FTC considers additional factors to decide whether a product can be advertised or labeled as Made in USA. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Manufacturers and marketers should check with Customs to see if they need to mark their products with the foreign country of origin. If they don\u2019t, they should look at the FTC\u2019s standard to check if they can properly make a Made in USA claim. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The FTC has jurisdiction over foreign origin claims on products and in packaging that are beyond the disclosures required by Customs (for example, claims that supplement a required foreign origin marking to indicate where additional processing or finishing of a product occurred). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The FTC also has jurisdiction over foreign origin claims in advertising and other promotional materials. Unqualified U.S. origin claims in ads or other promotional materials for products that Customs requires a foreign country-of-origin mark may mislead or confuse consumers about the product\u2019s origin. To avoid misleading consumers, marketers should clearly disclose the foreign manufacture of a product. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Example: A television set assembled in Korea using an American-made picture tube is shipped to the U.S. The Customs Service requires the television set to be marked \"Made in Korea\" because that\u2019s where the television set was last \"substantially transformed.\" The company\u2019s World Wide Web page states \"Although our televisions are made abroad, they always contain U.S.-made picture tubes.\" This statement is not deceptive. However, making the statement \"All our picture tubes are made in the USA\" \u2014 without disclosing the foreign origin of the television\u2019s manufacture \u2014 might imply a broader claim (for example, that the television set is largely made in the U.S.) than could be substantiated. That is, if the statement and the entire ad imply that any foreign content or processing is negligible, the advertiser must substantiate that claim or net impression.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The report found that both Walmart\u2019s store brand products, such as Equate makeup sponges and tooth whitening strips, as well as other brands, such as Almay eyeliner, were falsely labeled as made in the United States. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some products clearly displayed contrary information, such as a red, white, and blue \u201cmade in the USA\u201d logo on the front, with the words \u201cMade in China\u201d displayed on the back. Other products were stamped with the patriotic logo while the product specifications listed the item as imported. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Walmart had an excuse, but the labels are magically gone NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While there is no official certification process for labeling a product \u201cmade in the USA,\u201d a company can still be sued for false advertising if they misuse the label. However, rather than taking legal action, Truth in Advertising simply sent a letter to Walmart CEO, Doug McMillon, causing the retail chain some embarrassment, but sparing them the court room drama. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Walmart responded by saying that some manufacturing of its store brands had recently moved to the United States, but the website hadn\u2019t been update yet. However, many Made in USA labels were removed from the website after Truth in Advertising\u2019s letter went public. As for other brands, Walmart claims that the country of origin information comes from the supplier. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Great reminder to stay honest NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Unimpressed by these excuses, executive direction of Truth in Advertising, Bonnie Patten, says that the \u201clargest retailer in the world should have made sure its American-made claims were accurate before affixing made in USA labels on the products. Until Walmart cleans up this mess, consumers cannot rely on Walmart with regard to where a product is really made when shopping on the site.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The report also argues that the website\u2019s labels for \u201cMade in USA\u201d and \u201cAssembled in USA,\u201d with their tiny fonts and identical color schemes, are too similar to distinguish on the website, even though the Federal Trade Commission makes a clear differentiation between these two labels. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR All of this is an important reminder for businesses to stay honest in advertising. All it takes is a watchdog with an internet connection and keen eye to uncover false claims. ||||| While there is no official review process required for labeling a product as \u201cMade in the U.S.A.,\u201d a company can get into legal trouble for misusing that label, as doing so may constitute false advertising. A new report from an advertising watchdog group claims that Walmart\u2019s website has more than 100 examples of products incorrectly marketed as made in America. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to a letter [PDF] recently sent by the group Truth In Advertising to Walmart CEO Doug McMillon, \u201cWalmart\u2019s website is mired in USA labeling errors.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Among the items singled out in the letter are Walmart\u2019s Equate store-brand makeup sponges in the image at the top of this story. TINA says these were given the Made in the U.S.A. label on Walmart.com even though the product\u2019s own packaging clearly states that they were \u201cMade in China.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Another Equate-brand product called out by TINA are these teeth-whitening strips that the company simultaneously lists as made in America while declaring in the product details that they are imported form outside the country: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In response to the TINA letter, Walmart told the group that manufacturing for both of these products was recently moved to the U.S. but that some stores may still contain versions made overseas and not all the information on the website is correct. Regardless, both items no longer carry the patriotic marketing message. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It wasn\u2019t just store-brand items that got the false \u201cMade in U.S.A.\u201d labels, according to the report. TINA\u2019s letter gives the example of an Almay eyeliner that states the product is made and assembled here in the U.S., even though the packaging declares that it is \u201cMade in Germany.\u201d Walmart says that the country of origin information comes from the supplier. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cFalse made in USA labeling on Walmart\u2019s website has misled consumers looking to purchase American-made products,\u2019\u2019 said TINA.org Executive Director Bonnie Patten. \u201cThe largest retailer in the world should have made sure its American-made claims were accurate before affixing made in USA labels on the products.

We are undertaking a more extensive quality assurance review to help eliminate these coding errors. Based on our initial internal review, we believe these errors are limited to a small percentage of items and we are confident in the overall integrity of the information on our website.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ============ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A more detailed report [PDF] commissioned by TINA looked at the actual \u201cMade in the U.S.A.\u201d labeling on Walmart.com and found a number of issues. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This report noted that Walmart does little to differentiate its \u201cMade in the U.S.A.\u201d label from its \u201cAssembled in the U.S.A.\u201d label, even though the two labels have very different standards in the eyes of the Federal Trade Commission. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThe legibility of the text at the top of the label, which can be either \u2018Made in the\u2019 or \u2018Assembled in the\u2019, is marginal even for people with excellent or corrected vision, due both to the text\u2019s small size and the low contrast of light blue text on a white background,\u201d writes the report\u2019s author, Dr. Jeff Johnson, who notes that the problem is exacerbated for farsighted people or those looking at the site on a small-format screen. \u201cIf such people have not seen it earlier in larger format (e.g., on a product page), they would be unable to determine what it says. Even consumers who have seen that text already in larger format would, in search results, have trouble distinguishing \u2018Made in the USA\u2019 from \u2018Assembled in the USA\u2019.\u201d\n",
        "summary": "\u2013 An advertising watchdog group warns you to beware of patriotic \"Made in the USA\" labels on some Walmart products, saying the company uses them far too liberally. The group Truth In Advertising sent Walmart CEO Doug McMillon a letter last week saying that \"Walmart's website is mired in USA labeling errors,\" and ran down a few examples, per the Consumerist: The company's store brand Equate Beauty Wedge Applicator Sponges, formerly labeled \"Made in the USA\" on the website, \"are made in China according to the product packaging,\" the letter says. Some \"USA\" labels conflict with the product information on the same Web page, according to the letter\u2014including Equate 7 Day Dental Whitening System Advanced Whitening Wraps (imported) and Almay Intense I-color Liquid Eye Liner (made in Germany). Some USA labels ignore the fact that the product is only partly made, or is assembled rather than made, in the US, the letter adds. \"False made in USA labeling on Walmart\u2019s website has misled consumers looking to purchase American-made products,\" says TINA.org Executive Director Bonnie Patten. In response, Walmart says the two Equate products only recently located in the US\u2014yet the \"Made in the USA\" label on them is now gone, the Consumerist notes. Walmart adds that it's undertaking \"a more extensive quality assurance review\" of its website. While there's no official standard for \"Made in the USA\" labeling, companies can get sued over it for false advertising, AGBeat reports.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Oscars: Nancy Motes killed herself to scupper her sister's Oscar chances, it has been claimed. Roberts, left, stars in the film with Meryl Streep, center In the months before her death, Nancy took aim at her famous sister on Twitter and one particular tweet apparently gives weight to the claim that she was plotting to hurt the Notting Hill star in some way. Nancy's death hasn't officially been ruled a suicide as a toxicology report has not been completed but her the family said in a statement that she died of 'an apparent drug overdose.' In December, an emotional Nancy mysteriously tweeted, apparently about Julia: 'Hey Hag! Glad you f****ed with me yet? You're going to LOVE what's coming! FYI-You're an awful, hate filled old pathetic excuse for a human.' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Conner's account comes after John Fraschetti, who also knows Nancy's grieving fianc\u00e9, claimed the family of the Oscar winner were now 'crying crocodile tears' over the former Glee production worker's death. He said they are only interested in manipulating public opinion after her suicide, but during her life, 'drove her to death.' Making the incendiary comments Tuesday outside Nancy and Dilbeck's home, Fraschetti said Nancy spiraled into depression after Betty Lou Motes, the mother she and Roberts shared, 'rejected' her six months ago - and that she 'just couldn't handle it anymore'. 'And then you get the actress woman who is pretending to grieve but she didn't want to deal with Nancy and made her f***ing miserable.' Nancy Motes was found dead on Sunday in a bathtub filled with water with prescription and 'illegal drugs' near her in an apparent suicide. Fraschetti claims to have seen the letter she left behind. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fraschetti, who has known Dilbeck since he was 13, said that since her death, her family have been careful to mold a favorable public reaction. 'They are crying crocodile tears. They have taken control of this situation, but they never cared of her when she was alive,' said Fraschetti. Fraschetti said that Nancy, 'couldn't stand the rejection of her mom, who in the last six months had cut her off entirely.' Upset: Julia Roberts' mother Betty Lou Motes is seen leaving her home in Los Angeles looking frail and upset Tuesday afternoon Cut-off: Nancy Motes is pictured in this photo with Julia Roberts when the Oscar winning actress was around 22 years old NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'It hurt her that none of her family wanted to be with her. She had a miserable Christmas, truly awful, and I think she just couldn't handle it anymore.' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fraschetti admitted that Nancy's well-documented problems with drugs and her weight had caused divisions, but claimed that to cut her off was unforgivable. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'They didn\u2019t care when she was alive. She was a handful, and yes she had her problems, but there\u2019s a way to deal with your relatives,' said an angry Fraschetti. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nancy's suicide note also reveals the true depths of depression that her family's rejection had sent her to. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'It read about how much she loved and cared for her fianc\u00e9 and how happy he made her, but it also said how unhappy and depressed her family made her and how she couldn\u2019t cope anymore,' said Fraschetti, who said that fianc\u00e9, Dilbeck, is grief stricken by Nancy's death and can't face the media. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Indicating that the suicide note goes into detail about how hurt she felt by being ignored, Fraschetti said that Roberts and her family even put pressure on Dilbeck to delete tweets. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But, it was revealed last night that Nancy had apparently tweeted a string of vicious messages aimed at her Oscar winning sister, including 'Just so you all know \"America's Sweetheart\" is a B****!!' on January 20. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That and others were indeed deleted overnight. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Friend: John Fraschetti has known Nancy Motes' fiance John Dilbeck since he was 13 and says that Julia Roberts and her family cutting off Nancy caused her suicide NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'We've got a person who is grieving so much, but then there is the other so called family who are grieving, so to speak, who want to see as little grief as possible for them,' said Fraschetti. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'It's the rich versus the poor, the fake versus the real, he's the one who's in agony, he's the one that's genuine.' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And in an apparent confirmation that she did indeed commit suicide, Fraschetti said that her death was planned, but that she didn't use heroin like Philip Seymour Hoffman. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She wasn\u2019t into heroin, as far as I was aware. It\u2019s not like her or John were heroin addicts. Come on, it\u2019s ridiculous. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u2018I wouldn\u2019t read too much into where she did it, it wasn\u2019t in some drug den. She was dog sitting, and I imagine she did this, so she didn\u2019t have to do it at home and let John find her.' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And this afternoon, Julia Roberts' grief-stricken mother looked frail and visibly shaken as she visited the Oscar-winner following the apparent suicide death of her younger daughter, Nancy Motes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dressed in a tartan hat and black jacket, Betty Lou Motes was driven by a friend from her home in Pacific Palisades to Julia's mansion in Malibu.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Her fianc\u00e9 discovered her body, which had been dead as long as 12 hours, but a responding EMT worker recovered the extensive letter, according to the New York Daily News. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the note, Nancy dedicated three pages to her tortured relationship with the Pretty Woman actress, the Daily News quoted a source close to the investigation as saying.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Anthony Scaramucci finally has his White House job, but he still stands to profit from an ownership stake in his investment firm SkyBridge Capital. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The incoming White House communications director earned $4.9 million from his ownership stake in SkyBridge in addition to more than $5 million in salary between Jan. 1, 2016, and the end of June, when he joined the Export-Import Bank, according to a financial disclosure filed with the Office of Government Ethics. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Story Continued Below NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The disclosure form, which is publicly available upon request, hasn\u2019t been previously reported. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The disclosure highlights the extensive wealth Scaramucci has accumulated in his career \u2014 much like many of Trump\u2019s other top advisers and Cabinet secretaries \u2014 and also the challenge he faces in extracting himself from the potential conflicts his investments could pose. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Scaramucci\u2019s financial filing values SkyBridge Capital at more than $50 million and states that he owns nearly 44 percent of the firm. When the sale of the company is completed, expected to be in the third quarter of this year, he will receive \u201cthe agreed-upon purchase price for his share of the sale proceeds,\u201d according to the filing.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cIt\u2019s black and white that he\u2019s going to get money,\u201d said Austin Evers, executive director at American Oversight, a watchdog group that focuses on transparency in government. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The SkyBridge website continues to advertise Scaramucci as the firm's managing director, despite the fact that he has been a government employee for more than a month. A SkyBridge spokeswoman said Scaramucci stepped down from the executive post Jan. 17, when the company\u2019s sale was announced. He remained an employee of the firm, collecting a salary, until starting at Ex-Im last month. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The investment firm, which Scaramucci founded in 2005, is in the process of being sold to RON Transatlantic and Chinese conglomerate HNA Group.

Treasury spokeswoman Marisol Garibay did not respond to requests for comment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Scaramucci, a Trump fundraiser and frequent campaign surrogate whose appointment to an administration post was delayed in part because of the complicated nature of the SkyBridge sale, joined Ex-Im in June. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ex-Im was seen as a \"very temporary move,\" a way to get the Trump loyalist to Washington until a higher-level position could be found, according to one White House adviser. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The bank is across the street from the White House, where Scaramucci was free to come and go thanks to security credentials that gave him 24-hour access.

While some Sanders supporters had been hoping for a vice presidential nomination for him, Sanders himself wouldn't be interested in the position anyway, according to a source close to him. CNN reports Sanders would rather work to change the Democratic party from the Senate than be seen as a \"sell-out\" or Clinton's \"partner.\" That may explain the interest in Warren, whose policies are close to those of Sanders and who could possibly bring some of his supporters over to Clinton. Bustle calls her a \"shiny apple to Sanders' orange.\" Sources close to Clinton say the top priority for a running mate is someone who would be ready to step in as president, and that advisers aren't really looking at what a nominee does for Clinton's campaign in terms of demographics and geography.\n"

        "document": "More from this journal ||||| Colorectal cancer is often considered a disease that affects primarily older men, yet this perception may be changing. An extensive analysis of recent data showed that one in every seven colorectal cancer patients was younger than 50. The University of Michigan study raises questions about the current guidelines to begin screening at age 50. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Signs of colorectal cancer, often called the \u201csymptomless cancer,\u201d include anemia, a dramatic change in the size or frequency of bowel movements, and dark blood or blood mixed with stool, (sometimes appearing as black threads), in bowel movements. Because these symptoms may be nonexistent, mild, or infrequent, many people are not aware of their condition until their malignancy becomes advanced and spreads into the lymph nodes. A colonoscopy is the usual screening test, but stool tests are also effective for some people. If you are worried, you can request your primary care physician provide you with one of these simple stool tests, no matter your age. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Younger Patients Increasing NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Seeing a recent rise in cancer cases among younger people, a team led by Dr. Samantha Hendren conducted a study of the nationally representative Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program of the National Cancer Insitute to assess age and treatment patterns among colorectal patients. Specifically, they gathered and analyzed data from patients diagnosed in the United States between 1998 and 2011. Their results point to important changes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Of more than 258,000 total colorectal cancer patients, 37,847 (about 15 percent) were younger than 50. These younger-than-expected patients were more likely to be diagnosed with either regional or distant malignancies, both of which are more dangerous than localized tumors. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In terms of treatment, younger patients suffering with a distant metastasis \u2014 where the cancer has spread from an original tumor \u2014 were more likely to undergo surgery than older patients; 72 percent versus 63 percent. Radiation therapy was more likely to be used with younger rectal cancer patients than in older patients; 53 percent versus 48 percent. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By various measures, younger patients saw more positive results. Despite the tendency to have more advanced disease when diagnosed, younger-than-50 colorectal cancer patients overall lived slightly longer without a cancer recurrence. With regard to localized disease, the five-year survival rate was 95.1 percent for younger patients versus 91.9 percent for older patients, with regard to regional disease, 76 percent versus 70.3 percent, and with regard to distant disease 21.3 percent versus 14.1 percent. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThese findings suggest the need for improved risk assessment and screening decisions for younger adults,\u201d wrote the researchers in the study. They believe their work is a wake-up call to the medical community, which should be looking for the signs of colorectal cancer in patients younger than 50. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If age 50 is maintained as the recommended time to begin screening, this study suggests that nearly 15 percent of all patients may be caught late in the process of disease. By comparison, breast cancer screening is recommended to begin at age 40. Less than 5 percent of invasive breast cancers occur in women under that age. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Source: Abdelsattar Z, Wong S, Regenbogen S, et al. Colorectal Cancer Outcomes and Treatment Patterns in Patients Too Young for Average-Risk Screening. CANCER. 2016. ||||| (Reuters Health) - One in seven colon and rectal cancers in the U.S. are now diagnosed in patients younger than age 50, which is when people are advised to begin routine screenings for these tumors, a new study finds. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By 2030, nearly one in four rectal tumors and more than one in 10 colon cancers will be diagnosed in people under 50, researchers estimate in the journal Cancer. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cColorectal cancer has traditionally been thought of as a disease of the elderly; this study is really a wake-up call to the medical community that a relatively large number of colorectal cancers are occurring in young people,\u201d said senior study author Dr. Samantha Hendren of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Researchers analyzed cancer registry data from 1998 to 2011 for about 258,000 patients with colorectal tumors and found that 37,847 of them, or almost 15 percent, were diagnosed before age 50. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Compared with older patients, those under 50 were 30 percent more likely to be diagnosed with tumors that had spread to the lymph nodes and 50 percent more likely to have cancer that had advanced to other organs, the study found. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Younger patients with tumors that had metastasized, or reached other organs, were also more likely than older people to get more aggressive treatments. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR About 72 percent of people under 50 got surgery, compared with 63 percent of older individuals. And while 53 percent of younger patients received radiation, just 48 percent of older people did. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Even though patients diagnosed younger tended to have more aggressive disease, they also lived slightly longer without tumors returning after their initial course of treatment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Five-year survival odds were about 95 percent for patients under 50 diagnosed with local tumors that hadn\u2019t spread yet, compared to roughly 92 percent for older people. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With tumors that spread to the lymph nodes, five-year survival rates were 76 percent for young people and 70 percent for older patients, while with cancers that metastasized to other organs the survival odds were 21 percent versus 14 percent, respectively. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One shortcoming of the study is that researchers lacked data on family history and other risk factors for colorectal cancers, the authors note. It\u2019s also possible that treatment choices and overall survival were influenced by what\u2019s known as selection bias, when healthier people may get more interventions and have better outcomes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Often, patients may get an early warning of colorectal tumors with symptoms such as bleeding, changes in bowel habits or pain when going to the bathroom that can point to the need for diagnostic screening, said Dr. Joel Randolph Hecht, director of the gastrointestinal oncology program at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California Los Angeles. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cUnfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\u201d Hecht, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study, said by email. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There are guidelines for screening some people starting at age 40 if they have a family history of colorectal cancer, noted Dr. Sidney Winawer of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cWithout a family history, physicians need to use their judgment when seeing young people who have bowel symptoms and refer those of concern to a gastroenterologist for a diagnostic workup, \u201c Winawer, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study, added by email. \u201cThis is difficult since we do not wish to expose young people to unnecessary tests.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It isn\u2019t clear from the study findings, however, whether changing preventive screening guidelines to start at a younger age would ultimately prevent more cancer deaths, said Dr. David Weinberg, chairman of medicine at the Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cIf the goal of screening is disease prevention, as it generally is for colorectal cancer, it is not clear when screening should start,\u201d Weinberg, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study, said by email. \u201cToo early and the yield of screening will be very low since young people are still less likely to get colorectal cancer than older people.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR SOURCE: bit.ly/23o5QvC Cancer, online January 25, 2016. ||||| MONDAY, Jan. 25, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- Colon cancer rates are rising among men and women under 50, the age at which guidelines recommend screenings start, a new analysis shows. One in seven colon cancer patients is under 50. Younger patients are more likely to have advanced stage cancer, but they live slightly longer without a cancer recurrence because they are treated aggressively, the researchers reported. \"Colon cancer has traditionally been thought of as a disease of the elderly,\" said study lead author Dr. Samantha Hendren, an associate professor of surgery at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This study is really a wake-up call to the medical community that a relatively large number of colon cancers are occurring in people under 50,\" she added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However, Hendren said it's too soon to say whether colon cancer screening guidelines should be altered to reflect that trend. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the analysis, colon cancer among younger patients was often found at an advanced stage, meaning the disease has spread to lymph nodes or other organs. \"Part of the reason for this is that these young patients are often diagnosed only after their cancers start to cause symptoms, such as anemia, bowel bleeding or a blockage in the colon,\" Hendren explained. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Doctors should be on the lookout for these warning signs of colon cancer, she added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Not all bowel bleeding is caused by cancer, she said. \"Bright red bleeding with a bowel movement is usually due to hemorrhoids or fissures, but dark blood or blood mixed with the stool is a warning sign,\" Hendren said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR People with a family history of colon cancer and others who are at higher risk should begin screening earlier than the age of 50, she said. \"This is already recommended, but we don't think this is happening consistently, and this is something we need to optimize,\" she added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The report was published online Jan. 25 in the journal Cancer. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dr. Andrew Chan, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School in Boston, said the reasons for the increase in colon cancer among younger adults isn't known. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It is unexplained,\" he said. \"It's not simply a change in diagnoses, it's a very real increase. There may be an effect of our environment that could be contributing to the increase.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Smoking, obesity and physical inactivity are all risk factors for colon cancer, as is a poor diet, Chan said. \"When we are faced with patients who have many of these elements, we should think more about the potential of them developing colon cancer at an earlier age,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For the study, Hendren and her colleagues culled federal government data on nearly 260,000 patients diagnosed with colon cancer between 1998 and 2011. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Of these patients, nearly 15 percent were younger than 50. These patients were more likely to be diagnosed with advanced cancer and more likely to have surgery than older patients (72 percent versus 63 percent). Radiation therapy was also used more often in younger patients than in older patients (53 percent versus 48 percent), the researchers found. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Younger patients lived a little longer without a cancer recurrence, even though they tended to have more advanced cancer, Hendren said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For patients under 50, about 68 percent survived five years, while about 67 percent of the patients 50 and older survived five years, she said. \"It looks like patients' young age helps them in their cancer treatment and survival,\" she added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR These findings raise the question of whether screening for colon cancer should begin at an earlier age, Hendren said. \"This would be a big and costly change, and I don't know whether it would help more people than it would hurt, so a lot of research would be required to understand this before any changes should be made,\" she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Chan noted that although the incidence of colon cancer is increasing among people under 50, the risk is still low. \"I don't think the data at this point support expanding screening to younger age groups,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hendren said that \"the cancer community needs to prepare for the increasing number of very young colorectal cancer survivors who will need long-term support to cope with the physical and psychological consequences of their disease and treatments.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR More information NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Visit the U.S. National Cancer Institute for more on colon cancer.\n",

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says. More screenings for young people might help, but the yield would be low because under-50s are still less likely to get colon cancer. \"This would be a big and costly change,\" says Hendren, who recommends \"a lot of research\" be done first.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Further cabling inside was under way before an attempt to restart water pumps needed to cool overheated nuclear fuel rods at the six-reactor Fukushima plant in northeastern Japan, 240 km (150 miles) north of Tokyo. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Japan's unprecedented multiple crisis of earthquake, tsunami and radiation leak has unsettled world financial markets, prompted international reassessment of nuclear safety and given the Asian nation its sternest test since World War Two. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It has also stirred unhappy memories of Japan's past nuclear nightmare -- the U.S. atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Working inside a 20 km (12 miles) evacuation zone at Fukushima, nearly 300 engineers were focused on trying to find a solution by restoring power to pumps in four of the reactors. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"TEPCO has connected the external transmission line with the receiving point of the plant and confirmed that electricity can be supplied,\" the plant's operator Tokyo Electric Power Co said in a statement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Another 1,480 meters (5,000 feet) of cable are being laid inside the complex before engineers try to crank up the coolers at reactor No.2, followed by numbers 1, 3 and 4 this weekend, company officials said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If that works it will be a turning point. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"If they are successful in getting the cooling infrastructure up and running, that will be a significant step forward in establishing stability,\" said Eric Moore, a nuclear power expert at U.S.-based FocalPoint Consulting Group. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If not, there is an option of last resort under consideration to bury the sprawling 40-year-old plant in sand and concrete to prevent a catastrophic radiation release. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That method was used to seal huge leakages from the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Underlining authorities' desperation, fire trucks sprayed water overnight in a crude tactic to cool reactor No.3, considered the most critical because of its use of mixed oxides, or mox, containing both uranium and highly toxic plutonium. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Japan has raised the severity rating of the nuclear crisis to level 5 from 4 on the seven-level INES international scale, putting it on a par with the Three Mile Island accident in 1979, although some experts say it is more serious. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Chernobyl, in Ukraine, was a 7 on that scale. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR THOUSANDS DEAD, MISSING AND SUFFERING NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The operation to avert large-scale radiation has overshadowed the humanitarian aftermath of the 9.0-magnitude quake and 10-meter (33-foot) tsunami that struck on March 11. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nearly 7,000 people have been confirmed killed in the double natural disaster, which turned whole towns into waterlogged and debris-shrouded wastelands. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Another 10,700 people are missing with many feared dead. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some 390,000 people, including many among Japan's aging population, are homeless and battling near-freezing temperatures in shelters in northeastern coastal areas. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Food, water, medicine and heating fuel are in short supply.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Health officials and the U.N. atomic watchdog have said radiation levels in the capital Tokyo were not harmful. But the city has seen an exodus of tourists, expatriates and many Japanese, who fear a blast of radioactive material. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I'm leaving because my parents are terrified. I personally think this will turn out to be the biggest paper tiger the world has ever seen,\" said Luke Ridley, 23, from London as he sat at Narita international airport using his laptop. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I'll probably come back in about a month.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Though there has been alarm around the world, experts have been warning there is little risk of radiation at dangerous levels spreading to other nations. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The U.S. government said \"minuscule\" amounts of radiation were detected in California consistent with a release from Japan's damaged facility, but there were no levels of concern. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Amid their distress, Japanese were proud of the 279 nuclear plant workers toiling in the wreckage, wearing masks, goggles and protective suits sealed by duct tape.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The dollar surged to 81.98 yen on Friday after the G7 moved to pour billions into markets buying dollars, euros and pounds -- the first such joint intervention since the group came to the aid of the newly launched euro in 2000. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The dollar later dropped back to under 81 yen, but it was still far from the record low of 76.25 yen hit on Thursday.

But they couldn't be sure any of it was easing the peril at the tsunami-ravaged facility. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (SCROLL DOWN FOR LIVE UPDATES) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Three reactors have had at least partial meltdowns, but an even greater danger has emerged. Japanese and U.S. concerns were increasingly focusing on the pools used to store spent nuclear fuel: Some of the pools are dry or nearly empty and the rods could heat up and spew radiation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It could take days and \"possibly weeks\" to get the complex under control, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission Chairman Gregory Jazcko said. He defended the U.S. decision to recommend a 50-mile evacuation zone for its citizens, a much stronger measure than Japan has taken. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A senior official with the U.N.'s nuclear safety agency said there had been \"no significant worsening\" at the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant but that the situation remained \"very serious.\" Graham Andrew told reporters in Vienna that nuclear fuel rods in two reactors were only about half covered with water, and in a third they were also not completely submerged. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If the fuel is not fully covered, rising temperatures and pressure will increase the chances of complete meltdowns that would release much larger amounts of radioactive material than the failing plant has emitted so far. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Low levels of radiation have been detected well beyond Tokyo, which is 140 miles (220 kilometers) south of the plant, but hazardous levels have been limited to the plant itself. Still, the crisis triggered by last week's earthquake and tsunami has forced thousands to evacuate and drained Tokyo's normally vibrant streets of life, its residents either leaving town or holing up in their homes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR President Barack Obama appeared on television to assure Americans that officials do not expect harmful amounts of radiation to reach the U.S. or its territories. He also said the U.S. was offering Japan any help it could provide, and said he was asking for a comprehensive review of U.S. nuclear plant safety. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Japanese and American assessments of the crisis have differed, with the plant's owner denying Jazcko's report Wednesday that Unit 4's spent fuel pool was dry and that anyone who gets close to the plant could face potentially lethal doses of radiation. But a Tokyo Electric Power Co. executive moved closer to the U.S. position Thursday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Considering the amount of radiation released in the area, the fuel rods are more likely to be exposed than to be covered,\" Yuichi Sato said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Workers have been dumping seawater when possible to control temperatures at the plant since the quake and tsunami knocked out power to its cooling systems, but they tried even more desperate measures on Unit 3's reactor and cooling pool. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Two Japanese military CH-47 Chinook helicopters began dumping seawater on Unit 3 on Thursday morning, defense ministry spokeswoman Kazumi Toyama said. The choppers doused the reactor with at least four loads of water in just the first 10 minutes, though television footage showed much of it appearing to disperse in the wind. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Chopper crews flew missions of about 40 minutes each to limit their radiation exposure, passing over the reactor with loads of about 2,000 gallons (7,500 liters) of water. Another 9,000 gallons (35,000 liters) of water were blasted from military trucks with high-pressure sprayers used to extinguish fires at plane crashes, though the vehicles had to stay safely back from areas deemed to have too much radiation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Special police units with water cannons were also tried, but they could not reach the targets from safe distances and had to pull back, said Yasuhiro Hashimoto, a spokesman for Japan's nuclear safety agency. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Unit 3's reactor uses a fuel that combines plutonium, better known as an ingredient in nuclear weapons, and reprocessed uranium. The presence of this mixed oxide fuel, or MOX, means potentially that two very harmful radioactive products could be released into the environment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tokyo Electric Power said it believed workers were making headway in staving off a catastrophe both with the spraying and, especially, with efforts to complete an emergency power line to restart the plant's own electric cooling systems. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This is a first step toward recovery,\" said Teruaki Kobayashi, a facilities management official at the power company. He said radiation levels \"have somewhat stabilized at their lows\" and that some of the spraying had reached its target, with one reactor emitting steam. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We are doing all we can as we pray for the situation to improve,\" Kobayashi said. Authorities planned to spray again Friday, and Kobayashi said: \"Choices are limited. We just have to stick to what we can do most quickly and efficiently.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Work on connecting the new power line to the plant was expected to begin Friday and take 10 to 15 hours, said Nuclear Safety Agency spokesman Minoru Ohgoda. But the utility is not sure the cooling systems will still function. If they don't, electricity won't help. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Four of the plant's six reactors have seen fires, explosions, damage to the structures housing reactor cores, partial meltdowns or rising temperatures. Officials also recently said temperatures are rising even in the spent fuel pools of the other two reactors. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The troubles at the nuclear complex were set in motion by last Friday's 9.0-magnitude earthquake and tsunami, which knocked out power and destroyed backup generators needed for the reactors' cooling systems. That added a nuclear crisis on top of twin natural disasters that likely killed well more than 10,000 people and left hundreds of thousands homeless. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mario V. Bonaca, a physicist sits on an advisory committee to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, said he believes the focus of the effort has shifted to the spent fuel pools. \"I understand that they've controlled the cooling of the cores,\" said Bonaca, who said he was basing his understanding on NRC and industry sources. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The storage pools need a constant source of cooling water. Even when removed from reactors, uranium rods are still extremely hot and must be cooled for months, possibly longer, to prevent them from heating up again and emitting radioactivity. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While a core team of 180 emergency workers has been rotating in and out of the complex to avoid exposure, experts said that anyone working close to the reactors was almost certainly being exposed to radiation levels that could, at least, give them much higher cancer risks. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Experts note, though, that radiation levels drop quickly with distance from the complex. While elevated radiation has been detected well outside the evacuation zone, experts say those levels are not dangerous. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR U.S. officials were taking no chances.

(Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Four of the troubled Fukushima Dai-ichi plant's six reactor units have seen fires, explosions or partial meltdowns in the week since the tsunami. While the reactor cores where energy is generated are a concern, water in the pools used to store used nuclear fuel are also major worries. Water in at least one fuel pool _ in the complex's Unit 3 _ is believed to be dangerously low, exposing the stored fuel rods. Without enough water, the rods may heat further and spew out radiation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We see it as an extremely serious accident,\" Yukiya Amano, the head of the U.N.'s International Atomic Energy Agency, told reporters Friday just after arriving in Tokyo. \"This is not something that just Japan should deal with, and people of the entire world should cooperate with Japan and the people in the disaster areas.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Frantic efforts were made Thursday to douse a number of units with water, and authorities were preparing to repeat many of those efforts. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Friday's smoke came from the complex's Unit 2, and its cause was not known, the nuclear safety agency said. An explosion had hit the building on Tuesday, possibly damaging a crucial cooling chamber that sits below the reactor core. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Last week's 9.0 quake and tsunami in Japan's northeast set off the nuclear problems by knocking out power to cooling systems at the reactors. The unfolding crises have led to power shortages in Japan, forced auto and other factories to close, sending shockwaves through global manufacturing and trade, and triggered a plunge in Japanese stock prices. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Low levels of radiation have been detected well beyond Tokyo, which is 140 miles (220 kilometers) south of the plant, but hazardous levels have been limited to the plant itself. Still, the crisis has forced thousands to evacuate and drained Tokyo's normally vibrant streets of life, its residents either leaving town or holing up in their homes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Japanese government has been slow in releasing information on the crisis, even as the troubles have multiplied. In a country where the nuclear industry has a long history of hiding its safety problems, this has left many people _ in Japan and among governments overseas _ confused and anxious. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I feel a sense of dread,\" said Yukiko Morioka, 63, who has seen business dry up at her lottery ticket booth in Tokyo. \"I'm not an expert, so it's difficult to understand what's going on. That makes it scarier.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A senior official with the U.N. nuclear agency said Thursday there had been \"no significant worsening\" at the nuclear plant but that the situation remained \"very serious.\" Graham Andrew told reporters in Vienna that nuclear fuel rods in two reactors were only about half covered with water, and they were also not completely submerged in a third. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Edano said Friday that Tokyo is asking the U.S. government for help and that the two are discussing the specifics. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We are coordinating with the U.S. government as to what the U.S. can provide and what people really need,\" Edano said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At times, the two close allies have offered starkly differing assessments over the dangers at Fukushima. U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission Chairman Gregory Jazcko said Thursday that it could take days and \"possibly weeks\" to get the complex under control. He defended the U.S. decision to recommend a 50-mile (80-kilometer) evacuation zone for its citizens, wider than the 30-mile (50-kilometer) band Japan has ordered. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Crucial to the effort to regain control over the Fukushima plant is laying a new power line to the plant, allowing operators to restore cooling systems. The operator, Tokyo Electric Power Co., missed a deadline late Thursday but said Friday that workers hoped to complete the effort in 10 to 15 hours, said nuclear safety agency spokesman Minoru Ohgoda. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But the utility is not sure the cooling systems will still function. If they don't, electricity won't help. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The official death toll from the disasters stood at 6,405 as of Friday morning, with 10,259 missing, the national police agency said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR President Barack Obama appeared on television to assure Americans that officials do not expect harmful amounts of radiation to reach the U.S. or its territories. He also said the U.S. was offering Japan any help it could provide. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A utility official said Wednesday that the company has been unable to get information such as water levels and temperatures from any of the spent fuel pools in the four most troubled reactors. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Workers have been dumping seawater when possible to control temperatures at the plant since the quake and tsunami knocked out power to its cooling systems, but they tried even more desperate measures on Units 3 and 4. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Thursday, military helicopters dumped thousands of gallons of water from huge buckets onto Unit 3, and also used military firefighting trucks normally used to extinguish fires at plane crashes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Officials announced Friday they would not continue with the helicopter drops _ televised footage appeared to show much of that water blowing away _ but would continue spraying from the trucks. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Police said more than 452,000 people made homeless by the quake and tsunami were staying in schools and other shelters, as supplies of fuel, medicine and other necessities ran short. Both victims and aid workers appealed for more help, as the chances of finding more survivors dwindled. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At the Fukushima Dai-ichi plant, a core team of 180 emergency workers has been rotating out of the complex to minimize radiation exposure. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The storage pools need a constant source of cooling water. Even when removed from reactors, uranium rods are still extremely hot and must be cooled for months, possibly longer, to prevent them from heating up again and emitting radioactivity. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In Washington, the State Department warned U.S. citizens to consider leaving the country and offered voluntary evacuation to family members and dependents of U.S. personnel in the cities of Tokyo, Yokohama and Nagoya. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ___ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Yamaguchi reported from Tokyo. Associated Press writers George Jahn in Vienna, Elaine Kurtenbach, Shino Yuasa, Jeff Donn and Tim Sullivan in Tokyo contributed to this report. ||||| While the findings were reassuring in the short term, the United States declined to back away from its warning to Americans there to stay at least 50 miles from the plant, setting up a far larger perimeter than the Japanese government had established. American officials did not release specific radiation readings. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR American officials said their biggest worry was that a frenetic series of efforts by the Japanese military to get water into four of the plant\u2019s six reactors \u2014 including using water cannons and firefighting helicopters that dropped water but appeared to largely miss their targets \u2014 showed few signs of working. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThis is something that will likely take some time to work through, possibly weeks, as eventually you remove the majority of the heat from the reactors and then the spent fuel pool,\u201d said Gregory Jaczko, the chairman of the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission , briefing reporters at the White House. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The effort by the Japanese to hook some electric power back up to the plant did not begin until Thursday and even if they succeed, it is unclear whether the cooling systems, in reactor buildings battered by a tsunami and then torn apart by hydrogen explosions, survived the crisis in good enough shape to be useful. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cWhat you are seeing are desperate efforts \u2014 just throwing everything at it in hopes something will work,\u201d said one American official with long nuclear experience who would not speak for attribution. \u201cRight now this is more prayer than plan.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Thursday, President Obama said that the crisis had convinced him to order the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to do a comprehensive review of the safety of nuclear plants in the United States. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After a day in which American and Japanese officials gave radically different assessments of the danger from the nuclear plant, the two governments tried on Thursday to join forces. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement Continue reading the main story NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Experts met in Tokyo to compare notes. The United States, with Japanese permission, began to put the intelligence-collection aircraft over the site, in hopes of gaining a view for Washington as well as its allies in Tokyo that did not rely on the announcements of officials from the Tokyo Electric Power Company, which operates Fukushima Daiichi. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR American officials say they suspect that the company has consistently underestimated the risk and moved too slowly to contain the damage. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Aircraft normally used to monitor North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons activities \u2014 a Global Hawk drone and U-2 spy planes \u2014 were flying missions over the reactor, trying to help the Japanese government map out its response to last week\u2019s 9.0-magnitude earthquake, the tsunami that followed and now the nuclear disaster. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR President Obama made an unscheduled stop at the Japanese Embassy to sign a condolence book, writing, \u201cMy heart goes out to the people of Japan during this enormous tragedy.\u201d He added, \u201cBecause of the strength and wisdom of its people, we know that Japan will recover, and indeed will emerge stronger than ever.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Later, he appeared in the Rose Garden at the White House to offer continued American support for the earthquake and tsunami victims, and technical help at the nuclear site. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Video NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But before the recovery can begin, the nuclear plant must be brought under control. On Friday, steam that was likely laced with radioactive particles was again rising over the plant, this time billowing from reactor No. 2, which suffered an explosion Tuesday. But Japanese authorities said they did not yet know the cause of the latest release. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR American officials, meanwhile, remained fixated on the temperature readings inside that reactor and two others that had been operating until the earthquake shut them down, as well as at the plant\u2019s spent fuel pools, looking for any signs that their high levels of heat were going down. If the fuel rods are uncovered and exposed to air, they heat up and can burst into flames, spewing radioactive elements. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So far the officials saw no signs of dropping temperatures. And the Web site of the International Atomic Energy Agency , the United Nations nuclear watchdog, made it clear that there were no readings at all from some critical areas. Part of the American effort, by satellites and aircraft, is to identify the hot spots, something the Japanese have not been able to do in some cases.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement Continue reading the main story NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Daniel B. Poneman, the deputy secretary of energy, said at a White House briefing on Thursday that preliminary results of the initial flights \u201care consistent with the recommendations that came down from the chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission,\u201d which led to the 50-mile evacuation guideline given to American expatriates. Although the worst contamination is closer to the plant, the recommendation takes into account the possibility of shifting winds or greater emissions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The State Department has also said it would fly out of the country any dependents of American diplomats or military personnel within the region of the plant and as far south as Tokyo. Space will be made for other Americans who cannot get a flight, it said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Getting the Japanese to accept the American detection equipment was a delicate diplomatic maneuver, which some Japanese officials originally resisted. But as it became clear that conditions at the plant were spinning out of control, and with Japanese officials admitting they had little hard evidence about whether there was water in the cooling pools or breaches in the reactor containment structures, they began to accept more help. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The sensors on the instrument pod are good at mapping radioactive isotopes, like cesium 137, which has been detected around the nuclear plant and has a half-life of 30 years. In high doses, it can cause acute radiation sickness . Lower doses can alter cellular function, leading to an increased risk of cancer . NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cesium 137 can enter the body through many foods, including milk. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Wednesday, when the American Embassy in Tokyo, on advice from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, told Americans to evacuate a radius of \u201capproximately 50 miles\u201d around the Fukushima plant, the recommendation was based on a specific calculation of risk of radioactive fallout in the affected area. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a statement, the commission said the advice grew out of its assessment that projected radiation doses within the evacuation zone might exceed one rem to the body or five rems to the thyroid gland. That organ is extremely sensitive to iodine 131 \u2014 another of the deadly byproducts of nuclear fuel, this one causing thyroid cancer . NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The commission says that the average American is exposed to about 0.62 rem of radiation each year from natural and manmade sources. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The American-provided instruments in Japan measure real levels of radiation on the ground. In contrast, scientists around the world have also begun to draw up forecasts of how the prevailing winds pick up the Japanese radioactive material and carry it over the Pacific in invisible plumes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement Continue reading the main story NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Private analysts said the United States was also probably monitoring the reactor crisis with spy satellites that can spot the heat from fires \u2014 helping it independently assess the state of the reactor complex from a distance. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jeffrey G. Lewis, an intelligence specialist at the Monterey Institute, a research center, noted that the Japanese assessment of Reactor No. 4 at the Daiichi complex seemed to depend in part on visual surveillance by helicopter pilots. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cI\u2019ve got to think that, if we put our best assets into answering that question, we can do better,\u201d he said in an interview. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One main concern at No. 4 has been a fire that was burning there earlier in the week; American officials are not convinced that the fire has gone out. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR American officials have also worried that the spent-fuel pool at that reactor has run dry, exposing the rods. Japanese officials, however, have concentrated much of their recent efforts on Reactor No. 3, which has been intermittently releasing radiation from what the authorities believe may be a ruptured containment vessel around the reactor. Temperatures at that reactor\u2019s spent fuel pool are also high. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Perhaps because of the difficulties experienced Thursday trying to accurately drop water from helicopters, the Japanese military announced Friday that it was halting those efforts for at least a day.\n",

I have not had a drink for several years now. I don\u2019t say this to boast, merely to put in context what follows. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I remember one hungover December morning telling a colleague at the magazine where I was working at the time that I was planning to stay off the drink for a month in the new year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cWhy on earth would you do that?\u201d he replied. \u201cA few drinks are the only thing that get you through January, it\u2019s so bloody miserable.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He wasn\u2019t an addict, so he didn\u2019t understand the allure of a sober January to someone who was \u2013 that the idea of getting obliterated over Christmas and New Year and then \"white-knuckling\" it for a month before picking up where you left off is deeply appealing to the classic all-or-nothing, getting-away-with-it mentality of the addict. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I managed several sober Januarys and they became an important weapon in my armoury of denial. Me, an alcoholic? Hardly! How could I manage to stay off drink for a month if I was? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I find it particularly depressing that this year, the idea of a dry January is being promoted by the UK\u2019s biggest alcohol charity, the always well-intentioned Alcohol Concern. Although the charity is careful to state in small print at the bottom of its webpage that the challenge should \"not be attempted by people with an alcohol dependency problem\" unfortunately those are exactly the kind of people a promotion like this will attract. Year after year, the only mates that I could persuade to do a sober January with me were the ones who were as bad as or worse than me. The normals, like my co-worker, were never interested. Why would they be? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If you are worried about the amount you have been drinking, the answer is not to swear off drink for a month. The answer is to try and establish whether you do really have a problem. And the best way to do that, ironically enough, is to do some drinking. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This was the course of action recommended by Bill Wilson, the co-founder of the self-help movement Alcoholics Anonymous. Wilson believed that alcoholics suffer a kind of allergic reaction to alcohol, and that once they start drinking they develop an overwhelming craving for more. This craving, he thought, is only made worse by subsequent attempts to satisfy it with more drink, like an itch that gets worse the more you scratch it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Wilson\u2019s alcoholism test is remarkably simple, and does not involve any boxes to tick or medical examinations or liver function tests; it just requires a modicum of honesty. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cWe do not like to pronounce any individual as alcoholic, but you can quickly diagnose yourself,\u201d he wrote. \u201cStep over to the nearest barroom and try some controlled drinking. Try to drink and stop abruptly. Try more than once. It will not take long for you to decide, if you are honest with yourself about it.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So - unless your sole aim is to save cash - don't challenge yourself to a sober January. Anyone can do that. Try having a pint every night \u2013 but just one \u2013 if you really want to prove you don\u2019t have a problem. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As my friend said all those years ago, January sucks - just look at the weather outside - and you normals should have all the help you can to get through it. ||||| Create an account for free access to: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR First name NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Last name NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Please select a country...

As a recovering alcoholic, Sykes should know. \"I managed several sober Januaries, and they became an important weapon in my armory of denial,\" he writes. A real alcoholic, after all, couldn't make it, he reasoned. But the truth is the ritual appeals deeply \"to the classic all-or-nothing, getting-away-with-it mentality of the addict,\" while \"normals\" have no use for it. He advises instead trying to have just one drink a night\u2014if stopping after one is difficult, you'll know you have a problem. But if you actually are a \"normal,\" it turns out there might be some merit in the month-long detox. The staff at the New Scientist ran a small-scale test on themselves, and got some pretty astonishing results. Ten staffers laid off booze for five weeks, and saw their liver fat, blood glucose, and blood cholesterol levels all fall significantly\u2014reducing their risk for liver disease, diabetes, and heart disease\u2014while four staffers who kept drinking saw no changes. But it was a fairly limited experiment, offering no clue how long those effects will last. Heather Timmons at Quartz argues that such \"detoxes\" are \"useless\" in the long-term, since the body regularly clears out toxins all on its own. So instead, she recommends taking two or three consecutive days off from drinking each week, since it takes the liver a full day to recover from heavy drinking\u2014plus, over the course of a year, that ensures as many as 150 alcohol-free days.\n"

        "document": "This undated image made available by the Oregon Health & Science University in May 2013 shows a stem cell colony developed from cloned human embryos. Scientists have finally recovered stem cells from... (Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Scientists have finally recovered stem cells from cloned human embryos, a longstanding goal that could lead to new treatments for such illnesses as Parkinson's disease and diabetes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A prominent expert called the work a landmark, but noted that a different, simpler technique now under development may prove more useful. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Stem cells can turn into any cell of the body, so scientists are interested in using them to create tissue for treating disease. Transplanting brain tissue might treat Parkinson's disorder, for example, and pancreatic tissue might be used for diabetes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But transplants run the risk of rejection, so more than a decade ago, researchers proposed a way around that: Create tissue from stem cells that bear the patient's own DNA, obtained with a process called therapeutic cloning. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If DNA from a patient is put into a human egg, which is then grown into an early embryo, the stem cells from that embryo would provide a virtual genetic match. So in theory, tissues created from them would not be rejected by the patient. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That idea was met with some ethical objections because harvesting the stem cells involved destroying human embryos. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Scientists have tried to get stem cells from cloned human embryos for about a decade, but they've failed. Generally, that's because the embryos stopped developing before producing the cells. In 2004, a South Korean scientist claimed to have gotten stem cells from cloned human embryos, but that turned out to be a fraud. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In Wednesday's edition of the journal Cell, however, scientists in Oregon report harvesting stem cells from six embryos created from donated eggs. Two embryos had been given DNA from skin cells of a child with a genetic disorder, and the others had DNA from fetal skin cells. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Shoukhrat Mitalipov of the Oregon Health & Science University, who led the research, said the success came not from a single technical innovation, but from revising a series of steps in the process. He noted it had taken six years to reach the goal after doing it with monkey embryos. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mitalipov also said that based on monkey work, he believes human embryos made with the technique could not develop into cloned babies, and he has no interest in trying to do that. Scientists have cloned more than a dozen kinds of mammals, starting with Dolly the sheep. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The new work was financed by the university and the Leducq Foundation in Paris. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dr. George Daley, a stem cell expert at Children's Hospital Boston who didn't participate in the work, called the new results \"one landmark step in a very long journey\" toward creating DNA-matched transplant tissue. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now, Daley said, scientists must compare the embryo-cloning approach with another technology that reprograms blood or skin cells directly into substitutes for embryonic stem cells. This reprogramming approach is technically simpler and doesn't involve embryos or require the donation of human eggs, and it was widely acclaimed when it was reported in 2007. Its Japanese developer shared a Nobel Prize last year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But these substitute cells show some molecular differences compared to embryonic ones, which has led to questions about whether they can safely be used for treating patients. So it's essential to compare the cells from the two methods, Daley said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The new results mean \"we have another tool,\" he said. \"We have to learn more about this tool.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Daley said he believed scientists will prefer using the reprogramming approach unless it can be proven \"beyond a shadow of a doubt\" that embryo cloning produces better cells for treating patients. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mitalipov said he believed his technique would present a particular advantage for treating patients with a certain type of rare diseases. These are caused by mutations in genes of the mitochondria, the power plants of cells. He noted his technique, unlike the cell-reprogramming approach, would supply tissue with new mitochondrial genes that could replace defective ones. Those new genes would come from the egg. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Rev. Tad Pacholczyk, director of education for National Catholic Bioethics Center, an independent think tank in Philadelphia, reiterated his opposition to embryo cloning, calling the approach unethical. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It involves the decision to utilize early human beings as repositories for obtaining desired cells,\" he said. \"You're creating them only to destroy them.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Marcy Darnovsky, executive director of the Center for Genetics and Society in Berkeley, California, said she was glad that Mitalipov doubted the embryos could be used to clone babies. She said the report still provides a good opportunity for the federal government to ban the use of cloning for reproduction. ||||| OHSU Photos NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It was hailed some 15 years ago as the great hope for a biomedical revolution: the use of cloning techniques to create perfectly matched tissues that would someday cure ailments ranging from diabetes to Parkinson\u2019s disease. Since then, the approach has been enveloped in ethical debate, tainted by fraud and, in recent years, overshadowed by a competing technology. Most groups gave up long ago on the finicky core method \u2014 production of patient-specific embryonic stem cells (ESCs) from cloning. A quieter debate followed: do we still need \u2018therapeutic\u2019 cloning? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A paper published this week1 by Shoukhrat Mitalipov, a reproductive biology specialist at the Oregon Health and Science University in Beaverton, and his colleagues is sure to rekindle that debate. Mitalipov and his team have finally created patient-specific ESCs through cloning, and they are keen to prove that the technology is worth pursuing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Therapeutic cloning, or somatic-cell nuclear transfer (SCNT), begins with the same process used to create Dolly, the famous cloned sheep, in 1996. A donor cell from a body tissue such as skin is fused with an unfertilized egg from which the nucleus has been removed. The egg \u2018reprograms\u2019 the DNA in the donor cell to an embryonic state and divides until it has reached the early, blastocyst stage. The cells are then harvested and cultured to create a stable cell line that is genetically matched to the donor and that can become almost any cell type in the human body. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Many scientists have tried to create human SCNT cell lines; none had succeeded until now. Most infamously, Woo Suk Hwang of Seoul National University in South Korea used hundreds of human eggs to report two successes, in 2004 and 2005. Both turned out to be fabricated. Other researchers made some headway. Mitalipov created SCNT lines in monkeys2 in 2007. And Dieter Egli, a regenerative medicine specialist at the New York Stem Cell Foundation, successfully produced human SCNT lines3, but only when the egg\u2019s nucleus was left in the cell. As a result, the cells had abnormal numbers of chromosomes, limiting their use. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Monkeying around NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mitalipov and his group began work on their new study last September, using eggs from young donors recruited through a university advertising campaign. In December, after some false starts, cells from four cloned embryos that Mitalipov had engineered began to grow. \u201cIt looks like colonies, it looks like colonies,\u201d he kept thinking. Masahito Tachibana, a fertility specialist from Sendai, Japan, who is finishing a 5-year stint in Mitalipov\u2019s laboratory, nervously sectioned the 1-millimetre-wide clumps of cells and transferred them to new culture plates, where they continued to grow \u2014 evidence of success. Mitalipov cancelled his holiday plans. \u201cI was happy to spend Christmas culturing cells,\u201d he says. \u201cMy family understood.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The success came through minor technical tweaks. The researchers used inactivated Sendai virus (known to induce fusion of cells) to unite the egg and body cells, and an electric jolt to activate embryo development. When their first attempts produced six blastocysts but no stable cell lines, they added caffeine, which protects the egg from premature activation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR None of these techniques is new, but the researchers tested them in various combinations in more than 1,000 monkey eggs before moving on to human cells. \u201cThey made the right improvements to the protocol,\u201d says Egli. \u201cIt\u2019s big news. It\u2019s convincing. I believe it.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The experiments took only a few months, Mitalipov says. \u201cPeople say, you did it in monkeys in 2007. Why did it take six years in humans?\u201d Most of the time, he says, was spent navigating US regulations on embryo research. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The researchers carried out a battery of tests to prove that their SCNT cells could form various cell types, including heart cells that are able to contract spontaneously. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Their first cell lines were created using fetal skin cells; others were derived using donor cells from an 8-month-old patient with a rare metabolic disorder called Leigh syndrome, to prove that ESCs could be made from more mature donor cells. The technique does not require prohibitive numbers of eggs: it took 15 from one donor to produce one cell line and 5 from a different donor to make another. \u201cThe efficiency was the most impressive thing,\u201d says George Daley, a stem-cell expert at Children\u2019s Hospital Boston in Massachusetts. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Such improvements might be necessary to convince people that SCNT research is still worthwhile. Egg donors for the experiment received US$3,000\u20137,000 in compensation. This is expensive and, according to some bioethicists, risks creating an organ trade that preys on the poor. Because the technique requires the destruction of embryos, funds from the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) cannot be used to make or study SCNT-derived cell lines, hampering further clinical research. (Mitalipov maintains a separate laboratory for NIH-funded research.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Public fears that the technology might be used to create human clones are another sticking point. The research might spark \u201ccloning hysteria\u201d that opponents of stem-cell research could capitalize on, says Bernard Siegel, executive director of the Genetics Policy Institute in Palm Beach, Florida. But Mitalipov has tried without success for more than a decade to produce a monkey by cloning. Tachibana says that an upcoming publication will explain why reproductive cloning of humans is not possible using their SCNT technique. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Still, Daley and most other stem-cell researchers have shifted to another method for creating genetically matched, patient-specific cell lines: reprogramming adult cells to an embryonic state to produce induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. First reported in 2006, the technique does not involve eggs, cloning or destruction of embryos4. \u201cHonestly, the most surprising thing [about this paper] is that somebody is still doing human [SCNT] in the era of iPS cells,\u201d says Miodrag Stojkovic, who studies iPS cells for regenerative medicine and runs a fertility clinic in Leskovac, Serbia. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Stojkovic, like others, awaits the results of head-to-head comparisons between iPS and SCNT cells. Some research has shown that iPS cells are not completely reprogrammed and that stem cells derived from SCNT are more like embryonic stem cells derived from in vitro fertilization. Mitalipov and Tachibana are now conducting a study to compare iPS cells and SCNT cells derived from the same donor cell. \u201cThese results,\u201d says Daley, \u201cwill be fascinating.\u201d\n",

In theory, the development by researchers at Oregon Health & Science University means that doctors might someday be able to grow tissue from an ailing patient's own DNA, thus reducing the chance of rejection in a transplant.

Photograph: Alberto Pizzoli/AFP/Getty Images NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a rare book heist described as \u201cextraordinary\u201d for its Mission: Impossible-style stealth, a gang of thieves has stolen more than \u00a32m worth of antiquarian books from a London warehouse. The three tome-raiders evaded the security system by boring holes through reinforced glass skylights and abseiling 40ft on ropes into the repository. The haul of more than 160 books included a 1566 copy of De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium by Copernicus, worth an estimated \u00a3215,000, as well as works by Galileo, Isaac Newton, Leonardo da Vinci and a 1569 edition of Dante\u2019s Divine Comedy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The question is, what happens to the books now? How might they be sold? And who would buy them? \u201cCriminals first try to cash out on these crimes,\u201d leading art lawyer Chris Marinello, CEO of London based Art Recovery International, tells me. \u201cThey are looking for buyers and the more publicity the crime gets, they more difficult it becomes to sell these items. Placing them on international databases, such as ARTIVE.org, which records stolen objects so they can not be sold knowingly in the marketplace, means reputable dealers and collectors will not touch them.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Marinello, who has been working to reduce the trade in illicit cultural heritage for three decades, explains that this, unfortunately, is when the \u201csecond crime\u201d often takes places. \u201cThe books might then be broken up,\u201d he says. \u201cSome of the illuminated manuscripts and engravings contained therein might be traded in the art market, where many buyers don\u2019t know they were cut out of rare books. It becomes a lot more difficult to trace.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The theft of rare books, manuscripts and maps from libraries and other repositories is thought to be on the rise. An alarmingly titled conference at the British Library in 2015, The Written Heritage of Mankind in Peril, was prompted by two major heists at European libraries, both of which turned out to be inside jobs. What continues to confound the international rare book market \u2013 estimated to be worth $500m (\u00a3380m) a year \u2013 is how easily stolen books are fenced and resold. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So what\u2019s the solution? \u201cIt\u2019s urgent at this point that the victims come forward and record these losses,\u201d Marinello says. \u201cIt\u2019s really important to make these books unsellable by disseminating that information. That\u2019s the key. In my experience the books will either turn up very shortly or when the criminals know they can\u2019t sell them they\u2019ll go underground and be traded or sold at 5%-10% of their true value. We might expect a ransom demand as well from someone looking to shake down an insurance company. The next few days and weeks are very important from an investigative point of view.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Does he believe, as some are saying, that the books might have been stolen to order by a specialist collector? \u201cI would strongly refute that,\u201d he replies. \u201cI think this was more likely similar to the Lufthansa heist in Goodfellas, where somebody had inside information that they were being kept in a warehouse and were particularly valuable. Then someone allowed that information to leak out, and criminals took advantage.\u201d\n",
        "summary": "\u2013 It was a heist worthy of Hollywood: Thieves targeted a London warehouse temporarily holding some of the world's rarest books, cut through its skylights, rappelled down, and made off with more than $3 million in bounty, reports the Telegraph. In total, the trio nabbed more than 160 books, and Business Insider notes that CCTV cameras show the thieves ignoring everything in the warehouse but four containers, the contents of which they checked against a list. \"This was a big job,\" Alessandro Meda Riquier, a dealer who lost about $1.6 million worth of books in the heist, tells the CBC. \"Police said that it took more than three hours to complete.\" The International League of Antiquarian Booksellers has published the complete list of stolen publications, but the \"jewel\" is a 1566 edition of De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium by Copernicus, the book in which he theorized that the sun, not the Earth, is at the center of our solar system. Other notables include a 1506 edition of Dante's Divine Comedy, and a copy of Isaac Newton's Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica. It smacks of an inside job, an art attorney tells the Guardian, likening it to the Lufthansa heist in the movie Goodfellas. \"Somebody had inside information that they were being kept in a warehouse and were particularly valuable,\" he says. \"Then someone allowed that information to leak out, and criminals took advantage.\u201d (One book dealer was murdered for his copy of a children's classic.)\n"

        "document": "Although infanticide occurs everywhere and at all levels of society, France seems to have been especially afflicted in the past three decades. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The most notorious case in recent years is that of V\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdronique Courjault, now 41, jailed in Tours last year after admitting murdering three babies and keeping their bodies in the family freezer. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In November 1984, Jean-Pierre Leymarie and his wife Rolande were jailed for killing seven newborns in Corr\u00e8ze. Four years later, Rosita Garnier, 38, was jailed by a court in Blois for murdering three newborns. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sylvie Coulon, 27, from Limoges, was jailed in 1990 for killing four infants and putting their bodies out with the rubbish. And C\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdline Lesage, 34, admitted the murder of seven babies found in a cellar in Normandy in 2007. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It's easy to come up with a narrative to explain why it happens in contemporary India or 17th-century Europe, for example, but why is it happening in 21st-century France?\" asks Michelle Oberman, author of When Mothers Kill. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The recent French cases also deviate sharply from the pattern in the US, she said, where the mother is usually very young, not in a relationship and who conceals the pregnancy from her parents, and then kills the child as soon as it is born. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One of the conditions often offered up to explain infanticide is \"pregnancy denial\", a psychiatric condition where a woman either doesn't realise or cannot accept she's having a baby, not even enough to consider an abortion. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Women can carry on menstruating, they don't put on weight and their breasts don't get bigger because the denial is so strong it overcomes the physical manifestations of pregnancy,\" explained Anne Carpenter, a consultant forensic clinical psychologist in Glasgow. When the baby arrives, she is forced to confront that reality, and sometimes with catastrophic results. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"With no sense of the child as an individual being, it is viewed more as an inconvenience, and something to be got rid of in the same way as you get rid of the trash,\" she added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But denial is not the only explanation. Pierre Lamothe, a French psychiatrist, said in many cases he had studied, the women wanted to be pregnant because it made them feel fully feminine, but they did not want children. \"When the child appears, it has no real existence,\" he said. \"Mentally, the woman does not accept that it is a living person.\" ||||| Pascal Rossignol / Reuters Candles are displayed in front of the house where the bodies of newborn babies were found in Villers-au-Tertre, France, on July 29, 2010 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The question is as horrifying as it is important to ask: Why are a rising number of French women killing their newborn babies? Finding the answer has become a matter of urgency following the discovery on Wednesday of eight infants allegedly smothered to death and buried by their mother in northern France. And with that case marking at least the fifth instance of multiple infanticide reported in France since 2003, it has become vital for the nation to confront the phenomenon that appears to be behind it all: a mental condition known as pregnancy denial. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This latest case of newborn murder in France was uncovered in the northern town of Villiers-au-Tertre, after eight tiny bodies were found buried in the gardens of two separate homes. Six of the cadavers were unearthed on July 29 by police at the house of Dominique Cottrez, 45, and her husband Pierre-Marie, 47. Investigators searched their home after the resident of a house previously owned by Dominique's parents turned up two tiny bodies on July 24 while digging a pool in the backyard. According to the French prosecutor leading the inquiry in the town, a short distance south of Lille, Dominique has admitted to hiding her pregnancies \u0097 and the killings of her babies \u0097 from her husband, whom police describe as being \"dumbstruck\" by the revelations. Dominique was charged for the murders; Pierre-Marie has been cleared of wrongdoing and released but could yet become a subject of investigation. (See the top 10 crime stories of 2009.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The case in Villiers-au-Tertre is only the most recent example of a father of slain babies being apparently unaware of his wife's pregnancies. Four other such cases since 2003 include that of V\u00e9ronique Courjault, 42, who was convicted in June 2009 of killing three of her newborns \u0097 two of whom she hid in a freezer and were later discovered by her husband. And this past March, C\u00e9line Lesage, 38, was found guilty of murdering six of her babies after she hid her pregnancies from the men who had fathered them. Both women were sentenced to prison \u0097 Courjault for eight years and Lesage for 15. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Experts explained those cases as resulting from pregnancy denial, an often misunderstood and minimized condition. According to Michel Delcroix, a former gynecologist who served as a court expert in the Courjault trial and others involving pregnancy issues, pregnancy denial is a quasi-schizophrenic condition in which women either don't realize or cannot accept that they are with child \u0097 not even enough to have an abortion. Whether these women are afflicted with the condition before they deliver or as they're suddenly giving birth, Delcroix explains, the psychological denial is so strong that they refuse to believe they're pregnant even when the reality confronts them. (See more on pregnancy.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"These women are so convinced pregnancy is impossible that once the child they never wanted arrives, they don't accept it as real and get rid of it to restore order to what they believe is nonpregnant reality,\" Delcroix says. \"However terrible its consequences, pregnancy denial acts in infanticide cases much as a psychotic state that drives someone to kill another person does. Yet we still try women for what they do during pregnancy denial when we don't try psychotic killers deemed not responsible for their actions.\" Delcroix and others who are fighting for pregnancy denial to be medically and legally recognized as an illness argue that improving ways to identify and treat these women makes more sense than simply punishing the crimes they commit as a result of it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What causes the condition? Several things, Delcroix says, including previous trauma such as beatings and rape. But other, nonphysical factors can also be involved, and denial can kick in even if a woman has already had and raised children without a problem \u0097 Lesage has a 14-year-old son; Dominique Cottrez has two grown daughters. And while pregnancy denial has been around for decades or longer, Delcroix says it's rising in frequency. The probable reason, he says, is changes in wider social factors that have downgraded the value of childhood, parenting and family. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But in some cases, it can also be a matter of women simply failing to see themselves as mothers. \"Some women never manage to update their self-identity during pregnancy, [while others] want to become pregnant without wanting to procreate,\" psychiatrist Pierre Lamothe told Le Parisien on Thursday. \"When the child arrives, it doesn't really exist for them. They don't give it life, in psychological terms. If they saw it as a [real] baby, they wouldn't kill it.\" (See the top 25 crimes of the past century.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Others just never realize \u0097 or acknowledge \u0097 that they're with child. Experts on pregnancy denial say most sufferers are either sufficiently overweight or experience such little body change that they simply assume they've gained some weight. In France, 230 women a year discover their pregnancy only while giving birth. Though just a fraction resort to infanticide, Delcroix fears there are more of those cases that remain undiscovered than there are ones that come to light, as in Villiers-au-Tertre. And he poses a chilling question: Does anyone really believe that the spreading phenomenon of pregnancy denial \u0097 and the infanticide it can lead to \u0097 is purely a French problem?\n",
        "summary": "\u2013 It's a good question. Why, asks Bruce Crumley in TIME, are French women killing their babies? It may have something to do with a little known, \"quasi-schizophrenic\" phenomenon called \"pregnancy denial,\" he finds. Women with this condition \"either don't realize or cannot accept that they are with child,\" a doctor says. And, he adds, it's not a French-only thing. Women can become \"so convinced pregnancy is impossible that once the child they never wanted arrives, they don't accept it as real and get rid of it,\" the doctor says. Or, as one psychologist tells the Independent, for some women a baby \"is viewed more as an inconvenience, and something to be got rid of in the same way as you get rid of the trash.\"\n"

Like the average American, it appears that she too, cannot stand her husband. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This afternoon in Tel Aviv, President Donald Trump reached for his wife\u2019s hand. Rather than indulge him with human touch, the sort of human touch regular married people who like each other might engage in, the reluctant First Lady swatted his hand away. This wasn\u2019t done backstage before an event, or in the privacy of a place where it was safe to assume there weren\u2019t any cameras. No, Melania has grown bolder in her push to telegraph her disdain for Donald. She did it as she and her husband joined Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife in a photo op. She did it in front of a veritable United Nations of news cameras. She did it so the whole world could see. She doesn\u2019t care if he\u2019s embarrassed, and it completely rules. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And the whole world did see; within minutes, the moment had gone viral. With that swat, Melania had temporarily sated the public\u2019s bottomless appetite to see President Trump denied what he wants in its most viscerally appealing manifestation. Trump wanted his wife to accept him, to join him in acting like a normal human couple for the cameras instead of an orb-fondling wannabe despot. Seeing tweets about a judge striking down an immigration ban, or watching a Trump surrogate make an ass of themselves on cable news just doesn\u2019t taste as delicious to a victory-starved liberal as the image of a woman slapping Trump\u2019s hand away. For the millions who continue to be horrified by the Trump era, there\u2019s nothing more zeitgeisty in 2017 than Trump schadenfreude porn. And there\u2019s nobody more well-positioned to deliver it than our Ice Queen First Lady. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This isn\u2019t the first time Melania has denied Donald\u2019s undersized hands the pleasure of human touch. In January, when the couple arrived in Washington for his inauguration, Donald tried to hold his wife\u2019s hand just before completing the very scary task of going down a flight of stairs. Melania was not having it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That move kicked off an inauguration weekend that, told from Melania\u2019s perspective, would read like a novel about a tragically trapped princess, or a live-action Pepe Le Pew cartoon starring Melania as the cat. When the couple danced, Melania leaned away rigidly. In every public appearance, the impeccably dressed First Lady wore a veil of despair. Her husband often seemed to forget that she existed. When they kissed, they did not touch. Melania acted like a mascot of left-wing despair. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the ensuing weeks, Melania\u2019s public disdain for her husband only intensified. An US Weekly cover story declared that she was \u201csecretly miserable\u201d as First Lady, an account I must dispute since it\u2019s always been obvious that she\u2019s miserable. She skipped out on typical first lady duties when the prime minister of Japan visited. And a couple of weeks ago, whoever manages her verified Twitter account favorited a Tweet about how alienated the Trumps seem from each other. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR All of this is occurring as Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka performs most of the non-romantic duties of First Lady, delivering speeches and posing for photos. In recent interviews, Ivanka\u2019s even started putting on a strange Jackie O affect. If I were Melania, I\u2019d find the whole thing irksome. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Critics will point out that Melania, of course, is no hero, and no saint. She\u2019s the one who married Donald, and she can leave whenever she gets sick of living in a golden box in the sky and feeling sorry for herself. There are plenty of women whose lives are much more worse off thanks to the president, and plenty more whose lives would be worse off if not for the saving grace of checks and balances. But her public acting out provides a nice bit of levity for a time that often feels devoid of it; a lot of women would love the opportunity to swat Trump\u2019s hand away. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Melania\u2019s swats also serve to expose another Trump lie: when you\u2019re a star, they don\u2019t always let you do it.\n",

That has triggered lots of coverage along these lines in the Daily News: She \"refused to hold her husband's hand and then slapped it away.\" A post at the Daily Beast raises the ante on that sentiment. But many also were taking a more middle-ground approach, hedging descriptions of Melania's action with phrases like \"appeared to be swatting\" (People) or \"seems to swat away\" (Los Angeles Times). The Washington Post, meanwhile, offered one of the most charitable explanations: \"Or maybe, upon close inspection of the footage, perhaps she just missed grabbing his outstretched hand, like a trapeze artist flubbing the catch,\" writes Emily Heil. She notes that Trumpian hand-holding is a favorite topic of White House watchers, meaning the two ought to at least \"work on their choreography\" if they want to avoid feeding the memes.

Treasury has advised that tobacco clearances fell by 3.4% in the 2013 calendar year relative to the 2012 calendar year and fell a further 7.9% in the 2014 calendar year. As at the end of 2014, tobacco clearances had fallen a total of 11.0% since 2012.These tobacco clearance rates do not take into account refunds of excise equivalent customs duty made under Customs\u2019 plain packaging related Tobacco Refund Scheme between December 2012 and May 2013. These refunds cannot be related to annual net clearances on a comparable basis to other data used to derive tobacco clearance rates.The tobacco excise rate was indexed to average weekly ordinary time earnings (AWOTE) from 1 March 2014 and there have been three of four 12.5% increases in the tobacco excise rate (1 December 2013, 1 September 2014, 1 September 2015) implemented. The next 12.5% increase will occur on 1 September 2016.As part of Health initiatives announced in the 2016 Budget, the Australian Government is reducing the allowable amount of duty free tobacco for travellers arriving in Australia.From 1 July 2017, travellers aged 18 years and over can only bring 25 grams of duty free tobacco, plus one open packet, into Australia. The tobacco can be in any form (cigarette, loose leaf and so on) and is equivalent to approximately 25 cigarettes.If you have more than this amount, you will be required to pay duty on all tobacco in your possession, unless you agree to dispose of the excess.Please ensure you are familiar with duty free limits when travelling to Australia.For more information on duty free limits, as well as what you can and cannot bring to Australia visit the Duty free concession page on the Department of Immigration and Boarder Protection website.There are a number of sources the Government relies on to monitor smoking rates, including data from national surveys conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW), and drug and alcohol information collected nationally from secondary school students by the Cancer Council Victoria.On 28 April 2016, the ABS released the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Survey, 2014-15.The survey was conducted from September 2014 to June 2015 with a sample of 11,178 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people living in private dwellings across Australia. The report shows that in 2014-15:On 8 December 2015, the ABS released the National Health Survey: First Results 2014-15.The survey was conducted in all states and territories and across urban, rural and remote areas of Australia (other than very remote areas) from July 2014 to June 2015, and included around 19,000 people in nearly 15,000 private dwellings. The report shows that in 2014-15:On 24 November 2015, the Cancer Council Victoria released the 2014 Australian secondary school students\u2019 use of tobacco report.The survey included over 23,000 secondary aged students aged between 12 and 17 years of age during months of June to December of the 2014 academic school year. The report shows that in 2014:On 25 November 2014, the AIHW released the 2013 National Drug Strategy Household Survey detailed report (2013 NDSHS).The survey collected data from 23,855 people across Australia aged 12 years and over living in private dwellings. The report shows that in 2013:Other 2013 NDSHS findings included:The 2013 NDSHS results do not reflect any impact from the Australian Government\u2019s 1 March 2014 change to bi-annual indexation of tobacco excise or the first of four 12.5% excise increases on tobacco products which took effect on 1 December 2013.Australia\u2019s low smoking rate is the result of sustained, concerted and comprehensive public policy efforts from all levels of government and action from public health organisations.Further information on the impact of tobacco plain packaging in Australia is available on the Evaluation of Tobacco Plain Packaging in Australia page ||||| Tweet with a location NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lawmakers in the UK hope the \"world's ugliest color\" will be helpful in lowering smoking rates in their country. In May, previously passed legislation will go into effect requiring all packs of cigarettes to be standardized. Tobaccos products will be stripped of brightly colored branding and replaced with a sludge-like color. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But does the stripped-down, \"ugly\" packaging really reduce smoking? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Researchers from the UK and Canada summarized several studies that look at the impact of tobacco packaging on consumer attitudes and behavior. Their findings were published today in a Cochrane Review NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jamie Hartmann-Boyce of the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group, co-author of the review, noted that \"the evidence we have so far suggests that standardized packaging may reduce smoking prevalence and increase quit attempts.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The UK law, passed last year, is similar to a cigarette standardization plan Australia enacted in 2012, which also features graphic health warnings and standardized fonts. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The muddy color -- Pantone 448C -- was chosen after marketing research company GfK Bluemoon was commissioned to develop ideas for unappealing cigarette packing. The agency asked Australian smokers about colors they found unappealing and overwhelming. Pantone 448 C was later named \"the world's ugliest color.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Respondents reportedly associated the color with the words \"dirty,\" \"tar\" and \"death.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I used to feature so much in all your 70s couches, curtains and wallpapers.

According to Angela Wright, a color consultant and author of \"The Beginner's Guide to Colour Psychology,\" the technique has been around for decades. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She cites American color consultant Faber Birren, who in the 1960s devised a way to stop department store employees from taking lengthy bathroom breaks. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The company asked him, 'Can you improve the working area so they don't have to leave all the time and use the restrooms?' \" Wright said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Birren actually took a different view and painted the restrooms in a color similar to Pantone 448C. And nobody wanted to spend time in the restrooms after that.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This is just one of the many examples that the \"world's ugliest color\" has been used to minimize appeal to control human behavior. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Is Pantone 448C really that bad? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What makes Pantone 448C so off-putting? Wright said she believes it's the association with human waste. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It makes perfect sense that smoking packets would use a vile green that looks like bodily fluids and makes people feel slightly nauseated,\" she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But not everyone agrees. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR France will also introduce plain cigarette packaging. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I actually quite like the color,\" said psychologist Dr. Carolyn Mair of the London College of Fashion, UAL. \"It's an earthy, muted, rich color, very much of nature. But then I also don't smoke.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Color in advertising NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The use of color can play a key role in brand perception among the public. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Blue is often used in services such as banking and law because of its association with loyalty, honesty and reliability,\" Mair said. Red meanwhile \"raises the pulse rate ... and communicates strength and high energy,\" Wright said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Color associations Red: Strength, energy, passion Blue: Focus, loyalty, calmness Yellow: Ego, optimism, openness Green: Balance, youth, eco-friendly Purple: Luxury, femininity, glamour Sources: Angela Wright, Carolyn Mair NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Football teams who have red uniforms are giving themselves more physical energy but also communicating to the opposite team that they are powerful and strong.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And purple has connotations with luxury, Mair said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Think of Cadbury chocolate (which has a purple logo). At least when it started out, it had the association with a glamorous, smooth, feminine brand,\" she added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Color combinations can also have powerful connotations. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the UK, the Esso petrol logo features red, white and blue -- much like many national flags, including those of the United States, Great Britain and France. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"So this combination can result in an instinctive loyalty,\" Wright said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The eye of the beholder NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That said, perception also plays a huge role -- as seen in Wright's and Mair's different responses to Pantone 448C. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Red could be seen as aggressive and demanding -- or as exhilarating and exciting,\" Wright said. \"Similarly, blue could be perceived as calming and well-thought-through -- or excessively bureaucratic and emotionless.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Wright sees the overwhelming color of our times as a bleak gray. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Gray is the color of austerity,\" Wright said. \"And we're going to keep wearing gray until we feel better financially.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That is, unless you feel compelled to lighten things with a splash of Pantone 448C. ||||| It\u2019s none of these.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And, after detailed research into which colours generated the most negative reactions among the general public, the dubious honour goes to Pantone 448C, also known as opaque couch\u00e9 \u2013 a sludgy brown colour that was alternately described by respondents as \u2018tar\u2019, \u2018dirty\u2019 and even \u2018death\u2019.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The world\u2019s most off-putting colour (Picture: Getty) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Well, because researchers believe it may be the key to cutting cigarette sales. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Back in 2012, researchers at Gfk Bluemoon were commissioned by the Australian government to design new packaging aimed at discouraging people from buying cigarettes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So, they set out to find the most offensive and unappealing shade in the colour spectrum to put on the packets. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Over 1,000 smokers took part in seven studies over a period of three months to identify the ugliest colour, with opaque couch\u00e9 coming out on top (or bottom, depending on how you look at it).

Medium olive was also considered a front-runner until it was rejected in the final stages for being \u2018too classy\u2019. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But, after three months, Pantone 448C was judged the ultimate turn-off and used to cover cigarette boxes across Australia. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And now, after the use of the new and very unexciting packaging has shown early success in curbing cigarette sales Down Under, the UK, Ireland and France have all developed plainer cigarette packaging, featuring, you\u2019ve guessed it, Pantone 448C.

        "summary": "\u2013 In 2012, a marketing research company determined Pantone 448 C (aka \"opaque couch\u00e9\") was the world's ugliest color\u2014and it's been used to try to save lives ever since. Per the Guardian, GfK surveyed 1,000 smokers back then to find out which hue turned them off the most, and this Pantone pick\u2014a greenish-brown blend that survey participants said reminded them of \"death\" and \"tar\"\u2014emerged the winner. Time notes the agency had been commissioned by the Australian government to find a color so repellent it could be used on cigarette packaging to discourage people from lighting up. The new color was found to have the most ability to \"minimize appeal\" and \"maximize perceived harm\" and was implemented on plain cigarette packs with health warnings across Australia, the Brisbane Times reported at the time. Early results are now in, and it appears the color that CNN describes as \"sludge-like\" may have made an impact: Cigarette sales have fallen, and now other countries such as the UK, France, and Ireland are following suit, per Metro. So what is it about the color that makes it such an effective sales deterrent? A color consultant tells CNN it may be the strong resemblance to, well, poop. But not everyone's on board with trashing opaque couch\u00e9. Pantone sniffs to the Guardian, \"At the Pantone Color Institute, we consider all colors equally,\" noting that the color's \"deep, rich earth tones\" make it a oft-chosen pick for sofas. But perhaps the saddest entity of all? The long-silent Pantone 448 C Twitter account, which back in 2012 reacted to the news of its denigrated status by tweeting, \"I used to feature so much in all your 70s couches, curtains, and wallpapers. What did I do to deserve this?\" (Speaking of ugly, this dating site rejects ugly people.)\n"

USA TODAY Sports NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cubs player Kyle Schwarber hits an RBI single against the Indians in the fifth inning of Game 2. (Photo: Charles LeClaire, USA TODAY Sports) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR CLEVELAND \u2014 It no longer defies imagination, but assaults the senses, wondering how sheer and utter fantasy could become reality. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR How in the world could a baseball player spend six months just learning to walk again after a devastating knee injury, not playing in a single game, and lead the Chicago Cubs to their first World Series victory since 1945, with a 5-1 victory over the Cleveland Indians, evening the Series at 1-game apiece? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It\u2019s the 'Legend of Kyle Schwarber,' \" catcher David Ross said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And the way this narrative is playing out, Cubs third baseman Kris Bryant predicts, it will soon be coming to a movie theater near you. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I can\u2019t even describe what he\u2019s doing right now,\" said left fielder Ben Zobrist, who\u2019s hitting .625 this series and is like a back-drop to center stage. \"No one\u2019s ever seen anything like it.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There has never been a position player in baseball history whose first hit of the season was in the World Series until Schwarber came along. He doubled off Cleveland ace Corey Kluber in Game 1, and then went 2-for-4 with two RBI and a walk in Wednesday\u2019s victory. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"He better not take one single swing in the offseason,\" first baseman Anthony Rizzo said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Indeed, the dude is making a total mockery out of spring training, let alone rehab assignments. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This is a guy who had no hits in four at-bats in April before he blew out his left knee. He had one hit in eight at-bats in the Arizona Fall League. Now, on baseball\u2019s greatest stage, he is hitting .429, reaching base five times in nine at-bats, with a double, two singles and two RBI. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If he keeps this up, and Schwarber leads the Cubs to their first World Series title since 1908, there will be generations of Schwarbers who will never have to pay for a drink or adult beverage in their lifetimes in the city of Chicago. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"If we win three more,\" Rizzo said, \"he doesn\u2019t have to take another swing in his life. Take your time, and enjoy your life.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Considering that Schwarber has all of four months of baseball experience on his bubble-gum card, and is baseball\u2019s ultimate gym rat, there\u2019s a better chance of him conducting hitting lessons when he\u2019s 80 than ever giving up this gig. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"He\u2019s just a dirt bag,\" Rizzo said. \"He\u2019s always around the field. He\u2019s always watching baseball. Always watching film. Sometimes, too much. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"When he was on the DL, he\u2019s there watching film, studying scouting reports, and I would yell at him, 'What are you doing? What are you doing?' \" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Who realized all along that Schwarber was secretly plotting his comeback? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Baseball\u2019s a crazy game,\" Schwarber said. \"It will do crazy things to you.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So crazy, that he went along with the Cubs\u2019 narrative, that he would be out for the season. When you tear two knee ligaments, no one expects to see you until next season. If he had only sustained the injury earlier, maybe in spring training, he\u2019d have a chance, but not during the season. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And even if he was physically able to return before the end of the season, there would be no time for a minor-league rehab assignment, no time to get down his timing, no time to see major-league pitching. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"That\u2019s why we\u2019re calling it 'The Legend of Kyle Schwarber,' \" Ross said. \"That\u2019s who does this. It just blows my mind what he\u2019s doing. He\u2019s doing things that are unheard of.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Yet, on baseball\u2019s biggest stage, in front of millions on national TV, Schwarber is turning the World Series into his own reality TV show. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Watch Schwarber become the Cubs\u2019 first DH in World Series history. Watch Schwarber hit. Watch Schwarber run. Watch Schwarber drive in two runs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Oh, and if you need to tug at the heartstrings too, watch Schwarber become emotional talking about his 10-year-old friend, Campbell Faulkner of Queen Creek, Ariz. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Faulkner, diagnosed with a rare form of mitochondrial disease, has a team of 13 doctors. He struggles to stand and walk for extended periods of time. He needs two feeding tubes in his stomach just to provide him with nutrition. He missed nearly 100 days of school last year because of his illness and doctor appointments. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Schwarber met him in spring training and saw him last weekend before meeting the Cubs in the World Series. Faulkner is his friend, and Schwarber wears a bright green wristband in his honor to make those aware of the disease. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Really young, smart kid, and he\u2019s just always got a big smile on his face,\" Schwarber said. \"You know, that draws your attention to him. He\u2019s living life to his fullest, even though he\u2019s got something to overcome. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"He\u2019s just a good kid. How could you not like him?\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It\u2019s all part of the legend of Schwarber, the 23-year-old who became the Cubs\u2019 all-time postseason home run leader last year by hitting five homers in just 27 at-bats, and now is doing what no one can possibly believe they\u2019re seeing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"For a guy to be able to do something like this,\" winning pitcher Jake Arrieta said. \"is just ... I\u2019m kind of speechless.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the words of Cleveland manager Terry Francona, who suffered his first World Series loss a manager in 10 games: \"I can see why Theo (Epstein) sent a plane for him. I would too. That\u2019s a lot to ask, but special players can do special things.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Epstein, president of the Cubs, was stunned when the six-month medical reports last week revealed Schwarber was a month ahead of schedule. Schwarber was so excited, he asked for permission to go to the Arizona Fall League, to see how he looked. He played two games, did all the agility drills, ran the bases, slid, and with Epstein watching the video of him on his computer, took the gamble. He sent a private plane for him Monday, and on Tuesday, was in the starting lineup batting fifth. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now, the question an inquiring, starving, championship-drought fan base wants to know: Could the Cubs dare put him in the field this weekend against the Indians? They are going back to National League rules. There will be no DH at Wrigley Field. Can he possibly play the field when he hasn\u2019t played the outfield since tearing two knee ligaments on April 7? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"He may be catching for all we know,\" Rizzo said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Well, it\u2019s safe to say he won\u2019t be catching until next spring, but considering the way he\u2019s running the bases every time he\u2019s aboard, there\u2019s a certain manager who will be pushing for the cause. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I'm waiting to hear from our guys from our medical side,\" Cubs manager Joe Maddon said, \"because obviously he looks good. He looks good at the plate. Running the bases, he looks pretty good so far. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"There's nothing about watching him that tells me that he's inhibited right now. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"He\u2019s a different cat, he absolutely is.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It\u2019s one thing if there had been the scintilla of discussion that Schwarber could possibly be ready for the playoffs, even privately among the Cubs\u2019 front office. Or even if Schwarber had told a few teammates that this was his secret plan all along. But nothing. Absolutely nothing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sure, there were times during the season when Schwarber would tease his teammates, saying he\u2019d be back for that day-night doubleheader in August against the Milwaukee Brewers, and everyone would laugh. It was a running joke all season. The laughter stopped when Rizzo was having dinner with strength coach Tim Buss before Game 3 of the NLCS in Los Angeles. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I said, 'What?' \" Rizzo said. \" 'Seriously? For real?' I couldn\u2019t believe it.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Cubs still can\u2019t. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I just took it day by day,\" Schwarber said. \"There were days I just wasn\u2019t feeling it. My teammates picked me up and I had some guys come over and say to me, 'World Series, you\u2019re coming back.\u2019 I\u2019d just laugh it off. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Then, when it came to reality, it was a shock.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Imagine how the rest of us feel. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The Legend of Kyle Schwarber,\" Ross slowly said again. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Stay tuned. The sequel is Friday, the first World Series night game in Wrigley Field history. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"They are going to go nuts,\" Ross said.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bryant might be right. But even after two jaw-dropping performances, the climax of \u201cLegend: The Amazing Comeback of Kyle Schwarber,\u201d lies ahead. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Yes, the word, \u201clegend,\u201d is admittedly lofty for a player who is only 23, but that\u2019s the description several of his teammates chose, not me. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Filming resumes Friday night at Wrigley Field, in Game 3 of the World Series, with the Cubs and Indians tied at one game each. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The next plot twist \u2014 \u201cWill Schwarbs be in left field?\u201d \u2014 likely will not be a twist at all. He will be in left. He will receive a standing ovation for the ages. He will hit a ball into Lake Michigan, and then ride a chariot down Michigan Avenue, woe to any billy goat that stands in the way. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Cubs, according to president of baseball operations Theo Epstein, have yet to decide whether Schwarber will be in the outfield. Doctors initially cleared him only to hit and run the bases, serve as a DH. But the Cubs will talk to the doctors again on Friday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The team does not intend to put Schwarber in jeopardy. But Epstein and others say they view him as healed from the surgery he underwent to repair two damaged ligaments a little more than six months ago. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cHe\u2019s got tremendous strength and flexibility in the knee, as demonstrated by what he\u2019s done out there,\u201d Epstein said, referring to Schwarber\u2019s double and walk in Game 1, his two RBI singles and walk in Game 2, the quality of his at-bats overall. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cWe\u2019ll see. If he does end up playing out there, we\u2019ll make sure he\u2019s smart about it. If he doesn\u2019t, we\u2019ll put him in a big spot (as a pinch-hitter) to take one of the most important at-bats of the game.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Three days ago, a lot of people thought the Cubs were nuts to even consider giving Schwarber his first start since April 7 in Game 1 of the World Series. Now, many of those same people are saying, \u201cHow can the Cubs not keep playing him?\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There is risk. There is always risk. At some point, this becomes a question of protecting Schwarber from himself. \u201cHe\u2019ll run through a wall. He\u2019ll do anything,\u201d Cubs general manager Jed Hoyer said. \u201cBut that\u2019s on us to make sure we check all the right boxes.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Schwarber prepared for the Series by tracking 1,300 pitches from a pitching machine at the Cubs\u2019 spring-training facility in Mesa, Az. He did not, however, track 1,300 flyballs. And he was a below-average outfielder even before he got injured in a collision with center fielder Dexter Fowler. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Still, as Epstein indicated, the Cubs can proceed with relative caution. Replace Schwarber for defense if they get a lead. Use him off the bench in Games 4 and 5, when two flyball pitchers, John Lackey and Jon Lester, are scheduled to pitch. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Heck, the Cubs will benefit even if Schwarber cannot play the field and is limited to one at-bat per game. In Game 1, Schwarber hit a double off a dominant Corey Kluber and drew a walk off the hellacious Andrew Miller. In Game 2, he drilled one RBI single off Trevor Bauer on a 3-0 count, the other off reliever Bryan Shaw after falling behind 0-2. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He has seen 40 pitches in nine plate appearances, a rate that would nearly have led the majors if sustained over a full season. He is hitting as if he missed no time, taking pitches inches off the plate, repeating his short, powerful swing with seemingly no effort. You hear baseball people talk about players who can roll out of bed and hit. Schwarber practically did. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThe professional at-bats just blow my mind,\u201d catcher David Ross said. \u201cThe eye he has at the plate, taking pitches, taking walks. There is not a more impressive thing that I\u2019ve seen in a long time than the Andrew Miller at-bat (Tuesday). I thought (manager) Joe (Maddon) might pinch-hit for him. Who\u2019s the idiot? Me.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Yet, the Cubs are the people least surprised by all this. They understand that Schwarber possesses rare offensive gifts.

        "summary": "\u2013 Even those not paying close attention to the World Series might be hearing the name Kyle Schwarber being thrown around a lot after the first two games. As in, \"The Legend of Kyle Schwarber\" as the Chicago Cubs catcher puts it, per USA Today. The 23-year-old suffered a devastating knee injury in the third game of the season on April 7 and sat out the rest of the year. In a surprise move, the Cubs put him back in the lineup for the World Series as a designated hitter. After doubling in Game 1\u2014one of the few bright spots for the Cubs that game, which came after TV analyst Pete Rose predicted he'd strike out three times\u2014Schwarber had two RBI singles in the Cubs' Game 2 victory and scored another run himself. He's batting .429 with two walks. \"They're going to make movies about him,\" says teammate Kris Bryant. No position player has ever recorded his first hit of the season in the World Series. And his \"eye\" at the plate is astonishing his teammates, notes the Chicago Tribune. The problem for the Cubs is that Schwarber is not medically cleared to play the outfield, but that could change before Friday's game in Chicago, where no designated hitter is allowed. But \"the next plot twist\u2014 \u201cWill Schwarbs be in left field?'\u2014likely will not be a twist at all,\" writes Ken Rosenthal at Fox Sports. \"He will be in left. He will receive a standing ovation for the ages. He will hit a ball into Lake Michigan, and then ride a chariot down Michigan Avenue, woe to any billy goat that stands in the way.\"\n"

        "document": "AFTER THE 76ERS had acquired Julius Erving before the 1976-77 season, the team went on a run of being eliminated in the NBA Finals three times and the Eastern Conference Finals twice in a six-year span. While those teams were composed of other star-level players such as Doug Collins, George McGinnis, Bobby Jones, Darryl Dawkins and Lloyd Free, to name a few, there was an ingredient missing. Billy Cunningham, who took over as head coach before the 1977-78 season, knew exactly what it was. \"What we needed was that physical presence,\" Cunningham said yesterday. \"As good as Darryl and Caldwell Jones were, they weren't able to take us to the next level. With Doc [Erving] and Bobby Jones and the others, we had great athletes. We needed exactly what we got.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What the Sixers got in the summer of 1982 was Moses Malone, the player everyone thought could take the organization to the promised land. He delivered, carrying the team to its only title since the 1967 season. Though he promised to deliver the title in \"Fo', fo', fo' \" fashion, the team actually needed 13 games to garner the championship after a sweep of the Los Angeles Lakers in the championship series. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Malone passed away yesterday morning in his sleep in Norfolk, Va., at the age of 60. Sadly, the two players from whom Malone took over the center position - Dawkins and Caldwell Jones - also died in the past year, from heart attacks. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In his first season with the Sixers, Malone won MVP honors by averaging 24.5 points and 15.3 rebounds during the regular season in which the team compiled a 65-17 record. In those 13 playoff games, in which the Sixers stomped their way to the championship in three series, Malone averaged 26 points and 15.8 rebounds, garnering Finals MVP. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I was just with him and Darryl at the ceremony at the Wells Fargo Center when the team unveiled their new uniforms [in mid-June] and then had lunch with Moses and Bobby Jones a couple of weeks after that,\" Cunningham said. \"As always, he was so much fun to be around.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When the name of Moses Malone comes up, it is usually followed by laughs and a story. John Nash, who was assistant general manager for the Sixers when Malone was acquired from the Houston Rockets, shared one yesterday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I could write a play about us acquiring Moses,\" said Nash. \"[Owner] Harold Katz called me on a Sunday and said he wanted to get it done. But he was in Las Vegas, [general manager] Pat Williams was in China with Julius on a goodwill tour for the NBA, Billy was in North Carolina on a golf trip and Moses was in Houston. Somehow, we got everyone together, except for Billy, at 7 o'clock that Tuesday night in the Grand Hyatt in New York. We waited for Billy for about 30-to-45 awkward minutes before he came into the room, with his golf clubs over his shoulder. When we asked what took him so long, he said the cab ride was too expensive from Newark Airport, so he took the train in. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It took until 2:30 in the morning to iron things out, and about two weeks later the deal was finally officially done - though Moses decided to go on a radio station in Virginia the morning after we talked and announced he had signed with the Sixers. It was crazy.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At the time, the deal was the largest for a player in team sports. Malone's contract was for six years at $2.2 million a season. After he averaged 23.9 points and 13.4 rebounds in four seasons, the Sixers traded him and forward Terry Catledge to the Washington Bullets for Jeff Ruland in one of the most-hated deals in Philly sports history. He would return in 1993-94 and average 17.1 points and 13.2 rebounds at age 38 in his next-to-last season. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But few players in this city's sports history, maybe none, connected with the fans with their style of play the way Malone did. There was that ever-present scowl when he was on the court, soaked with sweat, and that jovial smile and large laugh when he was off it that drew so many to embrace him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"When we got him, we knew all about him,\" said Maurice Cheeks, the starting point guard on that 1983 team. \"He was an MVP. He had great numbers. But we didn't know who he was. Well, it didn't take long for us to mesh with him on the court, and it certainly didn't take long to love him off of it, too. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"When I think of Moses, besides the numbers and the great player, he was a great person. I just think of that laugh. I can still hear it. He would still tease me about pancakes. We had a noon game one time in Milwaukee and Moses was a little late coming down from his room. He saw me eating pancakes and asked me for some. I said no and he couldn't believe it. He teased me for years about those pancakes. It breaks me down to think this has happened.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In that initial meeting in New York, Cunningham pulled Malone aside and let him know his expectations of the player who had won MVP honors in Houston the previous season by averaging 31.1 points and 14.7 rebounds. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Before we signed, we went into a room and I asked if he could deal with what we want to do,\" Cunningham said. \"I said that we expected him to rebound defensively and get it out and let us run as much as we could, then we'd look for you inside. He said he was 100 percent on board. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"A lot of players were unsettled by the trades we made, popular guys like Darryl and Caldwell. But after two days in training camp with Moses, they understood. Moses' favorite player was Julius. He would just like to play, leave and not talk to anybody. His hero was Doc and he wanted to win it for him. Moses was the smartest player I've been around in my life. Moses knew every player, their strengths and weaknesses, everybody on the court. He was just a basketball junkie.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Malone grew up in Petersburg, Va., and signed a contract with the ABA's Utah Stars following high school. He played two seasons in the ABA before bursting onto the scene in the NBA, where he played 19 seasons. He was a 12-time NBA All-Star, won three MVPs and led the league in rebounding six times. He averaged at least 20 points for 11 straight seasons, was named to the league's 50th anniversary all-time team in 1995 and was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Hall of Fame in 2001. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Said Sixers CEO Scott O'Neil in a statement: \"It is with a deep sense of sadness that the Sixers family mourns the sudden loss of Moses Malone. It is difficult to express what his contributions to this organization - both as a friend and player - have meant to us, the city of Philadelphia and his faithful fans.
